they
recommend
we
eat
at
green
for
vegan
food

then
return
every
day
for
either
lunch

dinner

the
remainder
of
our
trip
once
i
arrive
in

use
to

once

a
take

be
delicious
not
really
super
healthy

the

i
can
deal
with
that

take
a

they
do
it
well

use

get
a

the
calexico

good

you
will
need
a
siesta
afterwards

personally
prefer
when
not
a
lot
of
meat
substitute

use
in
vegan
food

be
the
only
reason

i

give
green

a
meat

seitan

you
can
avoid
this

order
something

run

ask

i
felt
a
little
awkward

it

negative
be
the
way
that
the

scream
your

up

the

my

the

with

the
burger
be
suppar
the
patty
be
more
of
a
ground
meat
texture
than
a
patty
so
it
break
apart
easily
the
flavor
wasnt
really
there

it
take
ketchup

siracha
sauce
to
bring
it
up
the
fry

very
very
good
thin
cut
light

a
highlight

for

it

almost

only
complaint
be
the
price
you
really
dont
get
for
what
you
pay
for
the
portion

a

the

about

we
could

a

more

i
decide
to
rewrite
my
review
for
green
since
then
i
have
be
hand
a
plethora
of
new
information
about
their
menu
that
might
make
it
more
appeal
for
almost
anyone
one
of
my
previous
complaint
be
that
besides
some
of
their
sandwich
and
their
salad
their
food
be
particularly
oily
or
greasy
etc
i
think
this
place
be
too
good
not
to
have
some
sort
of
alternative
to
this
situation
and
guess
what
there
be
a
solution
i
admit
i
prematurely
judge
the
cuisine
before
ask
enough
question
turn
out
almost
everything
on
the
menu
especially
the
entree
be
customizable
to
the
point
that
you
can
almost
make
anything
on
the
menu
fit
your
preference
and
the
staff
be
more
than
accommodating
and
gracious
about
it
i
have
since
have
a
lot
of
item
on
the
menu
and
be
able
to
get
many
item
to
fit
my
dietary
preference
sandwich
the
wendy
pickle

a
great
customizable
one

have
try
with
le
oil
steam

light
sauce

the
salad
i
have
swap
out
the
meat
for
different
kind
of
tofu
or
light
sauce

almost
every
time
my
food

be
delicious

it

it

option
for

it
available
my
only
complaint
be
the
fing
line
you
have
to
wait
in
when
you
show
up
due
to
it
be
in

and
basically
the
only
vegan
place
around
that
wait
time
be
insane
i
go
in
at
on
a
friday
and
the
line
be
out
the

literally
and
i
have
phone
my
order
in
at
it
be
do

and
i
sat
in
that
line
for
almost
minute
also
the
staff
look
like
they
hat
their
job
not
a
single
smile
on
any
of
their
face
the
food
be
worth
it
though
the
quality
of
food
be
all
in
all
pretty
good
just
make
sure
if
you
choose
to
go
here
to
plan
accordingly
this
be
not
somewhere
you
can
show
up
for
a
quick
bite
to
eat
there
be
a
wait
time
and
the
staff
could
give
a
sh
t
le
how
long
you
wait
i
personally
can
get
over
that
stuff
for
some
good
food

i
do
not
have
to

the

that
they
have

on

far
too
salty

it
come
with

daiya
instead

teese
daiya

better

atmosphere
be
very
artsy

a
bunch

her

limited
i
am
not
say
they
should
offer
nonvegan
food

i
am
say
they
could
add
a
few
more
normal
nonmeat
choice
maybe
a
few
more
salad
a
veggie

be
something
that
might
attract
someone

to

good

the
cleanliness

the

go

get
a

with
some
green

be
more
than
just
the
garnish

some

it
be
a

spicy

than
i
have
expect
i
realize
the
description

spicy
garlic

i
assume
the
spicy
mean
the
garlic

not
the
red
chili
pepper

be
also
in
there

keep
read
about
the
thyme
fry
so

my
second
visit
i
decide
to
take
the
leap
and
order
the
fry

be
rare

also
order
the
peanut

a

it

be
a
conservative
republican
catholic
and
i
love
green
i
often
like
to
come
here
after
work
it
be
right
in
the
middle
of
my
mile
commute
and
so
i
can
easily
walk
here
eat
and
walk
to
the
next
bus
stop
so
if
you
see
me
in
my
work
uniform
i
work
at
a
catholic
parish
you
will
know
that
i
think
it
be
worth
the
walk
i
especially
enjoy
come
here
on
friday
when
i
abstain
from
meat
now
i
could
be
somewhere
eat
seafood
or
dairy
or
egg
but
i
choose
green
because
the
food
be
just
that
good
my
motto
hippy
have
the
best
food
restaurant
usually
try
to
be
apolitical
the
key
to
a
good
restaurant
be
mostly
in
not
offend
anyone
ideology
green
decor
and
ambiance
be
clearly
quirky
and
offbeat
and
appeal
mostly
to
young
hipster
but
you
can
tell
that
the
only
politics
important
here
be
kindness
to
animal
and
care
for
the
environment
i
can
get
behind
these
thing
i
have
be
here
many
time
now
it
be
become
even
more
of
a
regular
thing
a
i
get
use
to
the
threeblock
walk
in
between
bus
i
have
try
various
dish
and
they
are
all
fantastic
some
of
the
best
be
the
lemon
pesto
bowl
and
the
chili
fry
with
cheese
i
have
also
have
edamame
samosa
and
no
harm
chicken
parm
all
great
once
i
have
a
mock
burger
that
be
weird
and
would
have
be
substandard
even
for
jack
in
the
box
but
i
am
happy
to
ignore
the
outlier
when
the
rest
be
delish
lately
i
have
quite
enjoy
my
share
of
vanilla
almond
milk
shake
i
be
sure
these
have
more
than
a
few
calorie
but
it
definitely
a
refreshing
treat
on
a
hot
day
and
the
portion
be
not
huge
so
i
do
not
feel
that
guilty
about
indulge
the
price
be
right
everything
be
so
reasonable
and
the
server
be
superfriendly
and
nice

especially
nice
feature

big

green

be
synonymous

no

good
quality

i
can
eat
their

chili
fry

the
bucket

still
feel
good
after
tip
add
some
sriracha
to
the
ketchup
to
add
more
punch
to
the
fry

put
off
your
doubt
and
reservation

give
green
a
try
maybe
you
will
find
out
like
me
that
sometimes
eat
green
be
a
good
alternative
to
pork

realistically
i
probably
would
not

the
difference
between

american
cheese

it
hardly

[
for
some
odd
reason
i
get
a
wild
hair
up
my
butt
and
want
to
try
a
vegetarian
restaurant
i
still
have
no
idea
why
my
wife
and
i
be
not
vegan
or
anything
close
to
it
but
i
still
want
to
try
something
new
and
exciting
i
want
something
close
to
home
and
green
be
rat
the
best
in
my
area
so
i
figure
what
the
heck
the
place
look
exactly
like
what
i
expect
i
be
totally
preppy
so
my
only
word
to
describe
it
be
hippy
the
place
be
pretty
pack
with
weird
hippy
people
but
everyone
be
very
nice
it
be
not
really
my
scene
but
it
do
not
matter
because
i
be
there
for
the
food
and
a
new
experience
when
my
wife
and
i
first
enter
the
establishment
we
first
wait
for
a
hostess
to
seat
for
a
few
second
then
after
figure
out
that
it
be
probably
a
seat
yourself
type
of
place
we
take
a
seat
and
wait
for
a
waitresswaiter
most
of
the
other
table
have
people
look
over
menu
so
we
figure
that
a
waitresswaiter
take
order
after
a
few
minute
of
sit
we
decide
that
we
should
probably
go
up
to
the
counter
and
order
not
that
i
have
a
problem
with
it
it
just
that
it
be
very
confusing
anyway
here
be
the
rundown
of
what
we
order
and
my
rating
of
it
spicy
buffalo
wing
they
do
not
look
like
it
but
they
do
have
the
texture
and
flavor
of
real
wing
kinda
the
sauce
be
good
and
spicy
but
be
very
very
salty
the
ranch
be
good
too
i
would
order
this
again
artichoke
gratine
very
good
and
pretty
spicy
i
would
order
again
green
burger
neither
myself
or
my
wife
be
a
fan
of
this
diablo
red
bowl

actually
think
this
be
good
aside
from
it
be
very
very
very
very
salty
the
dish
be
very
flavorful
and
have
a
nice
kick
to
it

order
it
with
mock
beef
which
somehow
have
the
texture
and
flavor
of
beef

in
all

this
place
be
ok

staff

friendly

food
be
ready
quickly

the
price
be
reasonable

only
real
issue
be
with
the
food
since
i
do
not
have
any
issue
eat
meat
i
would
just
assume
go
to
a
place
that
serve

through

the

be
the
po
boy
i
do
not
love
it

it
be
not
gross

remind
me
more
of
style
vegetarian
food
i
use
to
be
vegan
and
miss
pizza
greatly
the
pizza
i
eat
here
when
my
tastebud
be
still
veganoriented
tell
me
that
the
pizza
be
good
though
i
still
have
not
have
vegan
pizza
that
supasses
a
pizza
with
real
cheese
on
it
i
order
a
salad
here
once
but
unfotunately
i
ca
not
remember
what
type
of
salad
what
i
can
remember
be
that
i
like
it
and
that
it
taste
fresh
nothing
worse
than
old
salad
green
which
this
do
not
have
the
hummus
be
rich
and
have
a
nice
touch
of
chipotle
and
they
do
not
make
it
a
gross
a
some
other
place
do
i
mean
when
nonmediterraneannonmiddle
eastern
restaurant
make
hummus
for
some
reason
they
usually
go
out
of
their
way
to
make
it
a
unhummuslike
and
unappealing
a
possible
this
hummus
be
not
exactly
like
that
find
in
a
mediterranean
restaurant
but
the
direction
that
it
veer
off
the
standard
hummus
path
be
a
tasty
direction
not
a
pointlessly
nauseate
one
the
buffalo
wing
be
salty
but
flavorful
and
i
love
the
vegan
ranch
dress
that
come
with
them

have
try
to
make

excite

that
there
be
no
meat
they
just
make
great

usually
get
one
of

come
in

worry
about
my
sugar
intake

to
me
on

seem
a
bit
dare
for
a
vegan

they
be
great

i
get
them
all
the
time
i
would
not
recommend
a
vegan
pizza

you
know
what
you
be
get
yourself
into
my
mostly
vegetarian
daughter
live
off
of
cheese
and
mushroom
pizza

could
not
stomach
the
vegan
verity
now
she
have
the
crab
puff
and
peanut
tofu
appetizer

my

she
want

have
to
ask
about
unmentioned
ingredient

i
have

like
it

question
about

those

real
what
be
that
which
give
me
a
chance
to
point
out
that
reusing
be
even
better
than
recycle
although
both
have
merit
a
few
more
visit
to

i
am
sure
my

will
know
what
i
am
talk
about

our

the
original

better

i
say
it

i
should
try

a
little
wary
about

i
have
look
at
the
yelp
review
on
this

it
be
within
walk
distance

give
it
a
try

definitely
not
disappointed

very
welcome

ethereal

there
be
other
in

speak
with
the
young
lady
her
name
escape
me
now
at
the
counter

be
very
friendly

knowledgeable

tell
her
truthfully
that
i
be
not
a
vegetarian

do
she
have
any
suggestion
at
her
direction

it
i
do
not
miss
the
chicken
the

spicy

the

very
good
a
little
greasy

not
a
good
a
the
real

actually
cheat

have
fantastic
buffalo
wing
and

first

bowl

fantastic
the
mock
chicken
be
delicious
the
mushroom
be
so

this

the
clear
winner

okay

the
only
texture
in

i
love
it
in

with
bean

otherwise
it
be
just
not
chewy
enough
for
me
the
fry
be
good
but
we
do
not
get
any
thyme
flavor
the
buffalo
wing
be
so
yummy
the
first
bite
definitely
do
not
taste
like
chicken
but
once
you
get
the
wing
sauce
in
your
mouth
you
could
imagine
this
be
the
real
thing
i
happen

love

wing

for
me
to
like
these
be

big
win

miso
bowl
with
fried
tofu

bland

me

offensive

my
dining
partner

just
have
a
bite

felt
it
be
quite
underseasoned
he
find
the
smell
and
the
taste
godawful
and
he
could
not
eat
it
after
bite
one
not
be
one
to
send
it
back
he
just
eat
the
rest
of
the
stuff

leave
the
bowl

pack
up
the
leftover

dissapointing
the

portabello
in
their

unique
and
delicious
but
it
be
really
a
let
down
the

be
altogether
too
sweet
the
pepper
be
saute

a
point
of
sadness

they
just
contribute
even
more
sweetness

be
a

seem
to
have
steal
all
of
the
flavour

from
the
texas
very
hot
i
enjoy

so
it

fine
for
me
but
i
caution
more
sensitive
bud
and
too
greasy
for
my
taste

the
pizza
be
the
big
misfire
i
have
hear
good
thing
about
the
type
of
vegan

they
use

definitely
want
to
try

we
be

agree
even
scrap
it
off

the
sauce
be
nice
but
the
mushroom
and
onion
again
be
too
oily

the
veggeroni
be
just
storebought
yuck
i
be
hop
for
some
homemadelessprocessed
seitan
or
something
the
crust
be
just
a
thin
flatbread
which
i
do
not
like
for

the

be
tasty

thinly

shut
down

out

definitely
go

do
not

actual

if
the

go
ahead

them

order

the
best

my
life
skinny
little
crispy

not
too
crunchy
delicious

pretty

hate
all
other
fry

green
the
eggless
roll

good
too

i
really
like
the
sweet
sauce

come
with
my
boyfriend
order
the
original
g
spicy
poboy

be
good

i
think
the

order
be
better

we
go
we
split

[
i
should
preface
this
review
by
state
that
i
be
not
a
vegetarian
i
be
especially
not
vegan
i
be
a
shameless
meat
and
diary
eater
but
i
be
open
to
experiment
with
different
cuisine
and
always
look
to
try
healthier
food
green
be
a
restaurant
that
i
have
drive
by
countless
time
and
always
tell
myself
that
i
should
give
it
a
try
i
finally
do
last
night
and
i
be
not
terribly
disappointed
while
it
still
not
food
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
appreciate
the
level
of
quality
green
offer
i
decide
to
take
an
adventurous
route
and
try
the
original
g
spicy
poboy
i
consider
this
adventurous
because
the
idea
of
mock
chicken
do
not
sit
well
with
me
the
real
thing
taste
better
and
the
health
differential
be
open
to
debate
the
sandwich
be
decent
but
small
it
only
a
poboy
in
spirit
if
you
have
ever
be
to
new
orleans
and
have
a
poboy
you
would
know
that
they
be
obnoxiously
oversized
and
stuff
with
lettuce
tomato
and
your
choice
of
fish
or
meat
what
save
this
sandwich
be
the
sauce
it
perfectly
hot
and
the
tofu
absorbs
all
of
it
wonderful
flavor
i
like
that
green
use
mixed
green
instead
of
iceberg
lettuce
it
may
take
away
the
crunchiness
but
i
like
the
taste
much
better
green
also
go
light
on
the
mayo
which
i
appreciate
the
thyme
fire
be
really
good
they
are
thin
and
crispy
and
the
herb
really
enhance
the
flavor
they
give
you
a
lot
of
fry
which
make
up
for
the
sandwich
be
a
little
undersized
but
i
would
rather
have
more
sandwich
than
fry
since
heaven
forbid
i
be
strong
enough
to
pass
up
on
sweet
i
also
try
a
peanut
butter
chocolate
bar
not
bad
but
certainly
not
worth
it
ask
price
it
remind
me
of
a
storebought
peanut
butter
rice

recommend

this

a

it
good

great

the

of
the
time

get

big
wac

prediction

you
blindfold
an
animal
eater

they
take
a
bite
out
of
a
big
wac

not

it
be
not
animal

would
comment
on
how
it
be
the
best
big

they
have
ever
have
the
only
reason
i
give
it
star

not

the
order

could
really
be
improve

only

a
well

there
be
not
menus
before
you
get

slow
thing
down

it
a
shot

year
later

can
say
this
be
one
of
my
favorite

how
that
happen
sometimes

review
too
much

once
i
try

i
have
be
loyal
to
it

the
vegan
burger
be
so
incredible

probably
the
closest
tasting
to
real
meat

you
can

occasionally
switch
up
my

all
leave

some
of
my

share
many
time
over

again
i
purposely

not

this

be
from
my
eye
a
a

and
i
come
here
last
night

head

first
think

in
the
wrong
the

a
small

a
well
a

a
small

it

an
older

the
restaurant
be
off
to
the
far
right
side
of
the
store
in
fact
the
restaurant
seem
like
an
afterthought
there
be
very
old
table
and
chair
with
the
cheapest
silverware
napkin
plate
and
glass
that
the
restaurant
supply
store
carry
there
be
no
personality
to
this
part
of
the
store
at
all
and
while
that
be
not
entirely
a
bad
thing
because
i
am
not
afraid
to
visit
a
dive
restaurant
in
the
case
of
hajibaba
this
be
just
a
sign
of
thing
to
come
despite
be
severely
overdress
we
be
seat
at
a
nearby
table
by
a
polite
man
who
come
across
like
one
of
the
owner
unfortunately
he
be
not
our

our
server
be
a
man
who
be
barely
audible
when
he
do
speak
to
which
be
nominal
at
best
which
be
to
say
that
he
say
just
enough
to
get
our
order
and
then
never
come
back
again
our
dinner
come
out
in
le
than
minuteswhich
seem
very
surprising
to
me
although
our
dish
be
not
complex
nor
be
the
menu
a
there
be
limited
selection
at
hajibaba
i
think
that
there
might
be
a
little
more
effort
especially
now
that
i
have
read
so
many
other
review
on
this
place
the
food
be
clearly
premade
and
just
scoop
on
the
plate
i
guess
that
ok

maybe
i
am
spoiled

the

itself

he

it

nothing

i

i
have

the

be
creamy

kind

bland

the

be
warm

flavorful
when
we
get
more
our
first

the
point

soggy
the
tabouli
be
nice

with
just
the
right
amount
of
crunch
overall
this
would
have
be
a
star
review
if
not
for
the
lackluster
service
we
receive
our
server
have
zero
personality
he
never
come
back
to
check
on

he
stop
at
several
table
near
to
give
them
a
thumb
up
to
check
on
them
so
maybe
it
be
just
and
the
fact
that
we
be
dress
up
that
put
him
off
i
think
initially
that
he

not

comfortable

stem
from
those
who
do
not
know
what
real
middle

taste

the

the

you
can
buy
at
any

not

the

not

you

obviously

be
right
by

nearentirety

be
in

to
the
right

for
two

where
the

me
even
though
there
be
open
table
of
equal
size
in

this
be
a
little
odd
be
i
be
sequester
for
some
reason
i
do
not
think
i
look
disheveled

what
do
i
know
anyway

order
some
baba
ganoush
with
pita

appetizer

then
the
chicken
shawarma
combination
plate
for
entree

will
agree
about
the
price
they
do
seem
very
reasonable
the
combination
plate
be
something
also
they
have
choice
of
either
arabicstyle
or
persianstyle
kabob

i
pretty
much
never
see
in

tall
frost
plastic
cup
full

though
that
the
cup
be
so
tall
that
my
accompany
straw
completely
disappear

soon

i
drop
it
in
oh
well
my
baba
ganush
arrive

it
look
really
great
however
the
taste
be
so
mild
that
you
could
barely
distinguish
it
from
hummus
you
would
have
no
inkling
whatsoever
that
this
be
eggplant
mush
it
have
none
of
the
smoky
slightly
bitter
flavor
that
baba
ganush
be
know
for
which
be
fine
maybe
milder
meeker
le
potentially
offensive
flavor
be
the
way
to
go
in
a
college
setting
but
i
be
a
little
disappointed
then
come
my
chicken
shawarma
entree
which
have
a
sizeable
pile
of
the
aforementioned
chicken
plus
hummus
tabbouleh
rice
and
more
pita

could
see
how
a
a
college
student
that
this
would
be
a
great
value
even
a
a
working
professional
this
be
still
good
value
in
front
of
me
be
a
lot
of
food
for
not
much
money
they
be
generous
with
the
amount
of
chicken
they
give
a
rare
sight
in
many
of
these
restaurant
but
again
hop
for
amazing
thing
i
be
underwhelmed
by
the
taste
of
each
of
the
element
not
that
any
of
the
item
taste
bad
but
that
their
flavor
be
more
mute
than
other
middle
eastern
establishment

have
be
to
in

i

now

more
than

handful

figure
it
out

by

reason

be
due

almost
ridiculously

the
best

cut
their

meat
off

in
my
experience

hover
around
mediocrity
this
place
be
on
the
cusp
of
greatness

be
hold
back
with
weak
support
dish
when
i
come
here
i
normally
get
the
sultani
or
the
mixed
kabob
plate
while
the
meat
be
tender
moist
and
grill
to
perfection
it
be
complement
by
subpar
basmati
rice
or
hummus
that
taste
like
it
come
straight
from
a
can
the
tabbouleh
be
ok
though
their
appetizer
be
also
on
the
wrong
side
of
mediocrity
in
addition
to
the
gastronomic
catastrophe
that
they
call
hummus
their
sambusek
and
fuul
be
also
thoroughly
unimpressive
i
have
live
in
egypt
so
i
know
what
good
fuul
taste
like
and
trust
me
that
be
not

it

it
come
straight
from

let
end

positive
note

the
meat
be
succulent

by
in

the

reasonably

service
be
prompt

friendly

if
you
need
halal
meat

say
that
i
be
somewhat
disappointed
not
too
much

a
little
it
be
ridiculously
inexpensive

for
the

the
food
be
decent

with
the

to
the

the

tabouli

very
good
although
i
do
not
much
care
for
tabouli
in
general
or
rice
so
i
am
not
sure
why
i
order
the
plate
instead
of
the
sandwich
maybe
i
just
want
to
see
more
food
on
my
plate
that
sound
like
me
the
flavor
of
the
shawarma
be
good

i
be
really
disappointed
in
the
chicken
it
be
everything
from
larger
chunk
of
meat
to
itty
bitty
little
scrap
mostly
scrap
but
again
dirt
cheap
so
you
can
only
complain
so
much
we
also
browse
in
the
grocery
part
and
pick
up
some
package
goody
and
piece
of
baklava
probably
some
of
the
best
baklava
i
have
have
they
be
out
of
the
pecan
variety
but
there
be
also
almond
pistachio
and
cashew
to
choose
from
it
be
something
crazy
like
a
buck
a
piece

i
am
glad
we
go

i
would
go
again

i
do
not
know
i
would
go
out

can
almost
hear

of
operational
efficiency
in
how
this

it

so
popular

take
my
workteam
to
lunch
here
today

honestly
no
detail

i
have
no
doubt
that
in
go
here
folk
will
have
a
consistently
positive

for

with

to
be
good

nothing
at
least
this
time
send
me
into
foodie
heaven
i
get
the
fry
chicken

while
it
be
good
a
bit
sweet
for
me
for
some
reason
part
of
the
reason
may
be
that
i
have
the
asian
fusion
style
fry
chicken
from
welcome
chicken
donuts
the
day
before

it

a
bit
by
comparison
probably
the
big
thing
the
mash
potato
come
across
a
a
bit
too
smooth
something
like
mash
new
potato
do
a
bit
thicker
would
be
a
bit
more
in
alignment
with
the
sort
of
stomach
grab
mash
potato
that
complement
fry
chicken
same
for
the
gravy
feel
a
bit
too
smooth
out
versus
say
a
thicker
gravy
with
a
stronger
component
of
black
pepper

will
say
that
the
sweet
potato
cannelloni

be
well
receive

it

one
of

be
pretty
full

this
may
have
contribute

it

really
could
not

myself

nope
nope

lesson

grinder

in

honesty
none

them
really
catch
my

be
how
i

know
maybe
next
time

my
mind

work
up
the
courage
to
give
some
of
the
other
entrees
a
shot

i

out
the
location
in

very
mixed

it

you
can
be
a
little
nicer
about
it

for
people
to
give
her
a
hard
time
she
end
up
leave
immediately

she
could
not
stay
with
the
dog
the
drink
be
very
expensive
to
for
their
underwhelming
and
small
cocktail
tasty

expensive

some
sangria

it

a
glass

there

a

bottom
line
ensure
that
the

know
when
to
stop
be
too
friendly

talkative
because
they
can
eventually
get
so
distract
in
the
conversation
that
they
might
forget
which
card
be
whose

charge
you
the

delicious

if
gorgonzola

the
first
word

three

gorgonzola

never

she
offer
to
speak
with
her
night
staff
that
come
in
later
in

anything

she
ask
if
there

could
do
short
of
pay
to
have
the

fix
what
exactly
be
she
offer
so
we
ask
for
a
refund
of
the
amount
spend
at
the
restaurant
to
offset
the
thousand
in
repair
and
she
seem
surprised
we
even
suggest
it
she
say
it
be
the
first
she
be

about
any
bad
service
that
not
the
point
we
do
not
complain
about
the
restaurant
itself
but
the
destruction
of
our
property
and
since
she
ask
what
she
could
do
we
take
her
up
on
it
no
dice
she
then
point
out
that
this
happen
all
the
time
a
if
we
be
not
the
only
unfortunate
customer
we
then
get
a
call
from
erica

regional
operation

who
not
only
offer
the
refund

how
expensive
the
repair
would
be

also
be
way
more
interested
than
alyssa
the
gm
look
into
what
happen
she
also
inform
that
security
have
zero
say
when
a
customer
be
cut
off
it
strictly
up
to
manager
and
bartender
neither
of
which
come
to
our

even
serve
my
daughter
another
drink
immediately
after
be
cut
off
she
also
seem
very
surprised
to

that
this
be
a
common
occurrence

it

not

be
here

not

generally
really
good

this
review
be
mostly
in
regard
to
togo
order
this
be
the
nd
time
i
have
order
the
food
to
go
during
my
lunch

my
order
have
be
completely
wrong
when
i
get
it
back
to
work
today
i
order
a
chicken
ceasar
salad
i
be
ask
if
i
want
it
mixed
together
and
i
say
sure
so
i
get
my
order
get
it
back
to
my
office
and
it
a
salad
in
one
box
dress
on
the
side
and
a
full
unsliced
chicken
breast
in
another
box
okaaay
maybe
mixed
do
not
mean
what
i
think
it
meantoh
well
so
i
pour
the
dressing
on
the
salad
and
it
ranch
not
ceasar
not
a
huge
dealjust
not
what
i
order
so
then
i
go
to
cut
up
the
chicken
breast
and
it
be
definitely
slather
in
spaghetti
sauce
so
now
i
have
a
ranch
salad

a
spaghetti
sauce
cover
chicken
breast
awkward

my
lunch
hour
be
almost
over

i
be
starve
i
decide
finei
will
just
eat
them
separately
and
call
it
a
meal
both
be
awful
the
chicken
taste
like
it
have
be
reheat
and
the
salad
be
wilt
this
be
a
bummer

their
food
be
good
every
time
i
eat
there
so
it
may
just
be
a
takeout
issue

for
that
reason
i
recommend
eat
there
no
takeout

nearly

i
have
a
bad

here

there

a
large
piece

glass
in
my
cup

i
have
tell
the
manager

my
server
both
of
which
do
nothing
after
about
minute
i
keep
tell
him
it
be
an
issue
and
they
finally
bring
their
attention
to
see
if
they
could
help
me
with
my
situation
i
could
have
choke
in
this
piece
of
glass
and
that
could
have
cause
a
really
big
problem
the
food
be
pretty
good
however
due
to
the
fact
that
the
service
be
so
negligent
impassive
i
do
not
think
i
will
ever
come
back

my
last
review

probably

here

the

always
top
notch

i
have
to
say
since
the
recent
expansion
the
service
have
really
suffer
on
each

my
last

take
over
an
hour

get
my
food

be
patient

when
the
food
be
so
delicious

the
lack
of
concern
from
the
server
be
a
bit
much
last

come
in

order
the
tikka

know
they
may
be
busy

over
an
hour
for
a

pretty
poor

time
before

i
be
serve

cold

you
could
tell
it
have
sit
for
quite
a
while

make
it
to
my

point
these

out

blank

a
passive

are
work
on
it

think
i
will
wait
a
couple
of
month

they
work
out
the
kink
in
their

the

sound

over
the
idea
of
a
gourmet
hot

never

it
out

maybe
a
year
ago

by
another

i
would
just
give
it
a
shot

delightful

dark

people
dig
that
nowadays

main
reason

bring
the

out

thrill

come
back
after
a
couple
minute
with
the

be
hop
the

would
come
out
shortly
after

love
bread

when
we
run
out
of
bread
mean
after
i
scarf
all
the
bread
down
i
patiently
wait
for
our

to
come
back
around
so
i
could
ask
for
more
bread
a
well
a
the
status
on
our
salad
remember
when
i
say
i
be
starve
well
i
start
to
get
a
little
cranky
when
i
am
hungry

our

be
not
make
any
round
to
see
how
her
table
be
do
after
fifteen
or
so
minute
i
decide
to
go
over
to
where
our
server
be
talk
with
another
server
and
ask
for
more
bread
nicely
of
course
once
she
come
back
with
our
bread
the
soup
be
cold
but
i
do
not
really
mind
i
be
just
happy
she
put
more
bread
in
front
of
me
a
few
minute
later
our
pasty
come
out
she
have
obviously
forget
about
our
salad
guess
that
what
happen
when
you
do
not
write
anything
down
so
i
remind
her
and
she
come
back
shortly
with
it
only
after
we
have
be
sit
there
for
ten
minute
after
we
have
finish
everything
and
the
busser
who
be
much
friendly
than
our
server
have
already
clear
the
table
do
our
server
appear
from
the
darkness

we
be
finally
able
to
get
our
check
pay
and
leave

am
use
to
the
service
be
not
so
great
but
this
be
just
awful

think
maybe
if
i
write
a
review
about
my
last
experience
they
would
change
the
service
up
or
hire
better
server
serve
itself
be
not
very
hard
i
know
i
have
do
it
and
it
do
not
take
much
effort
to
check
up
on
a
table
but
the
people
who
work
at
the
pasty
just
do
not
seem
to
care
about
anything
i
guess
that
just
a
hipster
thing

would
love
to
see
their
interview
process
if
there
even
be
one
do
you
know
how
to
carry
food
yes
okay
you
are
hire
anyway
i
think
i
will
be
drive
out
of
the
way
to
go
to
the
other
pasty
instead
since
their
server
be
a
little
more
attentive
and
i
can
actually
see
who
i
am
eat
with
and
what
i
am
eat
for

come
on

better
yet

wear

my

be
allow

go
anywhere

fully

what

again
to
give
them
another
try
when
we
be
in
town
]
[
if
you
have
have
real
british
food
then
you
would
probably
think
this
place
be
on
par
with
your
previous
experience
i
think
the
concept
be
cool
the
food
be
ok
but
somewhat
uninspiring
but
then
again
this
be
british
food
not
a
knock
just
the
truth
i
try
the
turkey
pasty
and
salmon
pasty
a
for
taste
i
definitely
give
the
edge
to
the
salmon
for
dessert
i
try
the
strawberry
palova
it
be
good
but
very
rich
so
i
could
only
a
eat
half
of
it
the
best
thing
about
this
place
be
that
it
very
affordable
for
those
who
eat
on
a
budget
we
have
two
pasty
dessert
glass
of
wine
and
a
sprite
for
le
than
if
you
have
never
be
i
definitely
recommend
check
out
this
place

[
i
have
now
eat
at
both
the
mesa
and
the
tempe
location
of
this
company
this
review
be
only
valid
for
the
tempe
location
several
companion
and
i
visit
the
tempe
location
for
dinner
the
food
be
very
similar
to
the
food
prepped
at
the
mesa
location
but
that
be
where
the
similarity
end
compare
to
the
mesa
location
the
tempe
one
be
both
a
lot
smaller
and
darker
i
felt
like
i
be
go
into
a
dungeon
since
our
table
be
in
a
dark
corner
all
the
way
in
the
back
our
food
be
good
but
the
lack
of
sanitation
be
very
apparent
our
utensil
be
dirty
and
have
to
be
replace
and
then
the
replacement
be
find
to
be
dirty
and
have
to
be
replace
this
be
not
a
good
sign

use
a
good
vacuuming

all
sort

item
from
piece
of
food

piece

even
a
cigarette
butt
i
am
not
sure
how
a
cigarette
butt
get
on
the
floor
since
no
restaurant
allow
smoke
anymore
but
there
it
be
say
hello
to
service
be
much
slower
than
the
mesa
location
and
our
server
have
a
laissezfaire
attitude
that
do
not
speak
well
for
them
they
be
more
interested
in
chat
with
other
server
than
wait
on
our
table
i
have
give
the
three
star
only
because
the
food
be
the
same
tasty
dish
that
be
serve
in

a
far
a

the

i
saw
work
tonight
look
lazy

tired
maybe
due
to
the
high
temperature
of
the

with
poor

lack
of
a

in

greet
me
with
a

a

me

not
want
my
money

you
do
not
care
enough
about
your

stand
around
eventually
the
attitude
of
we
have
a
superior
product
that
ppl
pay
for
and
they
not
have
to
worry
about
customer
service
will
come
back
to
bite
them
in
the

the

be
about

all
the

be
a
dump

run
down

kind
of
dirty

off
a
dirty

see
the

it
clean

there
hello
you
be
practically
in
my
lap

party
should
have
get
a
whole

happy

have
the
toffee
pudding
with

enjoyable

wandering

a
shock

the
sens
i
be
momentarily
blind

of
how
dark
and
dimly
light
the

be
after
take
a
minute

my
eye
to
adjust

saw
a
couple
empty
table
and
two
waitstaff
i
do
not
know
this
be
a
seat
yourself
kind
of
deal
so
my
brother
and
i
just
stand
at
the
doorway
and
wait
for
instruction
after
about
minute
or
so
a
waitress
tell
to
seat
ourselves
we
come
around
pm
so
many
of
the
vegan
pasty
have
be
sell
out
and
i
be
leave
with
the
choice
between
the
vindaloo
and
the
greek
flavored
one
upon
the
waitress
recommendation
i
go
with
the
vindaloo
my
brother
and
i
also
order
the
ovenbaked
chip
to
share
the
vindaloo
pasty
be
spicy
and
filling
but
probably
not
something
i
would
order
again
the
vindaloo
fill
do
not
offer
much
excitement
in
the
flavor
department
and
eat
that
much
vindaloo
fill
be
kind
of
monotonous

really
wish
i
come
earlier
so
i
could
have
more
vegan
option
to
choose
from
but
my
mistake
be
your
benefit
the
pastry
part
of
the
pasty
be
delicious
it
be
crunchy
and
have
a
wonderful
pastry
flavor
that
be
hard
to
describe
if
they
sell
a
pasty
full
of
the
pastry
i
would
buy
that
in
a
heartbeat
when
compare
my
pasty
to
my
brother
i
could
tell
they
do
not
glaze
mine
which
be
a
comforting
to
see
because
they
probably
use
an
egg
wash
the
ovenbaked
chip
be
they
be
crunchy
crispy
and
satisfy
you
ca
not
go
wrong
with
fresh
bake
frieschips

would
visit
again

earlier

look
through
all

expect
the

to
taste
extraordinary

have
the
chicken
tikka
masala

i
expect
to
have
more
curry
sauce
but
it
be
dry
the
yogurt
sauce
complement
the
pasty
since
it
give
a
cool
taste
to
the
dish
this
pasty
be
worth
a
try
if
you
be
look
for
something
interesting
my
fiancee
have
the
oogie
which
taste
dry
and
have
scarce
amount
of
steak
chunk
if
anything
there
be
more
potato
chunk
than
steak
chunk
the
sauce
that
come
with
the
oogie
do
not
taste
good
and
make
me
want
to
throw
up
because
it
be
a
wine
gravy
sauce
that
taste
like
expire
sauce
i
definitely
do
not
recommend
the
oogie
warning
the
pasty
take
about
minute
to
order
so
do
not
come
here
hungry

expect
to
get
your
pasty
right
away

do
want

j
beer
list
be
good
and
the
wine
and
liquor
be
decent
this
place
get
pretty
hoppin
but
there
be
not
that
long
of
a
wait
on
busy
night
i
love
get
their
roast
potato
on
the
side
and
they
be
incredibly
veganvegetarian
friendly
however
no
substitution
can
be
make
a
those
be
premade
and
frozen
which
be
part
of
why
they
only
get
star
the
food
be
more
of
a
but
their
tempe
asu
clientele
can
be
a
little
on
the
annoyingloud
side
so
i
take
off
star
for
lack
of
atmosphere
this
location
be
also
quite
small
but
they
do
takeout
and
be
open
late

[
i
really
just
want
to
point
out
my
experience
to
the
manager
a
i
do
not
feel
you
deserve
a
bad
review
for
this
but
with
two
separate
door
and
a
very
unique
layout
you
must
know
it
a
confusing
restaurant
and
there
be
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
that
however
that
should
be
a
focus
for
your
employee
realize
that
every
guest
should
be
greet
and
either
tell
where
to
sit
or
to
seat
themselves
i
awkwardly
walk
into
both
entry
and
neither
time
do
a
single
employee
say
hello
or
even
look
my
way
forget
to
mention
that
prior
to
arrive
i
call
in
to
check
that
there
be
not
a
cover
for
the
fight
most
bar
be
charge
if
they
have
the
fight
on
and
the
girl
that
answer
be
extremely
rude
customer
service
be
so
simple
it
pain
me
when
employee
be
so
bad
at
basic
people
skill
it
be
hard
to
convince
my
boyfriend
to
even
give
it
a
shot
after
speak
to
her
so
after
this
and
the
lack
of
acknowledgment
when
i
walk
in
i
could
not
do
it
i
leave
and
very
disappointed
because
i
truly
want
to
give
this
place
a
shot
maybe
i
will
attempt
another
location
one
day

lamb
pea
carrot
grill
onion

a

well
worth
the
trip
down
to

the
gravy
be
definitely
necessary

without
it
it
would
have
be
a
bit
dry
i
try
to
order
the
french
fry

be
tell
they
do
not
have
any
left
despite
it
be
only
pm
on
a
saturday
night
the
reason
for
my
starstringiness
have
to
do
with
the
level
of
service
we
have
people
and
when
we
walk
in
they
be
pretty
busy
there
be
a
table
in
the
back
that
just
need
to
be
clean
off
a
waitress
come
up
and
tell
to
wait
there
for
a
minute

she
clean
it
off
about
second
later
a
waiter
come
up
and
tell
not
to
stand
by
the
front

to
go
stand
by
the
table
we
walk
back
by
the
table

then
get
yell
at
by
the
waitress
for
not
listen
to
her
from
that
point
on
she
seem
pretty
piss
off
at
it

to
the
point
that
i
felt
uncomfortable
even
just
ask
her
for
a
cup
of
water

the
unfriendly
server

will
definitely
go
back

another

to
this

about
time

to
this
location
to
tonight
for
the
first
time
in
probably
a
year
or
two

the
service
be
so
awful
i
felt
the
need
to
share
i
hate
to
do
it
because
the
food
really
be
good
and
they
have
a
solid
beer
selection
and
decent
price

this
be
the
worst
service
i
can
remember
in
year
of
eat
out
service
here
have
never
be
great
but
this
be
the
worst
i
have
see
it
and
compare
to
most
other
place
around
tempe
that
have
excellent
service
it
be
pretty
abysmal
it
be
only
slightly
busy
when
we
get
there
most
table
be
take
but
usually
only
people
at
a
person

we
have
a
medium
size
group

and
be
able
to
find
a
table
outside

probably
minute
before
anyone
come
by
the
table
have
not
be
clear
from
the
people
before

fortunately
there
be
already
a
beer
menu
there
server
do
not
clear
or
wipe
down
the
table
at
all
just
ask
for
our
order
the
menu
have
like
rotate
beer
ask
our
server
what
they
be
rather
than
just
tell
what
the
be
he
make
ask
individually
they
be
categorize
seasonal

he
end
up

to
list
off
almost
all
of
them
anyway
we
order
of
them

this
be
the
first
indication
that
thing
would
be
difficult

food
come
out
relatively
quick
no
real
issue
here

only
half
of
be

be
not
terrible

helpful

when
answer
question

have
to

at
all
everything

bare
minimum
effort

it
be
not
because
it
be
busy
the
big
problem
come
when
the
check
come
first
they
pretty
much
run
off
no
one
ask
for
the
check
it
be
at
a
place
that
close
at
and
the
place
be
basically
empty

he
just
dump
the
check
without
say
anything
put
everything
on
one
check
when
the
group
be
clearly
individual

then
pretty
much
refuse
to
split
it
different
people
ask
tell
we
could
tell
him
amount
and
he
would
charge
them
he
have
charge
for
one
item
we
order
but
they
do
not
have
i
let
him
know
and
he
say
he
would
remove
we
do
the
math
give
him
card
and
check
and
he
bring
it
back
tell
pretty
rudely
we
be
short
of
that
be
his
failure
to
remove
the
item
he
bill
for

have
just
say
he
would

in
the

have
to
ask
him
twice
to

just
apologize

give
me
grief

buddy
nothing
to
get
mad
about
at
this

minute

at

pretty

ever
have
this

difficulty

honestly
would
have
save
himself
a
lot
of
work

hassle

he
just
split
it
from
the
beginning
and
not
fight
about
it
every
step
of
the
way

generally
recommend
the
pasty

will
avoid
this
location
like
plague
from
now
on

come
here
since
the
location
be
essentially
a
hallway

not
anymore

some
great
johnny
cash
waylon
and
neil
young
over
the
restaurant
speaker
i
also
hear
a
woman
at
a
nearby
table
say
that
be
the
most
disgusting
bathroom
i
have
ever
see
in
a
restaurant
i
want
to
just
sip
and
chill
for
awhile
after
dinner
and
i
joke
with
two
server
that
they
should
now
switch
and
play
lead
zeppelin
second
later
two
thing
happen
the
country
music
playing
be
increase
dramaticlly
in
volume

be
amuse

i
do
that

i
now

cold
air
condition
blow
on
the
back

my
neck
i
be
le
amused

it
be
pm
and
prior
to
this
the
heat
have
be
on
all
night

it
be
january

now

my
hoodie
on
over
my
head
a
the
ac
pour
down
upon
me
for
the
next
minute

exit
wonder
which
hamfisted
manager
make
such
decision
and
why

start
patronize
this
cornish
pasty
location
when
they
be
just
a
hallway
and
a
kitchen
the
place
be
awesome
with
food
you
could
not
get
anywhere
else
in
town
and
a
great
selection
of
craft
beer
it
be
fun
to
sit
at
the
counter
and
watch
them
make
the
pasty
i
wish
that
i
would
review
the
place
previously
a
i
would
have
give
them
star
over
probably
a
dozen
previous
visit

i
be
not
really
a
yelper
then
now
the
place
have
expand
significantly
and
it
appear
business
volume
have
keep
up
with
this
expansion
which
mean
they
be
almost
certainly
profitable
and
that
what
make
my
last
visit
so
hard
to
understand
first
our
table
in
the
back
corner
of
the
dining
room
the
glass
surface
be
break
from
what
be
likely
a
few
too
many
full
plate
and
empty
pint
be
forcefully
put
down
on
it
and
it
appear
a
if
many
a
beer
have
be
spill
on
that
section
of
the
table
because
the
metal
latticework
under
the
cracked
section
of
glass
be
a
mysterious
dull
brown
moldymildwey
color
for
a
good
to
each
side
of
the
glass
but
the
light
be
dim
and
it
do
not
smell
so
we
decide
to
ignore
it
second
the
men
room
i
step
in
here
after
we
order
but
before
our
food
be
deliver
this
be
one
of
the
most
disgusting
restaurant
men
room
i
have
ever

colder

three
of

the

next
day

one
of

i
realize
this

decide
my

i
would
meet
up
here

drink
on
this
particular
night
the
resturant

like
usual
my
friend

i
saw
two
open
seat
at
the
bar

sit
down
about
minute
later
the
waitress
tell
she
would
be
with
shortly
when
we
hit
the
minute
mark
i
be
nothing
but
enrage
at
the
terrible
customer
service
i
tell
my
friend
that
i
want
to
go
somewhere
else
a
i
be
get
up
and
gather
my
purse
the
waitress
come
over
and
have
the
ball
to
tell
she
be
just
about
to
take
our
order
i
inform
her
that
we
be
leave
because
she
take
minute
to
get
to
she
should
have
just
let
leave
and
not
say
anything
the
fact
she
even
acknowledge
she
be
a
crappy

me
more

why
the
three
star
when
you
are
not
wait
forever
for
service

you
actually
get
the

eat
their
pasty
your
mind
will
be
blow
the
food
be

the
only
downside
be
you
do
not
want
to
show

nonseafood
item
for
people
like
me
service
can
be
spotty
my
last
visit
however
really
change
my
perspective
on
this
place
i
would
have
rat
this
place
star
but
they
fail
in
a
couple
of
key
area
it
take
over
one
and
a
half
hour
for
to
get
our
entree
we
do
get
appetizer
and
soupsalad
for
those
who
order
them
but
the
gap
between
those
and
the
entree
be
noticeably
long
i
understood
that
since
we
be
a
somewhat
large
party
that
it
may
take
longer
but
still
that
long
i
be
start
to
wonder
if
they
just
want
to
keep
the
alcohol
flowing
and
that
we
would
not
notice
how
long
the
actual
food
take
when
i
finally
get
my
turkey
croissant
sandwich
there
be
very
little
turkey
a
in
thin
slice
and
i
could
not
detect
the
avocado
lettuce
or
tomato
i
could
definitely
taste
the
bacon
though
since
there
seem
to
be
more
bacon
than
anything
else
the
balance
of
the
whole
sandwich
be
lose
everyone
else
be
happy
with
their
food
at
least
the
server
acknowledge
at
the
end
that
it
take
a
while
and
comped
a
few
item
since
it
be
a
large
party
they
include
the
tip
in
the
bill
despite
the
somewhat
crappy
service
since
people
be
more
interested
in
the
movie
afterwards
i
be
not
go
to
contest
that
i
will
reluctantly
come
here
again

be
why
i
rate
it
two

this
be
not
a

near
the
top

my

dinner
but
they
would
not
seat
until
everyone
arrive
so
that
be
kinda
ruin
it
be
a
monday
night
so
they
place
be
not
busy
somehow
from
wait
to
be
seat
and
finally
leave
after
the
bill
we
be
there
for
hour
they
get
three
star
because
they
have
fry
pickle
and
they
are
spear
not
slice
win
i
do
have
leftover
for
day
and
they
have
tootsie
pop
on
they
way
out
not
a
total
loss
pretty
pricey
for
the
quality
though

we
have
hear
of
the
lucille
in
vega
they
rave
about
it
so
we
decide
to
give
it
a
try
at
tempe
marketplace
we
drive
minute
down
from
north
phoenix
find
the
ambiance
to
be
cluttered
but
probably
one
of
this
chain
trademark
you
could
tell
that
some
light
shade
have
probably
be
break
and
they
have
be
substitute
for
something
else
carpet

clean
our
booth
be
clean
and
comfortable
we
be
seat
right
away
but
have
to
wait
to
get
someone
to
take
our
drink
order
which
be
not
our
server
what
they
do
be
go
into
the
kitchen
to
tell
the
server
assign
to
our
table
they
have
a
table
that
when
our
server
come
out
and
we
give
our
drink
order
a
second
time
after
we
get
our
drink
the
server
say
that
they
would
be
right
back
with
the
biscuit
which
be
the
quickest
thing
do
re
the
whole
dining
experience
we
give
our
dinner
order
when
the
biscuit
be
bring
out
for
an
appetizer
we
order
the
onion
string
which
be
basic
onion
string

dinner
partner
order
the
beef
tip
sandwich
w
mash

keep
the
sandwich
a
be

have
new
potato

out
these

that
the
food
have
be
sit
on
the
rack
wait
to
be
serve
my
dinner
partner
make
the
comment
that
the
sandwich
would
have
be
good
if
it
have
be
hot
i
order
the
cajun
chicken
sandwich
with
the
peanut
coleslaw
my
sandwich
be
hot
problem
be
that
chicken
be
cook
so
that
it
be
tough
tough
to
take
a
bite
tough
to
chew
and
tough
to
cut
with
the
steak
knife
make
we
wonder
about
the
quality
of
the
meat

him
about
the
fried

he
apparently
never

always
order
the
hickory

the
description

i

my
selection

waiter

out
complimentary
buttermilk
roll

cinnamon
butter
okay
he
say
complimentary
roll
but
it
be
a
singular
roll
it
be
a
little
hard
but
edible
taste

something
you
would
get
from
the
kfc
drive
thru

take
several

the

coke

i
never

i
be
there

the
first
thing
i
notice
be
the

take
me
back
to
when
i
good

iceberg
lettuce

cherry

that
what
it
be
plus
some
carrot
shaving

crouton
after
see
the
purple
cabbage
i
believe
it
be
the
prepackaged
salad
in
a
bag
from
the
grocery
inspire
by
the
ranch
dress

the

it

very
runny
i

from
be
the
final
remnant
of
the
original
bottle
of
dress
and
they
add
water
to
extend
the
number
of
serving
very
blah
and
plain
another
interesting
item
on
the
plate
be
the
small
watermelon
wedge
wtf
the
baked
potato
definitely
be
not
champ
it
be
dry
which
okay
i
get
that
i
can
pick
my
sauce
for
the
topping
i
choose
the
dark
bbq
sauce
it
be
good
sweet
and
molassessy
be
that
a
word
i
take
the
pulled
pork
version
of
the
potato
and
it
include
sour
cream
cheese
scallion
and
be
just
okay
for
me
i
eat
it
but
i
will
continue
my
search
for
a
good
local
bbq
place
another
thing
i
would
not
recommend
be
go
there

you
be
on
a
typical
work
lunch

mention
it
be

there

a

when
the

bring
out
he
ask

it

okay

i
do
not
see
him
again
until
i
be
finish
and
impatiently
wait
on
the
check
several
minute
after
be
finish
the
price
for
the
potato
be
probably
a
touch
too
high
for
what
you
receive
there
be
not
that
much
meat
on
the
potato
the
coke
be
also
so
maybe
water
would
be
a
better
choice
slow

higher
price

just

a
better

this
past
friday
we
go
again
it
be
very
busy
inside
and
out
again
the
service
be
lack
we
wait
quite
a
while
for
our
appetizer

never
come
finally
our
food
come
out

to
get
our

to
stop
for
more
than
a
second
be
nearly
impossible
when
she
check
on
when
our
food
come
it
be
more
of
a
walk
by
glance
eventually
the
next
time
she
walk
by
about
a
third
of
the
way
through
my
food
we
stop
her
long
enough
to
say
we
never
get
our
appetizer
she
ask
if
i
still
want
it
i
say
yes
she
say
the
kitchen
forget
it
but
i
know
that
server
language
for
i
never
ring
it
in
and
be
pass
the
responsibility
off
onto
the
kitchen
it
be
busy

be
understanding
maybe
both
visit

just
get
server
on
off
night

next
time
around
we
will
get
better

get
carne
asada
taco

only
dislike
be
they
have
corn
tortilla
which
i
prefer
the
le
authentic
flour
tortilla
just
a
flavor
and
texture
thing

the
meat
and
cheese
and
other
topping
be
star
the
pizza
do
not
know
the
name
but
it
have
different
meat
on
it
pepperoni
sausage
i
think
i
ham
it
be
good
not
the
best
pizza
ever
but
still
delicious

again
the
edamame

be
what
be

something

option
for

the

[
hmmm
i
have
some
mixed
feeling
about
casey
moore
the
place
be
always
pack
so
it
definitely
a
popular
spot
i
use
to
come
here
all
the
time
back
in
the
college
day
this
time
i
come
here
on
a
busy
weekend
night
around
pm
for
dinner
and
drink
there
be
not
really
a
system
for
get
any
kind
of
table
so
you
have
to
fend
for
yourself
we
be
able
to
get
a
spot
but
wait
for
a
waitress
to
come
take
a
while
like
i
say
it
be
busy
but
maybe
they
just
need
more
staff
or
something
once
we
have
our
server
everything
be
great
we
ok
maybe
just
i
order
way
too
much
food
i
get
the
scampi
shrimp
boat
a
dozen
oyster
and
escargot
you
get
a
ton
of
escargot
not
just
the
six
that
you
normally
get
in
the
dish
the
size
of
the
shrimp
boat
be
generous
a
well
everything
be
perfectly
cook
and
the
garlic
bread
be
awesome
for
dip
in
the
extra
garlic
butter
the
oyster
be
just
ok
i
feel
like
a
place
that
have
oyster
in
the
name
should
have
an
actual
selection
of
different
oyster
and
they
should
be
serve
detach
from
the
shell
they
do
not
have
a
ton
of
flavor
either
so
that
be
a
bummer
we
order
oyster
shooter
a
well
which
be
a
huge
mistake
i
do
not
know
what
i
be
expect
but
the
giant
oyster
mix
of
tomato
juice
and
the
world
cheapest
vodka
be
not
pleasant
at
all
casey
moore
definitely
caters
to
the
college
drinking
crowd
especially
on
the
weekend
so
i
would
recommend
if
you
are
come
in
for
dinner
to
do
it
on
a
quieter
night
where
there
hopefully
a
bit
more
organization
also
if
you
have
an
aversion
to
cigarette
smoke
the
patio
be
not
for
you
everyone
around

smoke

for

unpleasant

around

around

my
empty
giant
mason

on

he
need
to
get
a

once
we
deliberately
close
out

[
this
review
be
long
overdue
my
husband
and
i
have
live
in
tempe
for
almost
year
and
finally
make
it
to
casey
moore
after
some
friend
simply
could
not
believe
we
have
never
be
there
before
so
we
decide
to
make
a
stop
after
an
afternoon
at
the
phoenix
art
museum
for
some
bloody
mary
hangover

on
valentine

expect
the
usual
mill
ave
college
crowd
mixed
together
with
hipster
hippy
and
pseudo
intellectual
and
i
be
not
disappointed
we
find
a
seat
at
a
sticky
dirty
table
next
to
the
little
fish
pond
and
have
a
lovely
time
watch
the
bird
fight
over
forlorn
french
fry
strew
under
empty
table
i
be
over
the
people
watch
if
you
are
in
tempe
that
mean
you
are
look
at
half
dress
year
old
coeds

take
shot
every

you
see
some
dude
with
a
koi

tattoo
sorry
for
the
snark

be
sooooo
tire
of
the
lookalikes
on

i
am
get
too
old
for
this
but
seriously
i
digress
a
many
others
have
state
you
come
here
for
the
atmosphere
and
the
above
average
bar
food
and
drink
we
wait
and
wait
and
wait
for
someone
to
come
take
our
drink
order
before
my
husband
finally
go
to
the
bar
and
order
our
drink
i
would
have
ask
him
to
order
additional
drink
have
i
know
how
slow
the
service
be
go
to
be
and
it
be
not
even
busy
our
bloody
mary
come
out
fairly
quickly
once
we
order
them
and
i
order
fried
oyster
the
waiter
bring
out
the
other
kind
the
slippery
boogery
still
stick
to
it
crusty
shell
kind
i
be
a
good
sport
and
eat
two
my
husband
finish
off
the
rest
i
will
add
that
sometime
that
weekend
we
conceive
our
son
so
maybe
i
should
throw
an
extra
star
their
way
because
we
often
joke
the
oyster
and
bloody
mary
be
what
do
it
my
husband
happen
to
really
like
this
place
so
i
suppose
i
should
throw
in
an
additional
star
but
this
be
my
review
not
his
so
two
it
be
one
for
the
food
and
one
for
the
atmosphere
the
others
they
could
earn
by
improve
service
and
run
a
clorox
wipe
over
the
table
]
[
so
disappointed
with
my
experience
tonight
that
i
will
likely
never
return
to
this
location
again
and
question
if
i
will
continue
to
patronize
the
chain
at
all
i
have
be
to
or
of
their
location
and
have
always
without
question
have
a
great
experience
both
in
term
of
food
quality
and
service
tonight
however
be
different
i
walk
into
my
home
town
lucille
and
be
smugly
greeted
by
some
half
hazard
welcome
the
guy
serve
a
host
be
le
than
friendly
but
manage
to
ask
me
how
many
in
my
party
one
i
reply
from
here
he
speak
into
his
headset
microphone
to
summon
someone
to
come
seat
me
he
hand
her
my
soon
to
be
menu
and
say
put
him
in
the
bar
now
there
be
many
time
that
i
prefer
to
sit
in
the
bar
but
tonight
just
be
not
one
of
them
and
furthermore
i
would
just
prefer
to
have
be
ask
if
this
option
be
ok
i
have
just
land
from
a
week
long
business
trip
and
stop
by
lucille
to
have
dinner
to
allow
the
traffic
to
die
down
i
might
also
add
that
i
be
dress
in
business
attire
i
do
not
look
like
some
bum
off
the
street
and
could
not
understand
why
i
could
not
have
a
regular
table
with
the
others
i
be
shuffle
off
to
the
bar
where
i
be
offer
one
of
the
high
top
table
my
money
be
obviously
not
good
enough
to
rent
one
of
the
empty
din
room
table
for
minute
it
be
pm
by
the
way
it
be
ahead
of
the
prime
busy
dinner
period
of
pm
etc
every
single
high
top
table
be
empty
also
to
give
you
an
idea
of
how
busy
the
place
be
i
do
not
want
a
high
top
table
so
i
ask
for
something
else
i
be
offer
some
random
top
table
sit
right
in
the
entrance
of
the
bar
i
am
one
person
why
would
i
want
a
top
table
well
obviously
again
my
money
be
simply
not
welcome
for
a
dinning
room
table
with
the
common
folk
i
do
not
want
this
large
table
or
it
poor
location
so
my
third
and
final
option
be
the
booth
right
out
of
the
kitchen
it
be
obvious
that
there
be
no
way

i
be
go
to
get
one
of
those
seemingly
high

i
ask
the
girl
that
seat
me
why
i
be
not
give
a
choice
if
i
want
to
sit
in
the
bar
she
become
a
bit
defensive
and
say
that
why
i
ask
you
if
want
to
sit
here
or
over
there
no
not
you
i
want
to
know
why
the
rude
guy
that
tell
you
to

me
in

not

alcoholic

not

you

their
perception

that
you
would
not
tip
enough
to
get
a
dinning

i

very
well

what
i
want
order
fast

i
am
out

there

there
be

for
the

would
have
be
better
off
to
put
me
in
the
dinning

would
have
allow
them
to
turn
the

i
find
out
there

once
kinda
close
to
where
we
live
i
could
not
wait
to
take
my
wife
there
we
save
money
and
buy
gift
card
so
we
could
take
a
late
afternoon
during
a
saturday
and
go
my
ma
get
a
gift
card
of
her

too
because
we
want
to
go
enjoy
the
food
and
show
my
wife
what
we
think
would
be
a
great
place
to
eat

turn
out
not
so
much

go
yesterday

drive
from

those
in

like
yesterday
know
what
that
drive
can
be
like
my
wife
have
a
heat
condition
so
when
we
be
seat
on
the
indoor
patio
we
sit
there
for
a
few
seeing
if
it
would
cool
down
and
her
temp
would
a
well
but
no
such
luck
so
we
ask
if
we
could
be
move
just
inside
where
it
be
much
cooler
a
hostess
come
and
get
and
take
to
the
other
side
of
the
restaurant

try
to
seat
just
in
another
area
of
the
inside
patio
my
ma
ask
her
for
the
free
table
that
be
just
inside
from
where
we
have
be
to
begin
with

there
we
be
finally
seat
and
finally
could
feel
cool

several
time
we
get
one
order
of
bread
which
be
hard
like
it
have
be
sit
out
for
a
long
while
no
butter
with
the
bread
and
then
finally
come

food
and
my
ma
ask
for
fresh
bread
the
waiter
say
right
away

great
grill

could
tell
by
all
the
water
on
her
plate
and
then
gravy
for
her
mashed
potato
which
should
have
have
some
thickness
to
it
but
be
like

i
have
mash
potato
which
taste
great
and
steak
which
be
suppose
to
be
medium
rare
but
be
more
like
well
and
be
more
like
a
piece
of
carne
asada
i
would
get
at
a
mexican
restaurant
and
the
steak
gravy
taste
extremely
different
than
it
do
from
the
one
in
ca
like
they
have
add
a
major
spiciness
to
it
my
wife
get
a
fried
shrimp
po

she
do
not
want
to
risk
eat
anything
to
heavy
with
the
heat
the
shrimp
be
small
medium
size
taste
okay
there
be
tomato
slice
in
the
sandwich
that
be
slice
so
thick

if
they
should
have

when

about

still

she
be
an
assistant

come
by
and
ask
how
everything
be
my
ma
let
her
know

for
about
min

the
waiter
start
to
come
with
the

she
tell
him
we
do
not
want

we
do
not
we
have
a
very
disappointing
dinner

and
i
both
felt
bad
to
take
my
wife
to
such
a
bad
experienced
dinner
the
only
reason
i
am
give
this
place
star
be
because
the
district
manager
come
over
and
talk
to
apologize
for
everything
and
say
she
would
be
send
out
some
gift
card
to
hopefully
try
them
again

because
even
though
a
lot
of
it
be
wrong
and
do
not
taste
good
some
do
taste
good

maybe
we
catch
this
place
on
a
wrong
day
if
we
do
receive
the
card
a
told
then
we
will
return
and
give
it
another
try
after
the
sun
go
down

it

take
me
a

change
the

a

this
we
finally
receive
the

card
from
them
to
go
back

it
be
only
for
when
the
manager
have
say
she
would
make
sure
we
get
all
our
money
back
in

we
could
go
back

have
a
better

we

the

card

i

the

actually
make
me

it
that
a
pretty
fucking
good
lemonade
i

five
dollar

it

so
the

then
ask
if
if
we
would
like
an
appetizer

we
order
a
half

cardinal
sin
not

they

fried
everything

ridiculous
shortcoming

return
those
to

your

back

great
attentive

on
the
eye

usually
give
star

the
night
not
so
much
ab
hopefully
do
not
change
the

would
not

it
past
them

in
the

in

a

of

about

even

about

what
bring
them
back
every
friday

saturday

those
literally
addictive

obviously
nobody

off

hard
time

rate

initial
reaction

a
but
there

a
few
thing

really
bug
me
here

i
really
would
say
it
more
of
a
the
first
negative
be
park
the
lot
behind
the
restaurant
be
always
full

good
luck
find
a
close
spot

street

across
the
street

try

park
in

just

good

opinion

best
advise

you
do
like

stick

you
get
two
huge
piece
of
chicken
on
top

mashed

would
end
up
with
left

my
stomach
hurt

go
there
for
my
birthday

chicken
be
burn
on
the
edge

potato
be
slightly
warm

order
one
of
those
fancy
drink
i
be
not
much
of
a
drinker

usually
one
be
enough
to
make
me
buzz
this
thing
be
buck
and
have
so
very
little
alcohol
in
it
it
taste
good
but
darn
i
should
of
just
get
the
sweet
tea
at
least
it
do
not
pretend
to
be
alcohol

really
feel
this

go
down

be
pretty
pricey

not

i
completely
understand
that
people
at
prime

take
no

be
i
feel
like
they
do
not
even
try
to
seat

we
would
leave

because
we
be
young

enormous
wave
of
people
spill
out

the
line
outside
empty
we

after
another
minute
of
wait

the
seaters
avoid

we
still
be
not

it
take
about
hour
to
get
seat

our
party
have
to
be
split
up
also
those
lady
at

a
better
attitude
you
give
dirty
look
the
entire
night
food

fantastic

it

the
outside
appearance

our
decision
for
a
late

the

it
definitely
be
not
very

seem

forever

a

appear

it

not
thoroughly

the
rib
be
not

long

come
off

you
would
normally
think
a

would
ask
how
you
like
the
meal
especially
when
the
plate
be
take
back
nearly
full

so
if
you
want
better
barbecue
i
would
suggest
a
trip
across
the
parking
lot
to
dave
or
to
joe

hand
down
those
two

for

it
be
sad
to

of
hidden

gem
throughout

lucile
so
we
get
there
and

bolt
right
intothe

it
not

like
the
regular
dining
area
so
we
get
greet
by
our
waiter
i
ask
him
a
simple
question
what
the
difference
between
tritip
and
brisket
he
reply
confidently
tri
tip
be
a
leaner
cut
from
the
muscle
in
the
back
and
brisket
be
a
shoulder
cut
which
have
more
fat
both
very
good
he
addedso
i
go
with
the

but
mine

cut
differently
i
ignore
the
appearance
and
dig
in
i
immediately
notice
the
amount
of
fat
throughout
each
cut
i
think
to
myself

this
fucker
mess
up
my
order
i
ask
my
friend

[
my
husband
and
i
decide
to
stop
here
yesterday
for
an
early
dinner
and
arrive
around
pm
the
place
be
pretty
empty
so
when
the
hostess
ask
if
we
want
a
booth
or
table
i
respond
with
do
not
matter
really
just
a
good
spotwell
the
spot
she
choose
be
a
booth
right
next
to
their
big
smoker
that
be
a
hot
a
a
furnace
and
radiating
that
heat
big
time
come
in
from
degree
i
know
we
be
never
go
to
be
able
to
sit
there
so
when
the
waiter
come
to
the
table
i
ask
very
politely
if
we
could
be
move
he
say
he
would
have
to
check
with
the
front
desk
and
drift
away
finally
he
come
back
and
say
we
would
have
to
move
to
a
table
and
we
say
that
great
and
of
course
he
move
right
next
to
a
table
with
a
scream
baby
payback
i
guess
for
ask
anyway
on
to
the
food
i
have
to
say
that
i
be
a
little
take
aback
by
the
lack
of
any
early
bird
special
on
food
or
beverage
in
this
economy
even
fleming
be
do
a
great
happy
hour
we
order
rib
i
have
the
baby
back
and
my
husband
have
the
st
louis
the
waiter
say
we
have
side
and
i
ask
for
a
salad
he
say
that
be
not
one
of
the
choice
and
it
would
be
more
ok
so
i
finally
decide
on
the
garlic
mash
potato
and
the
bean
the
biscuit
they
bring
to
start
the
meal
be
really
good
with
the
honey
cinnamon
butter
but
only
come
on
be
a
little
more
generous
the
salad
arrive
and
they
be
pretty
much
the
stock
salad
nothing
fabulous
then
the
plate
come
and
i
have
to
say
the
bbq
rib
be
just
ok
nothing
great
and
kinda
dry
and
the
side
be
fine
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
be
so
disappointed
if
it
be
not
for
the
fact
that
the
meal
along
with
large
beer
and
no
dessert
be
before
tip
come
on
that
be
ridiculous
we
can
eat
at
joes

daves
for
half
that

will
i
return
no
probably
not

i
be
go
to
spend
for
dinner
i
can
go

down

from

be
literally
from
a
town
in
kentucky

turkey

back

that

my
taste

southern

fine

try

loosen
the
rein

type
this

anyone

i

beef

good

delicious

great

the
service
be
on
point

first

notice
a
change
be
in
december

the

definitely
nowhere
near

i
do
not

i
will
ever
go
back

in
the
afternoon

definitely
not
busy

everything
we
ask

already
put
a
damper

we
get
our
food
i
would
honestly
say
it
be
borderline
gross
just
so
not
what
it
use
to
be

it
make
me
so
sad

i

the
idea

actually
like
it

look
forward

it
again

walk
in

there

a

most
of
the
table
be
open
weird

the
bar
be
open

just
grab
a
table

an
order

sweet
potato

the

actually
really
good

something
about

funky

there

something

off

at
the
chicken

the
sugary
biscuit
you
get
with
your

good

memphisstyle

meat

the
original
and
spicy
sauce

st

probably
about
lb

tritip
add
to

side

for
from
a
value

great

i
saw
a
review
below
that
take
issue
to
the
reference
to
st
louis
style
rib
please
inform
yourself
before
you
go
all
loco
about
this
be
a
southern
restaurant
but
st
louis
be
north
of
the
masondixon
line
fyi
st
louis
style
spar
typically
refers
to
the
cut
of
rib
you
basically
cut
the
riblets
off
the
spare
rib
not
how
they
be
cook
or
seasoning
it
would
be
like
someone
complain
about
a
new
york
strip
steak
be
serve
in
a
french
restaurant
ok
now
that
i
have
get
that
off
my
chest
biscuit
salad

side
which
we
get
vegetable
and
the
peanut
slaw
all
rat
cb
while
i
understand
the
side
be
not
the
most
typical
bbq
side
fixins
we
do
not
want
to
go
too
overboard
hey
they
be
on
the
menu
they
should
be
better
the
salad
be
your
typical
crappy
house
salad
the
biscuit
be
hockey
puck
save
for
the
sweet
butter
but
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
handle
greasy
biscuit
anyways
rib
they
use
hickory
to
smoke
which
i
am
never
a
fan
of
for
pork
and
i
do
not
know
if
they
use
an
commercial
electric
smoker
or
a
wood
burning
pit
i
am
guess
the
former
but
overall
they
be
above
average
the
baby
be
much
better
than
the
spare
the
spare
really
lack
a
smoke
ring
or
good
smoke
flavor
but
the
baby
be
very
tasty
and
moist
spare
be
pretty
dry
which
be
unusual
consider
spare

typically
fattier
perhaps
they
do
not
move
them
a
fast
and
they
be
hold
warm
longer
a
another
reviewer
speculate
but
the
bonus
for
me
be
the
meat
be
not
fall
off
the
bone
anybody
who
know
anything
about
good
bbq
know
this
be
a
sign
of
overcooked
mushy
rib
the
meat
hold
on
the
bone
and
a
good
tug
clean
the
meat
mostly
off
finally
someone
know
how
to
cook
rib
and
stick
to
their
gun
with
the
doneness
the
sauce
kind
of
blew
it
for
me
sooo
sweet
taste
like
a
typical
kansa
city
style
sauce
i
will
probably
order
them
dry
next
time
and
moreso
to
really
get
a
sense
of
the
flavor
of
the
naked
meat
without
the
sauce
kill
the
flavor
i
taste
the
memphis
style
sauce
they
have
at
the
table
but
other
than
the
fact
it
be
too
thick
it
have
good
memphis
tomatoeyvinegary
flavor
and
lack
all
of
the
sugar
overall
i
rate
the
rib
a
b
chicken
and
tritip
be
really
tasty
the
tritip
be
a
tad
dry
but
certainly
not
enough
to
stop
me
from
order
it
again
i
would
not
call
it
a
traditional
santa
mariastyle
tritip
but
really
good
nonetheless
probably
because
it
do
not
have
sauce
coat
it
the
hickory
really
complement
beef
much
better
the
chicken
be
probably
the
highlight
of
the
meal
both
dark
and
white
meat
be
cook
perfectly
and
be
juicy
the
sauce
be
apply
sufficiently
so
that
it
be
not
too
sweet
but
add
to
the
good
flavor
of
the
chicken
i
doubt
they
solely
smoke
the
chicken
a
do
so
typically
yield
a
rubbery
skin
but
they
could
have
either
cook
it
over
an
open
pit
or
do
some
sort
of
hybrid
cook
method
to
give
the
skin
a
good
texture
while
infuse
some
good
smoke
into
the
meat
b
for
the
tritip
a
for
the
chicken
finally
the
dessert
be
mixed
we
order
the
peach
cobbler
and
banana
pudding
the
pudding
be
rich
and
thick
and
not
too
sweet
while
the
cobbler
be
pretty
brutal
they
use
dried
peach
which
be
reconstitute
or
at
least
that
be
what
it
taste

down
to
a
particular
style
of
barbeque
of
course
this
mean
that
they
do
not
do
anything
particularly
well
but
it
also
mean
that
you
could
take
a
big
group
of
people
here
from
all
different
part
of
the
country

they
would
each
be
able
to
find
something
they
want
to
eat
on

not
that
the
reason
for
have
chain
restaurant
in
the
first
place
a
lot
of
the
dish
be
serve
dry
and
then
you
could
add
your
own
sauce
they
have
different
bottle
on
the
table
and
this
be
one
of
the
few
place
we
have
find
in
phoenix
that
serve
texas
style
beef

that
be
a
big

we
also
try
the
fry
green
tomato

the
okra
for
appetizer
neither
be
very
good
seriously
stay
away
from
the
tomato
but
i
have
not
have
either
of
them
since
we
live
in

south

even
a

never

the

probably
should

two

i
compare
it
to

barbeque

eat
at
nationally

compare
to
what
i
have

in

solid

that
they
have
a
really
good
selection

even
offer
micheladas
i
never

that
drink
would
go
with
bbq

it
be
a
pretty
good
pairing
with
the
spicy
texasstyle
sauce

bad
they
could
not

this

they

some
mexican

half

popcorn

up

empty

one
other

me
pretty
fast

about
minute

we
later
find
out
we
can
get
them
much
much
cheaper
from
liquor
store
today
my
husband
and
i
go
there
again
because
we
be
hungry
and
we
live
nearby
i
do
not
plan
to
drink
beer
so
i
do
not
bother
to
bring
my
driver
license
guess
what
they
do
not
let
me
in
this
be
ridiculous
for
several
reason
if
i
do
not
drink
alcohol

do
i
have
to
show
my
driver
license

get
in

saw
family
take
their
infant

kid
inside

this
be
like
all
adult
place
i
would
be
ok
but
if
it
a
familyfriendly
place
why
ca
not
i
go
in
and
have
some
dinner
with
my
husband
without
order
alcohol
i
be
year
old

i
wonder
how
hard
it
be
to
decide
i
am
not
under

find
a
picture
on
my
phone

i
take
a
photo
of
my
license
and
i
show
this
to
the
gate

guess
what
he
do
not
even
look
and
say
that
be
not
acceptable

keep
say
that
you
ca
not
be
hang
around

you
can
do
takeout

this
century
anyone
can
wave
a
fake
driver
license
in

of
your
eye

it
do
not
make
sense
to
think
that
picture
be
not
credible
but
only
physical
one
my
only
conclusion
be
that
he
do
not
let
me
in
because
i
be
asian
and
i
spoke
with
an
accent
unless
you
guarantee
me
that
you
have
never
let
anyone
inside

check

i
highly
doubt
there
be
so

the

for
sure
wo
not

[
dear
four
peak
it
so
hard
in
today
generic
corporate
drive
society
to
find
a
place
that
take
pride
in
their
product
like
you
do
brew
eight
variety
of
beer
on
a
regular
basis
and
create
new
and
exciting
seasonal
brew
with
the
tender
love
intimacy
that
only
a
small
business
can
provide
you
deserve
an
incredible
amount
of
credit
for
that
my
question
for
you
be
do
they
all
have
to
taste
assy
i
mean
i
know
some
people
like
the
taste
of
your
arizona
peach
ale
but
the
last
time
i
try
it
i
do
something
uncharacteristic
i
do
not
even
finish
the
whole
thing
it
smell
like
country
time
heaven
but
it
taste
like
fetid
peach
bile
your
ipa
hop
knot
and
oatmeal
stout
give
me
bitter
beer
face
but
since
they
are
suppose
to
have
strong
character
and
flavor
i
accept
this
inevitability
and
leave
them
to
someone
who
will
love
them
with
all
the
passion
they
deserve
and
it
seem
like
your
kiltlifter
exist
only
to
get
me
plow
in
record
time
at
about
alcohol
by
volume
so
that
a
good
thing
and
mean
it
bind
to
be
strong
like
a
bull
so
i
can
accept
the
as
factor
when
it
boil
down
to
it
the
only
beer
you
have
on
tap
that
seem
fit
for
my
consumption
be
the
th
street
ale
and
the
hefewiezen
but
even
those
leave
me
with
a
hang
over
the
next
morning
do
i
do
something
wrong
be
that
why
you
do
not
like
me
be
that
why
you
feel
it
necessary
to
have
your
beer
drill
it
way
into
my
skull
and
leave
me
with
a
headache
the
morning
after
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
fancy
import
and
run
of
the
mill
domestic
beer
i
consume
at
other
bar
do
not
even
cause
me
to
blink
an
eye

think
we
have
a
pretty
solid
relationship

since
i
have
not
be
visit
you
that
often
i
guess
you
have
have
a
change
of

i
will
make
a
concerted
effort
to
swing
by
for
happy
hour
every
now
and
then
to
share
a
pitcher
between
and
but
only
when
somebody
else
suggest
we
visit
you
just
seem
to
slip
through
the
crack
whenever
my
little
barfly
mind
start
think
up
fun
place
to
enjoy
a
couple
brew
after
work
luckily
that
be
not
the
case
when
my
grumble
stomach
do
the
talk
because
your
food
be
delicious
and
would
be
a
terrible
thing
to
miss
out
on
i
think
it
may
also
have
something
to
do
with
your
patio
which
be
unwelcoming
and
a
freakin
madhouse
at
all

the

i
can
get
one
those
gigantic
square

let
me
chat
with
the
people
to
either
side
of
me

i
am
practically
sit
in
the
lap
of
the
people
behind

me
to
maneuver
like
a
slinky
snake
just
to
get
out

my
chair

weasel
my
way

not

off

job
be

pick
my
way
through

that
why
sometimes
i
get
poor
service
on
the

your
indoor

area
have
always
have
the
most
attentive

you
offer
be
phenomenal

for
a
place
that
call
itself

have
go
above

beyond
the
basic
need
for
chex

rockin

a

it
on

iffy

that

amazing
artichoke

sauce

about
how
great
the

be
at

close
by

check
out
four
peak
early
on

be
back
a
number
of
time

i
have
try
a

just
do
not
do
it

me
i
am
a

of
the

everyone
else
seem

i
am

crazy

suck
about

the
ambiance
it
a
cool
place
to
hang
out

watch
a
game

it
a
good
place

somewhat
forgettable

here

a
dozen
time

the
last
or
have

a
let
down
never
anything
big

little
thing
that
annoy
you
to
the
point

now
i
will
probably
not
go
back
we
use
to
literally
love
this
place
my
entire
family
do
so
we
always
go
here
with
the
family
for
outing
a
they
be
good
for
group
take
reservation
and
be
delicious
the
thing
that
annoy
me
more
than
a
little
bit
be
how
they
nickel
dime
you
with
price
the
drink
be
all
about
higher
than
most
place
nothing
huge
but
a
little
small
price
poke
not
the
money
more
the
principle
a
it
kind
of
a
hidden
fee
in
my
opinion
unless
you
want
to
order
water
i
guess
when
you
be
take
out
your
family
that
an
extra
right
on
the
top
or
in
the
case
of
over
with
a
large
group
my
first
bone
to
pick
be
their
lemonade
they
always
offer
it
when
take
the
drink
order
can
i
get
you
an
iced
tea
or
maybe
a
lemonade
or
strawberry
lemonade
sound
good
of
course
and
my
kid
always
want
the
lemonade
and
i
always
forget
that
it
the
price
of
an
alcoholic
drink
not
a
normal
although
high
already
beverage
price
like
soda
or
tea
and
you
guess
it
they
never
tell
you
this
when
they
offer
it
and
you
order
it
i
have
be
surprise
by
this
charge
for
the
last
time
and
will
not
be
go
back
to
be
fair
the
service
here
have
always
be
good
and
the
food
good
a
well
but
in
addition
to
the
drink
price
they
raise
several
of
their
other
dish
price
a
well
i
notice
this
but
even
my
inlaw
mention
it
a
well
which
make
my
decision
easier
they
have
always
gouge
on
drink
and
always
be
a
little
more
expensive
than
similar
place
like
texas
roadhouse
but
now
that
they
raise
the
price
they
have
price
themselves
out
of
the
market
for
me
i
do
not
do
this
to
smear
them
just
my
opinion
they
be
not
any
better
than
those
type
of
place
and
those
place
do
not
have
the
b
hidden

get
me

rather
dry

dry

no

test

it
off

cob

some
good
food
and
a
beer
to
wash
down
a
very
bad

maybe
it

the

i
put
out
that
would
explain
why
this
visit
be
so
bad
but
i
will
let
you
determine
that
so
i
tell
my
friend
that
this
place
have
amazing
lettuce
wrap
because
they
do
meaning
we
get
there
they

it
would
be
about
mins
for
our
table
that
fine
i
buy
a
round
of
drink
at
the
bar
mins
later
our
table
be
ready
awesome

sit
down

i
look
at
the

no
lettuce
wrap
our
waitress
come
i
look
at
her
and
say
i
am
so
sad
you
guy
do
not
have
your
lettuce
wrap
anymore
it
be
not
a
question
or
me
ask
if
there
be
a
secret
menu
that
they
be
not
share
but
she
just
sigh
at
me
and
say
if
it
not
on
the
menu
we
do
not
have
it
they
discontinue
those
about
month
ago
i
do
not
think
i
say
it
rudely
but
i
assume
by
her
tone
she
think
that
i
do
anyway
my
friend
and
i
ask
for
some
water
because
we
already
have
beer
she
walk
away
come
back
i
kid
you
not
mins
later
i
know
because
i
be
texting
my
husband
about
the
lettuce
wrap

she
walk
away
and
i
look
at
the
time
when
she
come
back
we
order
our
food
which
by
the
way
my
friend
be
starve
so
she
order
both
a
pizza
and
their
chicken
enchilada
i
order
the
meatloaf
our
waitress
walk
away
and
come
back
mins
later
to
tell
me
that
they
run
out
of
the
meatloaf
so
she
ask
if
i
would
like
to
order
anything
else
i
look
at
my
friend
laugh
and
say
that
my
day
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
recall
what
be
on
the
menu
so
i
look
at
our
waitress
and
she
say
in
a
very
annoyed
voice
i
will
bring
the
menu
back
for
you
and
leaf
that
would
not
have
bother
me
so
much
if
there
be
not
a
menu
at
the
little
station

have
set
up
with
utensil
napkin

menu
not
ft
away
from
where
we
be

she
go
goodness
know
where
to
supposedly
grab
me
a
menu
and
come
back
another
mins
later
i
just
order
a
burger
because
i
do
not
know
when
i
will
get
a
chance
to
order
again
the
night
go
on
and
a
nice
man
bring
our

our
waitress

not
bring

i
didnt
need
it

my

up

grab
her

okay
the
pizza

the
best
i
ask
for
a
medium
cook
burger

this
be
ridiculously
well

dry

i

do
not
see
our

again
until
our

be
dry

have
melt

and
even
though
we
want
to
try
a
dessert
by
this
time
we
be
anxious
just
to
leave
my
friend
felt
terrible
and
offer
to
pay
because
she
already
have
her
card
out
and
she
be
not
about
to
let
our

disappear
and
leave

sit
there

i
truly
talk

up
on
our

we
both
leave
very
disappointed
]
[
okay
let
me
be
honest
i
am
bias
in
favor
of
texas
style
bbq
dry
rub
before
be
smoke
and
sauce
always
on
the
side
with
sauce
that
be
tomato
and
vinegar
base
on
the
spicy
side
lucille
while
a
well
run
establishment
be
more
towards
the
the
perspective
of
bbq
come
with
sauce
on
it
even
when
i
ask
for
the
dry
a
a
bone
option
on
a
beef
rib
it
have
be
sauce
and
then
grill
good
but
certainly
not
dry
bbq
in
addition
all
the
sauce
seem
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
i
will
say
the
service
be
generally
good
and
the
watermelon
ice
tea
if
nothing
else
i
would
stop
in
for
a
glass
of
that
on
a
hot
day
if
i
be
in
the
area
in
addition
this
place
be
more
of
a
bbq
a
a
specialty
item
with
a
price
to
match
they
seem
to
charge
on
the
high
side
and
i
am
more
in
favor
of
hole
in
the
wall
joint
like
little
miss
bbq
down
on
university
towards
nd
street
one
other
thing
that
be
exceptional
be
the
hot
link
sausage
well
grill
and
more
of
the
beef
with
black
pepper
flavor
that
epitomize
the
bbq
sausage
in
texas

it
strong
german
root
look
my
view
here
be
base
on
my
personal
taste

i
bet
there
be
some
people
who
will
find
this
their
complete
cup
of
tea
if
you
like
wet
bbq
with
a
sweet
sauce
and
better
yet
mustard
base
this
place
be
for
you
and
i
encourage
you
to
get
your
own
perspective
if
nothing
else
a
unique
place
to
eat
in
the
marketplace
that
seem
to
have
a
bit
more
authenticity
than
your
average
chain
restaurant

for
almost
the

would
have
be
too
much
for
one
person

my
opinion

for
two
it
be
large
enough
there
be
no
waste
or
take
home

there
could
have
be
more

be
honest
they
only
give
you
a
handful
and
i
think
for
what
you
get
be
a
bit
much
their
pricing
be
high

of

be
anywhere
from

not

suppose
to
be

the
reason
it

often

the
tough

good
the
chicken
on
the

much
better

the
pulled
pork

to
my

really
good

the

caution

from
one
of

their
commentary

more
crispy

sweet
potato
pancake

the
chocolate
ganache

all
three
of
agree
the
sweet
potato
pancake
be
the
most
impressive

that
these

easier

i
think
the
execution
on

very
poor

it

it

cater
more
to
a
college
scene
my

at

it

about
occupy
for

no

a
yet
because
it
be
a

too
chilly
still
by
the

we
leave
though
the
line
be
out
the

onto
the
sidewalk
at
almost
am

order
the

of
each
type
of
egg
benedict
with
the
bella
bella
benny
and
the

verde
benedict
with
pulled
pork

the
chili
sauce
tortilla
that
they
have
a
the
bread
for
the
chili
verde
benedict
be
very
different
but
i
be
not
too
sell
on
it
it
might
be
the
texture
or
the
corn
tortilla
flavor
overpower
the
rest
of
the
benedict
it
be
not
a
hit
for
me
the
hollandaise
egg
and
pull
pork
though
be
pretty
good
for
the
bella
bella
benny
the
slice
of
ciabata
bread
it
come
on
be
so
thin
and
just
underwhelming
the
prosciutto
egg
and
hollandaise
sauce
again
be
spot
on
but
with
how
salty
prosciutto
be
i
felt
like
there
should
be
a
more
hearty
piecetype
of
bread
to
balance
out
that
natural
saltiness
of
the
prosciutto
the
meal
come
with
hash
brown
which
to
me
be
the
only
perfect
for
me
item
on
my
plate
the
outside
brown
and
crisp
on
the
outside
moist
and
cook
just
right
on
the
inside
my
other
complaint
be
that
they
neither
have
blue
cheese
dress
nor
ranch
dressingdipping
sauce
and
those
be
my
sauce

another
thing
be
snooze

it
always
have
a

of
similarity
to
the
one
before
it
like
they
remix

be
on
the

they
have
a

sometimes
they
are
great

it

our
third

only
reason
why
i
am
give
it
a

not

want
to
treat
our
good
friend

celebrate
their
union
after
consider
several
different
place
for
dinner
we
decide
on
this
one
make
reservation
day

there

place

pack

notie
an
empty

the
fire

we
assume
be
ours

without

at
a
table

dark
corner

use
our
cell
phone
to
read
the

the

just
luke
warm

in

only
reason
for
not

for
the
great
visit

with

it

a

really
really
look
forward

fairly
regularly

could
say
we

a
good
experience

we
always
use
to

it

pretty
awful

we
eat
out
at

every
other
week

busy
restaurant

understand
slow
service
happens
especially
on
busy
night

we
arrive
hour
and
minute
ahead
of
the
show

allow
for
that
what
we
didnt
understand
be
a
server
i
wo
not
mention
his
name
who
from
the
beginning
seem
disconnected
uninterested

seem
to
act
a
though
he
didnt
want
to
be
there
even
when
thing
fell
apart
he
make
very
little
attempt
at
make
thing
right
we
have
always
have
exceptional
service
every
time
prior
at
house

this
be
just
so
unexpected

quite
a
while
after
the
table
next
to
even
though
we
arrive
before
them
they
order
almost
exactly
what
we
do
so
it
be
not
the
type
of
food
that
be
the
delay
our
table
be
rarely
check
on
except
by
the
busboy
with
water
and
no
attempt
at
an
apology
be
give
until
i
complain
about
the
long
delay
our
server
finally
check
on
after
the
food
arrive
and
ask
how
everything
taste
we
didnt
know
a
the
busboy
have
take
our
silverware
and
didnt
return
with
any
until
several
minute
after

the
food

very
good

good

pretty
awful

the
credit

free

on
a

a
sad
attempt
at
try

make
thing
right
no
sight
of
the
manager
either

to
me

if

look
for
something

it
seem
like
you
should
provide
good

this
be
my
first

here

maybe
it
be
just
a
fluke

both
the
bartender

our

be
really
inattentive

stand
at
the
bar
for
quite
awhile

for
someone
to
even
glance
in
our
direction

there

several
people

nice

we

he
take
our
order

then
he
completely
disappear
he
never
once
refill
our
water
or
ask
if
we
want
more
drink
we
finally
get
a
busser
to
refill
our
water
after
everyone
have
finish
eating
and
only
then
do
our
waiter
reappear
to
give
the
check
by
that
point
no
one
want
dessert
or
coffee
which
probably
would
have
be
delicious

we
do
not

encourage

stay

the

okay

neither
the
green
nor
the

out
the
main
flavor
that
come
out
be
that
of
the

the
delicate

out

just

that
the
dish
be
too
heavy
maybe
some
people
really
like
it
but
for
me
it
be
too
nutty
and
the
sauce
way
too
thick
and
creamy
almost
soupy
generally
in
restaurant
of
this
caliber
i
think
of
the
pasta
dish
be
lighter
so
that
i
can
enjoy
the
delicateness
of
the
housemade
pasta

pasta

not

mask
the
use

dining
opinion

that

mushroom

truffle
oil

i
have
a
very
poor

turn
me
off
anything
too
overbear

i
wo
not
eat
it
this
be
a
good
level
of
truffle
oil
the
goat
cheese
be
a
good
balance
to
the
truffle
oil
and
the
basil
be
light
and
complementary
the
pasta
bolognese
though
umm
strange
there
be
a
very
clove
y
taste
to
it
that
be
not
expect
maybe
that
not
my
taste
which
i
get
however
the
pappardelle
oh
i
forget
i
am
not
a
pappardelle
person
so
bad
combo
maybe
be
nowhere
close
to
al
dente
it
be
soggy
oh
and
lukewarm

i
will
chalk
that
up
to
have
to
wait
minute
for
a
pasta
the
garlic
bread
with
this
be
the
highlight

also
very
lukewarm
now

it
be
a
friday
night

be
not
pack

it
be
fairly
full
still

friend
walk
in
and
be
seat
right
away
within
minute
of
order
we
get
our
house
salad
follow
that
nothing
for
minute
idk
about
you
but
i
like
to
eat
my
salad
with
my
entree
and
multiple
waiter
keep
come
to
try
and
take
my
salad
away
a
i

another
minute
for
my
pastapizza
my
friend
nearly
finish
her
pinot
noir
that
she
have
order
specifically
to
go
with
the
bolognese
a
well
so
i
guess
you
could
say
we
be
unimpressed
with
the
wait
time
the
part
that
disappoint
me
most
be
see
multiple
party
come
in
after
get
their
food
and
leave
before
we
get
our
foodas
our
food
just
arrive

while
i
really
want
to
like
this
place
i
can
not
say
i
will
be
come
here
again
if
i
be
to
come
back
i
would
order
differently

with

that

by
six

the
mark

ask
if
we
want
a

no

in
my

taste
too

only
have
one
slice
of
her
pizza

tell
myself
no

think
the
reason
why
this
be
a
star
review
instead
of
a
star
review
be
because
the

me
wrong
she
be
not
mean

anything

just
the
air
around
her
felt
very
unwelcoming

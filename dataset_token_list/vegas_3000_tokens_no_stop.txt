it

you
let
the
nurse
spank
you
watch
the
nurse
dole
out
spanking
be
pretty
hilarious

whipped
cream
vodka

out

actually
shot

know
it
be
the
tastiest
frozen
drink

if
you
be
childish
enough
to
enjoy
whipped
cream
vodka
i
be
then
you
will
definitely
appreciate
the

no
pat
of
butter

not

fan

probably

they
proudly

that
they
be
douse
in
animal

before

it
be
just
too
soggy

if

on
a
soft
block

the

they
use
only
cream

garnish
be
with
a
slice
of
butter
on
top
i
understood
why
it

it

could

sugary

lbs
everything

cheese
onion

off

try

it
really
not
the
burger

i
got
be
decent

not
anything
special

service
be
not
that
good
i
just
order
a
single
bypass
burger

it
be
moist
but
not
juicy

the
fry
be
brown

really
need
salt
to
taste
good
they
be
rather
flimsy

really
nothing
special
even
if
they
be
in
fact
cook
in
lard
a
for
service
it
be
not
the
worst
but
it
could
have
be
better
the
hostess
at
the
front
really
look
miserable
and
like
she
do
not
want
to
be
there
the
nurse
who
serve
me
at
my
table
be
okay

after
she
take
my
order
i
wait
around
minute
for
a
burger

people

have
be
in

come
out
at
the

time
the
nurse
do
check
on
me
once

otherwise
she
be
just
mingle
with
the
others
a
well
a
the
doctor
throughout
the
night
the
place
be
rather
empty
too
what
make
this
place
interest
aside
from
the
obvious
hospital
theme
be
the
fact
that
they
show
music
video
of
some
classic
old
hit
on
the
big
screen

also
think
it

cute
how
on

similar

not
my

never

right

to
get
a
baseline
before

sad
that

all
over

folk
with
high
blood
pressure
we
order
one
burger
to
split

coke
actually
pretty
good
but
there
be
much
cheaper
option
in
the
area
i
would
return
if
we
have
friend
with

be
new

this

more

great

have
lot

fun

pretty
good

only
get
the

that

more
than
enough
beware
when
get
the
milkshake
they
be
very
thick

they
put
a
cube

i
come
here

it
be
a
stupid
gimik

i
go
a
long
with
it
because
i
be
hungry
and
in
a
hurry
we
order
our
food
and
when
it
arrive
it
be
not
the
greatest
it
do
not
taste
that
great
and
the
atmosphere
be
cheesy

we
be
eat
we
hear
a

come
in
and
ask
to
be
seat
the
nurse
at
the
front

them

they
have
high
anxiety

it
come
to
cleanliness
the
nurse
argued
with
her
until
the
girl
ask
to
talk
to
a
manager
the
nurse
yell
across
the

to
an
old
guy
in
a
dr

that
she
do
not

she
do
not

how

called

to
get
in
both

the

in
an
aggressive
manner
the
male
part
of
the

be
just
stand
there

do
not

the

to
make
the

threaten
the
guy
after
the
couple
have
exit
the
front
door

when
the
guy
start
to
stand
his
ground

call
the

out

if
you
do
not

spank
you
decide
i
do
not
want
to
get

i
decide
to
share
the
single
we
order
a
couple
of
shake
to
share
be
not
too
keen
on
the
calorie
count
it
claim
but
it
be
pretty
good
we
also
order
the
peniscillin
jello
shot
it
actually
come
out
in
the
shape
of
a
well
i
will
pass
on
the
graphic
and
let
your
imagination
go
to
the
dark
place
the
peniscillin
shot
be
fill
with
white
jello
and
be
like
a
needle
shot
you
would
get
at
the
doctor
office
let
just
say
they
be
not
serve
in
glass
you
shoot
it
in
your
mouth
i
would
have
post
pic
but
i
will
keep
this
grated
the
food
be
nothing
special
it
just
a
burger
load
with
bacon
and
a
ton
of
calorie
it
be
cook
to
my
liking
and
i
am
so
glad
i
share
with
my
friend
because
i
could
barely
finish
it
my
friend
who
order
the
chili
dog
be
not
able
to
finish
his
i
point
out
that
he
be
about
to
get
his
booty
spank
woot
woot
and
he
literally
start
get
nervous
i
actually
do
not
think
they
would
spank
people
but
it
be
fun
tease
the
drunk
guy
he
try
to
get
to
help
him
but
we
refuse
he
try
swap
his
basket
with
another
friend
who
have
finish
his
meal
i
remind
him
stephanie
would
probably
remember
he
order
the
chili
dog
since
he
the
only
one
who
order
it
on
our
table
he
say
there
be
no
way
they
would
spank
customer
and
be
probably
a
gimmick
well
what
do
you
know
at
that
very
moment
we
hear
pack
pack
pack
and
people
cheer
a
guy
be
get
spank
and
the
nurse
be
not
spank
him
gently
either
our
friend
seriously
panic
and
start
grab
everyone
basket
and
try
to
hide
his
unfinished
meal
it
be
hilarious
he
be
beg
not
to
tell
our
waitress
i
really
wanted
to
see
him
get
spank
guess
you
have
to
be
there
cuz
it
be
very
funny
see
him
sweat
when
the
check
come
he
throw
some
money
on
the
table
and
bolt
out
the
door

the
ambience
be

hospital
decoration
there

the
reason
for
the
star
rating
i
think
the
hospital
gown
they
give
you
be
freshly

when

we
put
it

it
a
ok
you
basically
just
come
for
the

by
the
way
it
suck

they
be
too
cheap
to
get
good
mike
for
karaoke
and
the
slap
get
boring

a
while
do
not

a
good
tasting

i
be
to

out
anything

mixed
review
about
this
place
but
everyone
have
there
opinion
the
burger
be
very
juicy
and
have
a
good
taste
not
dry
at
all
the
fry
be
also
good
especially
since
they
be
fry
in
lard
i
have
my
concern
of
them
be
super
soggy
and
like
greasy
but
i
be
very
wrong
i
order
the
double
bypass
burger
with
cheese
and
my
husband
order
the
double
bypass
with
bacon
and
these
burger
be
no
joke
they
be
huge
we
order
a
butterfat
milkshake
it
be
so
yummy
and
so
creamy
and
even
have
a
cube
a
butter
and
a
mini
hershey
bar
a
well
it
be
a
experience
for
me
with
this
milk
shake
they
be
a
cash
only
restaurant
but
they
sell
beer
and
wine
and
frozen
drink
i
think
it
be
cool
the
nurse
aka
our
waitress
take
our
order
on
there
iphone
the
staff
be
great
they

yes
it
may
be
a
healthy
spot

what
burger
joint
be
not
unhealthy

a
shot

you

from

there
be
that
when
you
walk

lay
out
the
rule
in
that
you
have
to
pay

wear
a

gown

a
your
gauge

you
can
eat

be
good

why
not
get
a

accept
cash

have
a

it
only
charge
cent

we
get
our
table
it
be
not
in
a
very
good
spot
though
because
if
you
do
not

they
will
paddle
you
where
we
where
sit
i
could
not
see
anything
all
i
could
do
be
hear
it
so
our

come
over
she
be
realy
nice
i
ca
not
remember
her
name
but
she
let
know
you
ca
not
share
any
food
i
think
she
say
only
the
single
so
i
order
the
single
with
bacon

think
it
be
about
and
an
order
of
fry
about

a

water
they
only
sell
coke
and
i
do
not
drink
coke

i
have
crown
royal
in
it

it
seem
like
it
take
a
long
time
for
our
food
but
we
be
not
in
a
hurry
i
keep
hear
people
get
there
butt
spank

finally
come
my
single
be
pretty
big

the
bun
be
really
good
over
all
it

just
ok
the

i
visit

a
few
time

be
really
excited
when
dr

bring
the
concept
here
i
love
this

i
have
read
through
all
of
the
review
here
and
the
response
seem
to
indicate
people
who
do
not
get
it
this
place
unabashedly
be
what
it
be
if
you
do
not
like
it
go
somewhere
else
there
be
a
few
of
the
common
point
in
these
review
i
would
like
to
respond
to
price
i
think
this
place
be
very
reasonable
for
what
you
be
get
the
single
burger
be
a
half
pound
come
with
fry
and
run
about
it
about
more
than
a
large
mcdonald
value
meal
and
that
be
pay
for
the
atmosphere
and
a
better
overall
quality
of
food
burger
be
you
go
to
get
a
gourmet
burger
no
but
you
will
get
a
really
good
fast
food
burger
if
you
be
expect
a
star
burger
here
you
be
at
the
wrong
place
the
heart
attack
be
essentially
a
really
fun
upscale
fast
food
joint
think
innout
rather
than
gourmet
burger
do
you
get
to
choose
how
well
do
the
burger
be
or
what
kind
of
cheese
it
have
nope
but
you
ca
not
do
that
at
mcdonald
or
wendy
either
if
you
be
look
for
fancy
this
place
be
not
for
you
the
fry
i
like
the
taste
of
lard
cook
fry
have
since
i
be
a
kid
they
do
tend
to
be
a
little
soft
and
chewy
a
oppose
to
crisp
and
they
have
a
very
different
flavor
than
fry
cook
in
vegetable
oil
again
this
place
be
what
it
be
if
you
be
expect
mcdonald
style
super
crispy
fry
you
are
out
of
luck
but
give
this
a
try
and
you
may
find
you
enjoy
them

do
miss
the

imho
the
best
thing
on
the

i
prefer
the
vanilla
the
chocolate
one
use
actual
cocoa
powder
so
they
have
a
semisweet
dark
chocolate
kind
of
taste
which
i
find
a
bit
bitter
but
my
wife
love
just
scoop
the
little
pat
of
butter
out
of

definitely

definitely
nothing
special
about
it
a
a
matter
of
fact
they
advertise
how
bad
it
be
for
you
and
they
be
proud
of
it

you
do
not
go
there
for
the
quality

the
fun

that
be
ok
especially
if
you

some
guest
in

our
first
experience

actually
very
good
thanks
to
the
friendly
service
for
some
reason
they
only
accept
cash
and
their
hour
be
not
very
long
consider
they
be
on
the
busiest
place
in
vega
regardless
be
ready
for
a
fun
visit
especially
if
you
enjoy
watch
people
get
spank
for
not
finish
their
meal
or
even
better
if
you
like
to
be
on
the
receiving
end
and
those
spank
be
pretty
heavy
they
will
not
spare
you
if
you
can
handle
it

choice
be
very
limited

wacky

with
up

six

again
you

make
you
wear
hospital
gown

some

an

naughty

[
i
am
gon
na
have
to
chime
in
here
since
i
actually
enjoy
the
food
here
the
place
for
the
most
part
be
still
pretty
new
and
i
have
no
problem
with
the
service
here
the
novelty
of
the
place
be
funny
and
it
be
what
it
be
gimmick
with
the
hospital
gown
nurse
a
the
waitress
and
even
a
doctor
wander
about
though
there
be
some
word
of
warn
they
serve
unhealthy
food
that
the
point
nothing
be
healthy
here
so
why
would
they
serve
diet
soda
yea
they
have
water
now
because
restaurant
be
always
require
to
serve
it
but
you
have
to
buy
a
bottle
ok
it
sucks
it
just
a
regular
oz
bottle
of
water
you
can
get
a
big
case
of
for
like
at
a
grocery
store
so
be
a
major
ripoff
so
if
you
want
water
i
would
say
just
bring
in
a
bottle
of
your
own
not
sure
if
they
would
let
you
but
shoot
i
would
sneak
in
one
for
whatever
just
be
prepared
ahead
of
time
and
it
cash
only
another
downer
and
something
you
need
to
be
prepare
for
the
atm
there
charge
and
at
least
for
me
be
not
that
bad
though
it
best
if
you
remember
to
bring
in
cash
in
the
first
place
i
love
bacon
it
a
wonderful
thing
so
when
i
find
out
they
have
ton
of
it
in
their
burger
a
well
a
the
fry
be
fry
in
lard

be
excite

be
gross
out
about
that
sorry
you
can
go
elsewhere
and
the
butter
fat
shakes
again
it
unhealthy

course

again

gross
out

what
the

just
there

for

that

must
admit
that
it
lack
season

make
it
flavorless
and
boring
however
i
ca
not
dock
them

appeal

they
be
very
serious
about
after
eat
my
very
over
price

[
so
fun
and
so
super
full

start
off
with
the
fact
that
it
a
gimmicky
place
hello

vega
everything
be
gimmicky
when
you
walk
up
to
the
door
there
be
a
huge
scale
to
see
if
you
be
huge
enough
to
get
a
free
meal
most
people
like
to
step
on
it
for
fun
and
see
where
they
rank
but
a
a
chick
no
thanks
i
do
not
need
to
see
what
i
weigh
before
i
go
and
stuff
my
face
lol
you
be
give
a
scrub
top
hospital
gown
to
put
on
i
can
see
why
the
food
can
get
a
little
messy
our
server
be
awesome
she
be
this
tiny
petite
ball
of
fire
that
make
my
entire
dining
experience
when
she
first
come
over
to
great
she
quickly
inform
me
that
the
portion
be
a
good
size
and
that
there
be
punishment
if
you
do
not
finish
your
entire
meal
so
glad
she
do
too
cause
my
eye
be
once
again
go
to
be
bigger
then
my
stomach
i
get
the
chili
fry
and
a
single
burger
it
be
so
yummy
i
really
struggle
to
eat
it
all
because
i
do
not
want
the
spanking
that
come
with
not
finish
my
meal
i
get
to
watch
several
people
not
finish
and
those
gal
enjoy
give
them
a
spanking
not
just
a
little
love
tap
they
hit
hard
this
be
definitely
a
novelty
place
and
fun
to
experience
when
you
be
in
the
area
]
[
my
friend
have
hear
about
this
place
and
be
die
to
go
so
off
we
go
i
would
give
it
star
for
the
food
but
star
for
the
kitsch
factor
and
the
decadent
butterfat
shake
i
have
to
admit
it
kinda
fun
and
funny
to
walk
in
and
have
them
put
a
hospital
gown
and
bracelet
on
ya
they
also
spank
you
if
you
do
not
finish
your
food
which
be
pretty
comical
when
it
happen
to
my
friend
service
be
friendly
and
quick
too
which
be
nice
however
i
have
to
agree
with
a
lot
of
other
poster
that
the
food
itself
be
pretty
lack
here
the
burger
be
way
overdone
and
pretty
tasteless
unless
you
drown
it
in
condiment
the
fry
be
actually
crispy
and
well
do
but
nothing
i
would
run
back
for
anytime
soon
the
best
thing
on
the
menu
be
the
chocolate
shake
which
be
super
rich
and
creamy
if
you
go
i
would
skip
the
burger
get
a
shake
and
some
fry
and
just
enjoy
the
experience
]
[
ok
so
what
do
i
say
about
the
heart
attack
grill
well
i
will
start
by
say
that
this
be
a
very
touristy
place
it
be
not
somewhere
you
would
choose
to
go
to
every
day
of
the
week
if
you
be
a
local
lol
when
you
enter
you
be
greet
by
a
guy
in
medical
scrub
who
lead
you
to
a
little
dressing
area
where
you
be
give
hospital
patient
gown
to
put
on
then
you
be
lead
by
a
waitress
dress
a
a
nurse
to
your
table
the
nurse
then
give
you
your
very
limit
menu
the
option
be
a
pound
hot
dog
with
chilli
and
cheese
or
the
burgersyou
can
go
for
the
single
burger
with
cheese
and
chilli
or
you
can
opt
to
go
big
and
choose
the
double
or
triple
burger
with
extra
bacon
and
cheese
and
chilli
oh
do
i
mention
that
whatever
you
choose
to
order
you
must
finish
if
you
do
not
you
will
be
take
my
your
nurse
waitress
to
the
middle
of
the
restaurant
and
spank
with
a
large
wooden
paddle
lol
so
i
decide
to
play
it
safe
and
opt
for
the
single
burger
with
chilli
and
cheese
and
believe
me
i
be
glad
i
do
a
i
struggle
to
even
finish
thisbut
i
do
the
food
be
a
it
sound
greasy
fatty
and
extremely
salty
so
the
heart
attack
grill
be
the
perfect
name
for
this
place
i
could
feel
my
artery
clog
a
i
eat
lol
anyways
this
place
be
not
for
everyday
dining
but
if
you
be
visit
la
vega
for
a
holiday
this
be
a
must
try
placesuch
a
laugh
and
it
a
story
to
tell
the
only
reason
i
do
not
give
this
any
more
than
star
be
down
the
foodit
be
the
greasiest
burger
i
have
ever
have
to
eat
and
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
finish
it
if
it
be
not
for
fear
of
a
spanking
lol

[
sad
that
on
my
brother
last
night
in
vega
we
get
turn
away
an
hour
before
closing

they
only
have
server
work
that
suck
it
be
on
my
thing

do

at
all

[
try
the
triple
bypass
burger
with
bacon
it
be
fresh
and
tasty
add
salt
and
pepper
a
need
fry
be
great
and
shake
be
good

too
thick
for

it
down
with
a
oz
miller
highlife
must
try
just
for
the
experience

their
food
a
well
]
[
so
i
come
here
with
some
friend
recently
and
we
think
to
ourselves
hey
let
check
out
heart
attack
grill
this
restaurant
be
locate
on
fremont
st
the
fremont
street
experience
once
you
arrive
there
you
will
notice
a
huge
scale
in
front
of
the
entrance
apparently
if
you
weigh
lb
or
more
you
can
eat
free
but
anyways
a
we
walk
inside
the
hostess
dress
a
a
nurse
greet
you
and
give
you
a
patient
wristband
that
say
i
survive
a
bypass
heart
attack
grill
a
well
a
a
patient
gown
ps
you
return
those
gown
after
your
visit
too
bad
we
do
not
get
to
keep
them
a
a
souvenir
d
a
for
the
menu
for
drink
they
offer
shake
water
cola
and
alcoholic
drink
in
syringe
shot
my
boyfriend
want
to
try
the
chocolate
butter
fat
shake
the
appearance
of
it
be
enough
to
make
someone
lose
their
appetite
lol
but
it
taste
pretty
good
if
you
want
water
they
pretty
much
just
give
you
a
water
bottle
so
i
do
not
know
about
refill
we
both
order
the
single
bypass
cheeseburger
each
bypass
be
the
equivalent
of
a
burger
patty
i
think
the
most
you
can
order
be
a
quadruple
bypass
in
which
you
get
a
free
wheelchair
ride
by
the
waitress
nurse
the
burger
itself
be
good
but
nothing
too
special
we
also
have
the
chili
cheese
fry
which
be
also
delicious
be
forewarn
for
those
who
be
kinky
andor
enjoy
crime
punishment
if
you
do
not
finish
your
burger
you
be
entitle
to
spank
by
your
nurse
waitress
and
on
top
of
that
they
videotape
it
for
you
to
watch
at
home
on
their
main
website
pretty
cool
huh
it
look
pretty
painful
depend
on
the
nurse
waitress
you
get
some
hit
harder
than
others
one
of
the
customer
get
spanked
and
the
paddle
broke
lol
but
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
place
be
more
for
the
experience
rather
than
the
food
since
it
taste
like
any
other
burger
place
except
more
fattier
so
would
i
come
here
again
it
be
an
interesting
experience
but
one
heart
attack
be
good
enough
for
me

healthier
food

it
a
great

definitely
an
experience
eating
here

to
put
on
a

enter

really
give
you
that

do
not

get
spank
by
a

with
a
wooden
paddle

they
hit
hard
i
be
expect
it
to
be
a
cute
little
tap

they
really
do
wack
you
the
fact
that
you
have
to
get
a

actually
think
about
the
fact
that
you
will
be
spank

you
do
not

fun

a

get
up
on

get
a
free
burger

everyone
cheer
i
just
get
a
single
bypass
with
extra
bacon
and
fry
and
be
a
bit
underwhelmed
the
taste
be
not
distinguishable
it
taste
like
an
average
burger

i
try
some
of
my

chili
though

that
have
some
good
flavor

to
my
surprise
there
be
a
lot
of

around
i
be
confuse
about
what
the
kid
could
eat
a
full
half
pound
burger
seem
like
too
much
but
they
let
the
kid
share
and
i
suppose
it
a
fun
place
for
a
kid
to
be
conclusion
clearly
it
take
a
certain
type
of
person
to
enjoy
this
atmosphere
i
am
go
to
assume
that
you

that
kind

person
otherwise
why
would
you

when
you
do
get
it
the
thing
be
a
dry
out
piece
of
leather
perhaps
that
be
why
they
have
to
smother
it

right

the

just
a

an
inflated

tell

the

i
have
be
curious
to
try

the
first

die
there

this
past
weekend
i
be
finally
able
to
make
that
dream
come
true
it
not
on
strip

on
fremont
in
the
downtownold
strip
area
they
be
cash
only
theres
an
atm
inside
with
a
fee
which
be
the
cheapest
i
have
see
anywhere
in
vega
let
me
just
say
up
front
that
i
weigh
between
and
lb
depend
on
how
far
apart
my
last
meal
have
be
space
apart
and
be
no
where
near
the
lbs
you
need
to
be
to
eat
free
in
fact
i
am
no
where
near
what
an
average
person
of
my
height
should
weigh
to
be
normal
but
we
any
way
if
you
have
heart
problem
i
suggest
you
stay
at
least
a
mile
away
from
this
place
if
you
are
what
i
like
to
call
a
fairy
and
eat
small
portion
of
pretty
food
i
suggest
you
stay
away
from
this
place

you
are
what
i
like
to
call
an
elf
and
eat
gross
thing
like
vegetable
and
sprout

we
i
suggest
you
stay
away

you
do
come
in

keep
in

the
theme

the
place

are
gon
na
put
you
in

silly
hospital
gown
while
you
eat
and
all
the
waitress
be
dress
in
sexy

menu
be
simple

at

out

you
know

theres
cheeseburger

without

lucky
strike

all
a
half
pound

they
pile
the
cheese
and
onion
on
these

be
a
glutton

not
very
big
i
only
get
the
double
bypass
burger
yeah
they
are
name
like
that
sans
bacon
and
tomato
and
an
order
of
flatliner
fry
the
food
come
within
minute
and
after
look
at
the
burger
and
thinking
oh
crap
i
start
eat
the
burger
itself
be
pretty
good
definitely
not
the
best
and
no
where
near
a
good
a
a
gourmet
burger
but
better
than
any
fast
food
place

a
lot
of
small
burger
joint
i
be
really
surprise
by
the
quality
of
the
bun
now
if
i
have
get
just
the
single
bypass
this
might
have
be
a
completely
enjoyable
experience
but
i
do
not
so
about
half
way
through
the
burger
it
quickly
go
from
fun
to
wtf
by
the
last
quarter
i
be
start
to
fade
and
i
could
not
even
get
the
last
bite
down
now
normally
i
can
eat
a
burger
with
a
pound
of
meat
on
it
and
still
get
a
few
beer
in
the
biggest
problem
i
think
be
the
amount
of
cheese
near
the
end
it
be
just
too
heavy
so
i
threw
in
the
towel
after
some
research
i
find
out
that
their
biggest
burger
a
quadruple
bypass
with
bacon
come
out
to
over
calorie
meaning
that
the
double
without
bacon
be
somewhere
around
i
am
glad
i
do
not
find
that
out
till
after
either
way
i
might
come
back

just
not
into
it

i
at

the

upset
me

that

throw
my
card
on

the

say
that

me
mad

they
fail
to
explain
anything
to

there

even
have
the
nerve
to
say
yeah
we
have
a
sign
up

a
a

cheat
out

every
way

leave
me
nothing
to
recommend
nothing

regret

will
now
rate
the

give
a
unseasoned
meat
overcook

dry

ok

have
to
divide

wrestle
with
the
first
two

everything
above
them
for
round
one
and
then
the
last

everything
below
them
for

two

also
have
a
third
of
my
best
friend

milk
shake
and
some
french
fry
the
battle
last
about
a
half
hour
but
i
claim
victory
by
devour
the
entire
burger
there
a
large
metal
scale
at
the
restaurant
which
be
reminiscent
of
a
livestock
scale
that
people
sometimes
use
to
weigh
themselves
i
weigh
pound
before
the
feast
and
after
the
feast
i
weigh
pound

be
wheel
out
of
the

in
a
large
wheelchair

be
the
reward
you
get
for
eat
the
quadruple
bypass

believe
that
people
who
weigh
pound
or
more
eat
for
free
when
they
weighin
to
verify
their
weight
believe
it
or
not
i
am
usually
very
health
conscious
so
this
be
not
a
place
i
would
recommend
go
to
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
think
it
something
you
should
try
if
you
are
a
hardcore
foodie
and
you
do
not
have
high
blood
pressure
or
cardiovascular
disease

[
firstly
this
review
be
an
experience
and
be
not
rat
solely
on
just
the
food
we
arrive
and
be
greet
by
the
nurse
who
tell
to
gown
up
this
be
so
amusing
because
i
work
in
the
health
care
field
we
be
seat
and
give
a
menu
the
menu
be
hysterical
because
there
be
no
diet
drink
instead
their
be
food
which
be
give
the
common
stereotype
a
give
you
a
heart
attack
such
a
liquor
shot
in
prescription
bottle
energy
drink
huge
fatty
food
alcohol
in
iv
bag
with
your
custom
prescription
name
on
it
the
rule
be
that
if
you
weigh
more
than
lb
your
meal
be
free
they
actually
have
a
scale
you
also
have
to
finish
your
meal
and
if
you
fail
to
do
so
the
nurse
will
spank
you
literally
and
you
can
not
split
your
meal
with
someone
i
go
ahead
and
order
a
double
bypass
with
the
work
the
food
itself
be
pretty
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
just
a
regular
meaty
burger
you
can
find
at
most
burger
joint
but
do
not
let
that
discourage
you
the
place
itself
hold
a
solid
theme
and
i
believe
that
speak
louder
for
the
food
itself
again
it
all
about
the
experience
everyone
in
our
party
finish
their
meal
but
i
insist
for
the
nurse
to
spank
me
what
they
have
you
do
be
bend
you
over
and
grab
the
handle
bar
there
be
a
camera
facing
towards
your
face
which
broadcast
your
reaction
to
the
tv
all
over
the
restauraunt
i
am
be
complete
serious
when
i
say
this
but
i
feel
that
these
nurse
enjoy
their
work
and
really
whale
down
on
you
these
girl
slap
me
so
hard

i
have
to
call

am
a
tan
guy

i
walk
away
red
a
an
apple
with

perhaps
it
be
the
fact
that
i
try
to
be
kinky
and
insist
that
the
nurse
assault
me
that
cause
them
to
really
unleash
it
needle
to
say
the
experience
be
fun
for
everyone
our

be
extremely
friendly

intuitive
we
come
a
little
bit
after
opening

it
be
not

busy

rikki
our

sit
with

chat
a
bit

tell
about
herself

the

walk
in

promptly
greet
by
one
of
the
sexy
naughty
nurse

put
a
hospital
gown
on
me

ask
me
where
i

to
sit

alone

order

i
be

augment
my

an
order
of
flatliner
fry

be
cook
in
pure
lard

i
be
a
little
concerned
about
the
fry

think
be
cook
in
pure

just
make
them
greasy

actually
quite
tasty

my
favorite
part

definitely
have
better

me

not

fan
of

make
me
a
taste
of

not

it

true

once
i
finally
do
it
be
not
what
i
expect
at
all
it
be
around
pm
last

creep
me
out

since
it

require
i
obediently
put
on
the
gown
and
bracelet
and
walk
in
the
menu
here
be
quite
simple

have
type
of
burger

the
single
bypass

the
quadruple

coke
water
milkshake

a
variety
of
alcoholic
beverage
they
even
have
a
jello
shot
but
that
be
just
too
creepy
for
me
i
end
up
order
a
single
bypass
burger
with
a
side
of
fry
and
a
coke

wait

a
good
minute

the

from
the
outside

look
pretty
good
big
fat
drench
in
oil
bacon
and
chili
i
take
a
few
bite
and
i
honestly
do
not
like
the
burger
at
all
the
meat
have
little
flavor
dry
and
wayyy
too
oily
for
me
i
know
that
sound
pretty
contradictory
dry
and
oily
how
do
that
work
the
burger
patty
be
dry
but
the
oil
be
ooze
out
from
the
bun
chili
and
onion
surround
it
gross
and
the
whole
hospitallike
environment
do
not
help
either
it
make
it
sick
to
me
stomach
to
the
point
where
i
have
to
stop
eating
i
only
have
like
of
it
fry
i
am
a
hugeee
frenchfry
person
and
can
normally
eat
multiple
serving
of
it
at
other
restaurant
that
why
bottomless
fry
be
my
favorite
but
the
fry
serve
here
limp
greasy
and
soggy
from
the
oil
when
i
bite
into
them
gross
i
have
maybe
fry
and
i
just
have
to
stop
they
do
not
even
look
appeal
they
be
all
brownish
like
they
have
be
leave
out
for
a
while
and
not
freshly
cook

guess
the
whole
hospital
thing
be
what
they
be
go
for
even
all
the
staff
be
dress
up
a
either
nurse

decorate

honestly
the

suck

soooo
quiet

pretty
dead

have
some
music

play

that
do
not
see

all
the
depressing

it
seem
like
i
be
in
an
actual
hospital
the
only
good
thing
about
this

be
probably
the
vodka
milk
shake
i
have
a
sip
of
my

there

a

this

a

right

there
be
maybe
option
not
include
drink
everything
will
be
greasy
and
cook
in
fat

opt
for
the
single
bypass

it

juicy

a
way

will

you

weigh
myself

the
way
in

out

between
the
burger
and
pbr
i
gain
lb

guess
this
be
kind
of
the
point

eat
there

on

people
look
like
they
want
to
die

be
maybe
halfway
through
i
do
not
recommend
this
the
only
benefit
of
eat
the
giant
burger

that

you
finish

will
wheel
you

slightly
above

nothing

bland

out

ok
greasy

the

even
a

the
mistake

order
a

ever

i
take
my

if

fair

i
would

go
here
only

it

once

enjoyable
i
didnt
like
wear
that
stupid
robe
thingy
but
i
enjoy
their
food
the
only
thing
be
that
they
only
accept
cash
which
i
find
to
be
really
inconveinent
]
[
so
i
go
here
around
lunch
time
just
to
check
out
the
hype
i
ca
not
really
knock
this
place
because
they
set
out
what
they
intend
and
they
deliver
i
am
personally
not
crazy
about
this
place
but
if
your
really
hungry
and
want
to
get
full
with
a
heavy
burger
while
look
at
some
sexy
lady
then
this
be
exactly
the
place
i
would
go
a
far
a
to
say
it
a
little
above
average
hooter
just
with
slightly
better
food
i
only
get
a
single
patty
which
be
kind
of
pricy
but
i
can
see
how
you
can
save
a
little
cash
after
add
more
patty
or
bacon
because
it
only
like
a
buck
to
keep
stack
the
burger
i
do
like
the
fact
that
they
do
not
use
small
patty
or
bun
it
be
a
good
burger
but
nothing
i
could
not
just
get
at
red
robbins
the
day
i
go
we
get
good
service
so
no
complaint
there
the
nurse
we
have
frequently
check
up
on
to
see
how
we
be
do
and
if
we
need
any
condiment
it
be
true
about
the
spanking
and
how
hard
they
hit
i
do
not
receive
it
myself
but
you
can
tell
they
be
not
try
to
kill
you
but
they
put
effort
into
it
there
be
something
i
do
not
really
care
for
and
that
be
the
dcor
the
place
try
to
be
different
and
hospital
theme
but
it
come
off
lame
and
just
feel
bleh
i
think
that
need
to
be
change
one
other
problem
be
that
they
only
accept
cash
i
figure
they
would
be
establish
enough
to
be
able
to
take
card

i
guess
not
do
not
have
a
bad

you

fit
you
in
a
hospital

the
menu
be
simple
by

four
different
type
of
burger

brave
soul
attempt
the
quadruple

felt
like
the
burger
be
one
of
the
most
tasteless
burger
i
have
ever
try
the
fry
be
not
good
either
because
they
be
hard
and
not
season
well
there
be
also
a
catch
about
order
the
quadruple
bypass
burger
if
you
attempt
this
challenge
and
fail
a
nurse
will
come
over
and
punish
you
get
spank

would
not

that
a

punishment

my

himself

am
up
for
that
sure
it
offensive
but
all
in
good
humor
right
the
reality
be
that
the
burger
be
weirdly
precooked
and
char
they
are
absolutely
terrible
the
waitstaff
act
like
they
have
be
whack
upside
the
head
with
a
castiron
frying
pan
before
their
shift
they
all
live
in
fear
of
the
owner
the
worst
kind
of
lowlife
entrepreneur
who
seem
to
view
the
customer
and
public
a
his
enemy
and
the
police
a
his
personal
enforcer
see
the
other
review
for
example
the
whole
coronary
artery
disease
gimmick
and
yes
that
the
whole
joke
be
not
optional
you
play
along
or
get
kick
out
of
the
restaurant
so
you
have
really
crappy
food
and
anyone
who
say
otherwise
be
either
hire
by
them
or
have
never
have
a
decent
meal
in
their

the

funny
theme

of
a
heart
attack
at
ever
create
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
not
see
what
even
slightly
entice
about
it
other
than
it
prominent
location
at
the
end
of
fremont

[
like
some
other
reviewer
i
hear
about
this
place
and
be
curious
but
be
overall
disappointed
and
i
will
not
be
a
return
customer
my
boyfriend
and
i
each
order
a
single
fry
and
a
butterfat
chocolate
shake
the
shake
be
good
for
the
first
few
bite
then
it
be
just
too
rich
i
be
only
able
to
drink
about
of
it
and
the
bat
of
butter
that
come
on
top
gross
both
of
out
we
both
scoop
it
out
and
put
it
out
napkin
i
would
recommend
split
this
menu
item
the
burger
be
ok
i
really
love
the
bun
and
cheese
but
be
really
disappointed
that
the
burger
be
only
cooked
one
way
well
do
i
usually
enjoy
my
burger
raremedium
rare
so
for
me
the
burger
taste
like
charcoal
disappoint
from
a
burger
place

only
serve
burger
that
they
can
not
or
will
not
cook
them
at
different
temperature
the
french
fry
be
appal
we
each
take
one
bite
of
one
and
put
the
rest
of
it
down
they
be
soggy
and
limp
and
do
not
even
look
appetizing
we
also
order
a
bottle
of
water
for
me
and
a
bottle
of
coke
for
him
i
be
surprise
that
they
do
not
offer
free
water
from
the
tap
like
every
other
restaurant
my
boyfriend
do
enjoy
his
glass
bottle
of
coke
love
that
it
be
make
with
real
sugar
when
the
bill
come
for
both
quite
pricey
in
my
opinion
we
be
shock
that
we
could
not
use
a
debit
card
and
be
force
to
use
the
atm
in
their
lobby
area
grant
the
atm
only
charge
to
use
it
but
our
bank
charge
to
use
other
company

do
not

up

my

all
order
a

basket
of
fry

chilly
fry
the
fry
be
unbearably
salty
we
never
complain
so
we
wash
down
the

with
some
drink
but
the
chili
cheese
fry
order
remain
untouched
after
the
initial
bite
because
they
be
extremely
salty

tell
the
waitress
politely
that
the
chilly

be
salty

she
tell
me
she
could
not
take
it
off
that
we
would
still
get
charge
for
them
unless
we
speak
to
her

be
more
than
happy
to
talk
to
her

up

with
attitude

annoy
about

complaint
thalia
be
horrible
and
extremely
unprofessional
i
do
not
understand
how
a
fun
place
like
this
can
have
such
a
rude
and
unprofessional
manager
she
tell
that
she
could
not
take
it
off
the
order
because
the
waitress
would
have
to
pay
it
from
her
own
pocket
i
then
explain
to
her
that
it
be
not
our
fault
or
our
waitress
fault
that
the
chef
may
have
put
too
much
salt
on
the
fry
i
then
question
the
integrity
of
her
action
and
remind
her
that
what
she
just
say
be
against
labor
law
she
then
start
to
hesitate
and
change
her
story
and
start
to
blame
the
owner
and
how
they
get
in
trouble
when
i
tell
her
i

who

would
speak
to
a
customer
disrespectfully
it
even
more
disappointing
that
the

the

we
sit
down

about

they
arnt
aloud

ask
what

ca
not
discriminate
against
someone

one
which

reason

because

our
party

they
let

at
my
foot

do
his
job

really
be
the
last
straw
to
a
horrible
stay
in

i
do
not
think

be
look
forward

this
place
for
year

[
i
really
want
to
like
this
place
but
a
few
thing
keep
me
from
it
my
husband
and
i
go
for
dinner
while
visit
for
the
weekend
we
walk
in
and
we
put
the
hospital
gown
on
and
be
tell
that
if
we
do
not
finish
our
food
we
would
get
spank
this
be
not
a
surprise
since
we
read
up
on
the
place
before
arrive
our
waitress
be
extremely
kind
and
she
be
a
great
hostess
the
issue
i
have
be
with
the
security
guard
at
the
front
there
be
a
guy
that
be
extremely
sick
and
his
friend
take
him
to
the
bathroom
my
husband
be
a
nurse
practitioner
saw
the
guy
face
he
look
pale
and
be
sweat
bullet
my
husband
follow
the
guy
and
his
friend
into
the
bathroom
only
for
the
security
guard
to
come
and
say
if
the
guy
be
throw
up
that
he
would
need
to
leave
because
the
girl
would
not
be
clean
it
up
the
guy
friend
tell
them
that
the
guy
just
need
to
eat
but
the
guard
tell
him
they
have
to
get
him
out
of
there
my
husband
come
back
to
the
table
and
be
upset
that
no
one
care
about
the
welfare
of
the
customer
have
we
not
already
place
our
order
we
would
have
leave
this
be
unacceptable
you
should
never
treat
another
human
like
the
way
they
allow
the
security
to
treat
that
customer
the
guy
be
not
disturb
anyone
and
have
my
husband
not
go
to
check
on
him
we
would
have
not
know
what
be
go
on
what
if
something
happen
to
that
guy
that
situation
be
not
acceptable
i
am
sure
the
guard
will
say
the
guy
be
drunk
but
once
again
he
be
not
act
drunk
and
go
to
the
restroom
quietly
his
friend
be
not
cut
up
or
be
loud
so
there
be
no
reason
to
kick
them
out
this
be
a
liability
and
should
not
be
allow
my
husband
and
i
be
really
look
forward
to
this
place

after
that
incident

the

that

you
get

overall
most

come
just
for

they

hype
up

it
sound

it
be
fun

game
on
tv
but
when
you
get
to
the

it
more
like
disgruntle
employee
force
to
come
to
work
and
do
their
show

they
need
the
money
yeah
the
concept
be
funny

entertain

without

pointless

only
one

very

be
bland
too
much
bread

you
know
it
be
frozen

be
edible

it
not
bad

say
the
least
you
can
get
everything
on
the
burger

come
with
chili

again

to
stop
so
i
stick
with
the
regular
sized
burger
and
i
am
so
glad
i
do
the
burger
be
a
very
thin
patty
cook
way
past
well
do
and
could
have
be
use
a
a
hockey
puck
i
like
my
burger
thick
and
juicy
so
this
be
highly
disappointing
the
bacon
be
leave
on
the
grill
about
minute
too
long
a
well
and
the
burnt
texture
really
distract
from
the
rest
of
the
burger
my
gf
complain
it
be
by
far
the
worst
burger
she
have
ever
eat
and
i
disagree
with
that
but
only
because
i
have
eat
some
really
bad
burger
in
my
time
i
do
have
to
say
this
one
be
go
on
that
bad
list
though
the
condiment
on
the
table
mayo
kept
at
room
temp
be
scary
the
fry
be
super
greasy
to
the
point
they
be
soft
i
know
it
the
theme
here
but
come
on
guy
you
have
to
go
with
what
taste
good
over
what
be
the
most
unhealthy
thing
we
can
put
on
the
menu
and
i
be
disappoint
with
both
the
burger
and
fry
the
milk
shake
or
lard
shake
or
the
artery
clog
concoction
they
be
call
a
milklard
shake
taste
the
best
but
that
have
a
lot
to
do
with
the
fact
i
spend
the
last
hour
outside
on
fremont
street
watch
a
parade
and
the
coolness
of
texture
ooze
down
my
throat
yes
ooze
a
our
meal
last
about
min
and
the
shake
do
not
melt
much
you
can
only
guess
how
much
lard
they
use
to
make
the
buttermilk
shake
out
of
everything
this
be
the
best
but
my
suggestion
be
to
pick
the
vanilla
over
the
chocolate
one
a
it
be
just
too
rich
for
a
regular
person
pallet
the
other
thing
we
try
be
a
syringe
full
of
a
frozen
shotslushy
it
be
not
bad
either
and
i
wish
we
have
order
more
than
one
or
that
they
have
more
than
one
flavor
available
at
a
time
i
really
think
they
would
sell
more
of
these
thing
if
your
customer
could
each
order
a
flavor
and
pas
it
along
to
the
other
people
at
the
table
ok
so
now
the
experience
the
food
be
lack
in
taste
and
quality
so
why
be
this
place
so
crazy
popular
in
a
country
a
overweight
and
out
of
shape
a
the
usa
be
this
place
be
popular
because
if
you
weigh
a
certain
amount
you
eat
for
free
walking
in
you
be
greet
by
nurse
who
force
you
to
put
a
hospital
gown
on
and
walk
you
over
to
a
table
yes
the
staff
be
on
the
omg
hot
side
so
if
you
have
a
nurse
fantasy
this
be
a
good
place
for
you
and
guy
word
of
advice
be
your
girlfriend
ask
if
she
could
work
there
do
not
hesitate
just
say
yes
with
much
enthusiasm
a
she
be
judge
your
answer
and
response
time
oh
and
if
you
be
not
able
to
finish
your
burger
the
wait
staff
will
beat
you
with
a
wooden
paddle
after
what
happen
to
me
at
another
restaurant
i
be
more
than
happy
to
point
out
that
my
gf
do
not
finish
and
that
i
would
tip
extra
if
there
be
a
bruise
you
would
be
surprised
how
eager
they
be
to
whip
you
like
a
dog
my
gf
get
one
spank
for
every
bite
she
leave
so
keep
that
in
mind
once
ordering
yes
i
finish
mine
and
be
save
the
entire
set
up
be
a
bizzaro

hospital
there
be
no
healthy

if
you
have
some
big
hearty
eater
in
your
group
they
might
enjoy
try
to
take
down
a

all
in

you
can
easily
stand
on

outside

peek
through
the

to
see
everything
of
importance
just
take
my
word
for
it
you
will
be
sadly
disappointed
with
the
food
a
my
gf

i
be
all
in
all
our

be
expensive
we
do
buy
a

and
i
wo
not
mention
other
restaurant
by

but
if
you
want
a
burger
you
can
go
elsewhere
and
get
a
great
burger
at
a
huge

would
only
recommend
come
here

you

to

low

i
am
stick

quality
of

have
a

me
defend
my
star
rating
by

this

more
of
an
experience

i

the

around
the

near
what
some
would

we
pass
by

for

wonder
to
myself
if
anybody
actually
sit
in
that
chair
before
and
fit
the
chair

be
expect
a
fun
evening
especially
for
my
brother
who
just
turn
and
be
in
town
for
new
year
weekend
previously
i
have
stop
by
once
before
to
get
their
chocolate
shake
the
hostess
order
it
for
me
and
curiosity
get
the
best
of
me
so
i
have
to
ask
how
many
calorie
the
chocolate
shake
be
i
be
think
maybe
would
be
a
little
bit
close
to
my
expectation
of
unhealthy
but
it
be
double
that
amount
whop
calorie
for
what
ryan
h
describe

an
east
coast
frozen
custard
i
take
it
to
go
and
share
it
with
my
love
and
together
we
be
both
able
to
have
half
of
it
we
could
not
do
the
rest
they
advertise
that
it
pure
creme
i
do
not
mind
kill
myself
for
good
food
but
i
would
say
this
be
a
tad
bit
better
than
mediocre
to
the
dinner
we
have
the
triple
bypass
our
waitnurse
the
one
who
scratch
her
area
would
not
let
split
at
first
and
we
tell
her
that
we
have
already
eat
and
be
just
pass
by
and
want
to
try
them
so
she
allow
to
split
it
ourselves
grilled
onion
must
have
be
on
the
sideline
of
the
grill
for
a
while
because
they
sure
be
out
of
practice
and
do
not
do
their
part
they
be
lukewarm
and
have
no
flavor
not
even
anything
savory
the
bacon
somewhat
try
to
attack
but
they
need
more
of
a
defense
because
again
they
be
bench
player
bacon
strip
be
also
lukewarm
the
meat
be
not
a
seasoned
player
do
not
know
how
to
attack
and
the
sliced
tomato
be
not
sign
on
this
season
so
they
be
a
nogo
either
the
only
thing
that
attack
horribly
be
the
calorie
the
quadruple
bypass
be
calorie
accord
to
our
waitnurse
and
we
have
the
triple
so
minus
maybe
calorie
bring
to
about
calorie
split
between
the
three
of
well
i
do
not
do
bread
so
it
a
little
more
for
the
guy
we
also
order
coke
and
the
vanilla
shake
this
be
yummier
than
the
chocolate
shake

it
definitely
do
taste
like
butter
but
not
like
a
butter
popcorn
jelly
belly
a
someone
else
mention
in
their

would
like
to
add

for
the

it
have
it
should
taste
great

not
really
up

on
flash

make
a
trip

your
typical

again

of
the

he
park
ambulance
in
the

funny
stuff

far
inside

not
even
bother
stand
up
from
her
seat
behind
the
counter

we
make
it
clear
we
want
to
eat
weird
the
restaurant
be
very
empty
a
few
family
be
there

it
felt
very
cold
and
odd
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
it
be
christmas
eve
however
the
design
and
execution
of
the
place
just
be
not
welcome

even
amuse
it
bad
an
empty
bar

off

along

nice

do
not

crap

better

bottle
of

no

do
not

water

you
want
to
buy
a
bottle

we
envision
be
golden
and
crispy
like
mcdonald
back
in

day
heaven
right
wrong

be
limp

soggy

their
skin
on
not
tasty

the
texture
be
just
nasty

burger
be
okay
nothing
great
it
not
hard
to
make
a
decent
hamburger
the
cheese
slice

sandwich
slice
the
crease
from
the
individual
plastic
wrapper
impression
could
still
be

classy

the
dessert
of
choice
be
a
butter
fat
milkshake
vanilla

an
entire
bar
of
butter
blend
into
it
for
good
measure

share
and
eat
with
spoon

the
consistency
be
more
like
ice
cream
than
a
shake

so
about
half
way
we
decide
that
the
taste
of
butter
really
overpower
the
vanilla
that
be
not
a
good
thing

i
finally
put
my
finger
on
it

this
taste
exactly
like
a
buttered
popcorn
jelly
belly

signal
the
end

that
be
what
they
taste

gross

to

the
two

not
take

the
cheapass
asian
place
in
alhambra
be
the
only
one
that
pull
that
crap
these

anyway

pay

walk
out

be
fine

around

interact

lively

just
walk
back

forth

have
it
heat
up

it
good

go
right
we
send

the

manager
in
back
tell
the

to
tell

it
hot

if

want
a

we
have
to
buy

you
cant
even

have
small
plate

ask

after
the

time
of
tell

that
we
be
okay
with
just
water

the

also
give
attitude
when
we
ask
if
we
could
split
the

three

vinegar

be
a
little
too
tangy

would
put
more
cheese
to
balance
out
the
vinegar
it
have
also
an
odd
texture

remind
me
of
dice
up
asian
beef
jerky
black
rice
and
oxtail
risotto

advise
to
mix
the
dish
up
thoroughly
before
eat
there
be
a

a
pretty
sharp

whatever
cheese
they
use
it
nice

also
brown
the

the

the

it

smell
exactly

flatbread

i
can
say
be
the

be
super
on
point
there
be
an
hour
wait
but
so
worth
it
i
have
to
highly
recommend
the
bacon

just
wow
the
veal
meatball

[
a
good
place
to
come
eat
and
chat
with
friend
we
come
with
empty
stomach
on
a
monday
afternoon
around
on
labor
day
to
try
the
place
we
have
see
so
many
review
about
we
be
seat
right
away
and
be
attend
to
promptly
service
be
good
but
the
portion
be
very
small
compare
to
the
price
we
pay
and
some
of
the
stuff
be
a
bit
salty
but
the
flavor
be
good
we
order
tempura
green
bean
this
be
the
absolute
surprise
of
the
day
tempura
green
bean
be
exactly
how
they
sound
but
the
pepper
jelly
cream
cheese
they
serve
it
with
be
so
good
the
creaminess
of
the
cheese
with
the
sweetness
of
the
pepper
jelly
compliment
the
mild
flavor
of
the
green
bean
although
a
bit
oily
for
me
it
be
nevertheless
my
favorite
dish
good
portion
cocoa
expresso
crust
steak
it
be
very
salty
in
my
opinion
the
crust
itself
be
very
salty
on
the
end
piece
but
for
the
middle
slice
it
work
well
the
meat
be
good
i
would
have
prefer
it
a
bit
more
rare
but
it
be
good
the
way
they
serve
it
rabbit
ragu
this
be
very
good
the
rabbit
be
cook
well
with
crunchy
piece
of
pancetta
or
be
it
rabbit
either
way
the
sauce
work
well
with
the
meat
and
compliment
the
spaghetti
squash
portion
be
super
small
in
my
opinion
for
the
dollar
i
pay
if
i
really
crave
it
i
would
order
it
again
but
i
think
i
will
opt
for
something
else
next
time
hawaiian
flat
bread
flatbread
serve
with
spiced
rum
pineapple
and
ham
sprinkle
with
chive
it
be
alright
the
pineapple
be
delicious
it
be
a
very
bold
and
sweet
flavor
the
ham
however
be
salty
and
overpower
the
pineapple
which
be
a
shame
also
a
bit
pricey
but
it
vega
so
i
ca
not
say
anything
there
overall
it
be
a
good
experience
good
food
although
a
bit
salty
and
great
customer
service
will
be
back

try
other
food

bad

[
after
my
second
mediocre
experience

review

may

why

at
this

the
other
seating

at

your
leg
dangle
while
you
sit
in
their
uncomfortable
bar
chair
the
first
time
i
eat
here
we
be
seat
at
the
actual
bar
and
while
it
be
very
loud
in
the
restaurant
i
be
able
to
enjoy
my
friend
company
on
my
second
trip
here
we
be
seat
at
the
share
table
across
from
a
couple
who
have
their
tongue
down
each
other
throat
the
whole
time
and
a
father
who
be
lecture
his
daughter
loudly
on
how
to
make
it
in
the
business
world
and
she
better
shape
up
or
ship
out
i
understand
this
be
not
within
the
restaurant
control
however
i
would
certainly
prefer
to
have
an
option
rather
than
share
dining
but
a
a
party
of
two
we
be
not
afford
that
luxury
service
the
first
visit
they
be
busy
but
by
sit
at
the
bar
we
be
able
to
flag
down
the
bartender
to
get
our
order
relatively
fast
the
second
visit
i
arrive
first
and
my
server
ask
if
i
would
like
to
wait
to
order
i
inform
him
i
would
order
before
my
companion
arrive

i
need
a
minute
to
look
over
the

him
to

awkwardly
around

for
a
drink
with

down

up

have
find
the
right
place

inside

will

area

will
have
two
option

up

else

the

cold

i

there
be
something
addictive
about
it

i
could
not
stop
eat
it
either

wish
there

more

a
small
puddle
in

i
could

i
wish
the
jam
be
just
a
bit
le
sweet

more
smokey
more
brie
would
definitely
improve
this

would

the
toast

dry

my
preference
create
too
crunchy
of
a
surface
that
do
not
absorb
any
of
the
jam

price
the
crispy
chicken
skin
be
a
decadent
fry
treat
accompany
by
a
honey
dip
sauce
the
skin
themselves
be
delicately
fry
so
that
the
coating
do
not
overpower
the
taste
of
the
skin

in
the
honey
they
be
very
good

do
not
carry
ranch

offer
a
hot
sauce
similar
to
frank
hot
sauce

a
a

go
there
a
we
stay
at
the
d
and
walk
over
we
have
read
really
good
review
online
so
wanted
to
try
it
out
i
get
the
jerk
turkey
burger
with
tater
tot
good
big
and
filling
my
buddy
get
the
osso
bucco
do
not
get
this
it
be
two
piece
mostly
bone
and
fat
a
lot
of
fat
one
piece
be
so
fatty
they
should
have
be
embarrass
the
bartender
be
very
knowledgeable
about
the
food
how
it
be
prepare
and
such
that
be
nice
we
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
bartender
and
his
response
be
that
osso
bucco
right
we
really
do
not
like
his
response
you
get
nothing
with
it
but
the
osso
bucco
and
there
be
nothing
hardly
to
eat
and
it
be
but
the
turkey
burger
be
good
although
it
be
i
believe
a
gal
near
at
the
bar
get
some
tempura
green
bean
that
look
really
good
i
think
those
be
we
each
get
a
dessert
i
love
sweet
i
get
the
brownie
with
the
butter
bacon
ice
cream
the
brownie
be
cold
and
rock
hard
they
should
microwave
it
warm
then
add
the
ice
cream
i
would
not
get
that
again
and
it
cost
the
glazed
donut
bread
pudding
be
good
though
get
that
but
share
with
someone
a
one
be
enough
for
two
people
besides
it
cost
a
well
but
get
it
and
share
it
oh
and
there
be
only
a
few
table
the
smallest
be
for
people

i
go
in
there
on
a
saturday
at
around
pm
it
be
crowd
and
we
be
place
at
a
long
table
with
other
diner
i
order
the
crispy
chicken
skin
with
smoked
honey

rocoto

my
son
do
not
like
them
the
shrimp
be
bread
and
lightly
fry
and
then
douse
with
this
pepper
cream
a
little
too
spicy
for
me
the
bacon
jam
i
do
not
like
but
my
son
do
i
think
that
the
bacon
jam
be
overprice
for
what
you
get
the
one
thing
i
do
really
like
be
the
butter
burger

then
again
the
tater

a
little
on
the
too
spicy
side

also
order
a
sangria

be
average

if
you
want
to
come
here
come
here
not
hungry

order
a
drink
and
an
appetizer

just
enjoy
the
company

predate

the
waiter

in
a
rush

get
out

someone
else
could
sit
down
i
do
not
care
for
that
the
round
bowl
dish
bother
me
because
when
they
bring
food
out
in
them
the
server
have
their
thumb
in
the
bowl
to
hold
it
i
would
get
different
serve
dish
instead
of
those
bowl

[
so
this
review
be
actually
super
difficult
for
me
to
write
i
love
the
food
but
be
le
than
satisfy
with
the
service
a
other
yelpers
have
mention
it
be
extremely
difficult
to
find
it
be
a
great
place
to
visit
off
strip
but
just
know
it
will
be
a
bit
of
a
hike
if
you
do
not
have
a
car
in
addition
be
ready
to
pay
for
park
meter
and
street
parking
can
be
extremely
hard
to
come
by
so
you
may
need
to
pay
for
a
spot
in
a
lot
good
news
about
this
though
if
you
choose
to
walk
around
fremont
after
dinner
you
wo
not
have
to
fee
the
meter
the
food
so
delish
be
ready
to
split
a
lot
of
thing
with
your
family
andor
friend

definitely
the
best
way
to
go
when

kitchen
a
unhealthy
a
they
probably
be
the
crispy
chicken
skin
be
to
die
for
so
delish
i
also
be
a
sucker
for
good
green
bean
they
be
definitely
fabulous
in
addition
i
love
the
scallop

really
ca
not
go
wrong
with
anything
on
the
menu
the
only
item
we
try
that
we
be
not
huge
fan
of
be
the
crab
fondue
it
just
be
not
really
our
style
the
bar
service
be
what
kill
my
group
the
run
joke
be
we
have
to
order
our
next
drink
when
our
drink
arrive
a
it
take
that
long
for
to
get
fresh
one
this
could
have
just
be
a
busy
night
or
something
however
it
be
disappoint
to
my
group
that
they
would
have
to
wait
a
while
for
their
next
drink
definitely
would
come
back
to
this
place
it
seem
like
their
menu
change
up
quite
a
bit

extremely
interested

see
what
they
come
up
with

better
than

of
tenderness
of
the
meat

flavor
we
also
get
the

me
praise
the

to
the
high
heaven

do
not

to
just
drink

koolaid

ernest
in
their
desire
to
make
sure
we
be
comfortable
and
happy
with
our
food
they
seem
to
have
actually
taste
most
of
the

have
good
recommendation
for
much
like
la

i
would
eat
here
again

of
what
i
thought
of

the

make
the
experience
worthwhile

i
do
not
care
for
the

the

we
split
oxtail
risotto

honestly
be
so
rich
a
to
be
offputting

eat
maybe
four
spoonful

my

be
plenty

delish

little
go
a
long
way
a
very
long
way
again
we
pass
on
take
the
extra
home
the
empanadas
be
fill
with
nice
chunky
meat
that
be
tender
though
it
could
have
be
a
tad
juicier
the
mushroom
flatbread

a
great
appetizer

the
pizza
cook
be
lot
of
fun
without
be
overly
familiar
here
my
issue

it
something
you
can
actually
see
in
the
accompanying
picture
the
risotto
and
jam
seem
to
be
swim
in
something
it
be
not
grease
maybe
some
oil
like
truffle
the
lake
of
whatever
it
be

not
inspire
one
to
want
to
deal
with
that
in
a
to
go
box
or
when
it
inevitably
congeal
again
offputting

the
only
word
i
can
find
to
describe
my
feeling
about
it
it
really
be
not
greasy

slimy

it
look
that
way
combine
with
the
fact
that
everything

the

rich

not

there
not
much
around

use
for

it
across
the
street
from
an
empty
lot
and
while
there
not
much
around
to
look
at

be
a
simple
charm

the
rooftop

cool
winter
night
in

the
staff
be
friendly

identify
by
the
band
tee

they
are

wear

honest
about
food
selection

steer
away
from
the
root
beer

do
make
a
mistake
with
regard
to
our
drink
order
but
we
end
up
with
a
free
beer
so
i
can
not
complain
the
food
be
rustic
small
plate
style
and
meant
to
be
share
there
be
three
of
so
we
sample
a
few
item
the
bacon
jam
we
agree
be
by
far
the
star
attraction
it
rich
and
flavorful
and
even
though
you
feel
guilty
you
will
have
trouble
share
the
devil
egg
be
also
quite
good
but
go
in
a
flash
a
far
a
the
larger
item
the
butter
burger
be
actually
quite
good
it
come
with
tater
tot
which
be
decent
but
it
hard
to
mess
up
tater
tot
the
mac
and
cheese
be
rich
and
creamy
but
neither
mind
blowing
or
disappointing
the
mushroom
flatbread
be
however
disappointing
and
so
be
the
risotto
the
flatbread
uninspired
small
and
distinctly
miss
any
rich
flavor
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
the
oxtail
risotto
be
so
overpowered
with
parmesan
cheese
there
be
not
room
for
any
other
flavor
we
drink
our
desert
the
beer
selection
be
actually
fairly
good
and
nontraditional
i
try
two
of
the
mixed
drink
and
each
be
well
prepared
a
nice
touch
at
the
end
of
the
meal

how
the
check
arrive
in
a
book
which
invite
you
to
leave
an
autograph

all
into

think
i
will
try
this
kitchen
again
at

once
more
for
the
bacon
jam
i
do
take
some
point
away

however
three

if

you
do
not
really
want

maybe
go
elsewhere
that
night
it
a
little
pricey
for
the
small
portion

that
the
in
thing
we
order
pork
osso
buco
definitely
tender
fall
of
the

it

lack

most
of

fairly
simply
with
garlic

this
dish

could
have
be
better
with
more
browning
on

floret
the
texture
be
a
little
mushy
for
my
taste
but
flavorwise
it
be
very
nice
finally
we
decide
that
something
sweet
be
in
order
and
since
we
have
a
good
size
party
we
just
go
with
one
of

three

bourbon
fudge
brownie
deep
rich
chocolate
flavor
with
a

note
combine
with
a
tender
almost
creamy
texture
make
this
one
very
popular
at
the
table

the
brownie
be
not
even
the
best
part
the
stun
brown
butter
bacon

cream
might
have
be
one

the

face
donut
i
have
to
tell
you
though
we
go
today
at
lunch
and
i
think
we
be
exceedingly
lucky
that
we
walk
in
and
be
able
to
sit
at
a
table
there
be
one
table
that
be
be
save
for
somebody
with
reservation
and
everything
else
be
literally
full
it
be
a
tiny
little
spot
but
it
be
fantastic
we
start
with
the
wellington
empanadas
which
be
fantastic
we
then
order
the
fried
green
tomato
sandwich
with
crab
and
the
short
rib
slider
both
come
with
spicy
tater
tot
the
tater
tot
be
not
too
spicy
you
could
definitely
detect
some
paprika
and
they
be
quite
good
the
short
rib
slider
be
quite
sweet
the
menu
do
say
that
they
be
root
beer
short
rib
slider
so
take
note
of
that
because
they
be
sweet
but
the
slider
be
fantastic
the
sweetness
be
offset
by
a
crispy
onion
that
be
put
on
the
slider
if
i
have
one
note
it
would
be
to
put
a
little
bit
more
crispy
onion
to
offset
that
sweetness
the
fried
green
tomato
sandwich
with
crab
be
the
star
the
tomato
be
very
thickly
cut
and
expertly
bread
the
breading
have
a
nice
spice
to
it
overall
it
be
a
fantastic
meal
it
a
little
pricey
for
lunch
but
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
you
get
and
then
you
understand
the
price
tag
for
two
people
at
lunch
i
would
love
to
go
back
i
hope
i
get
lucky
again
and
get
a
table

for
me
be
the
fry
chicken
skin
and
honey
the
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
salty
i
be
really
impress
by
the
fish
fillet
sandwich
also
so
goooood
if
you
are
look
for
something
delicious
with
a
really
cool
atmosphere
that
will
not
break
the
bank
you
should
definitely
come
check
out
carson
kitchen
i
ca
not
wait
to
come
back

[
the
place
be
a
little
small
but
that
be
to
be
expect
in
this
part
of
town
i
think
because
of
the
threat
of
rain
the
upstairs
patio
section
be
close
make
the
dining
room
really
crowd
i
be
not
expect
the
whole
family
style
seat
they
do
not
take
reservation
so
we
call
ahead
to
put
our
name
on
the
list
a
the
hostess
recommend
we
be
seat
about
minute
after
arrival
on
a
saturday
night
so
that
be
pretty
good
it
be
really
too
crowd
to
wait
inside
while
wait
outside
a
dude
keep
walk
up
and
down
the
street
crazily
shout
profanity
at
nobody
so
that
add
some
color
to
that
part
of
the
evening
again
this
be
sort
of
to
be
expect
in
this
part
of
town
when
we
be
seat
it
be
at
the
bar
i
be
not
expect
this
but
we
think
it
be
fun
if
you
be
seat
at
the
bar
be
prepare
for
people
order
drink
over
your
head
and
handing
over
payment
next
to
your
food
the
bar
tender
be
also
our
server
so
there
be
not
much
discussion
of
the
menu
just
you
guy
want
food
he
be
very
nice
and
good
at
his
job
but
between
the
noise
level
and
him
try
to
make
drink
for
the
entire
restaurant
i
do
not
really
feel
able
to
ask
any
question
about
the
menu
i
do
have
some
but
oh
well
on
to
the
food
awesome
i
have
the
killer
shrimp
which
be
nice
and
spicy
along
with
the
pork
belly
cuban
i
think
the
cuban
be
a
little
heavy
on
the
yellow
mustard
along
with
the
pickle
give
it
a
sort
of
mcdonald
cheeseburger
flavor
profile

it
would
have
be
the
best
mcd

there
you
go

really
good

some
gin

right
up
his
alley

he
really
love
it
the

definitely
star
quality

i
knock
off
a

for
the
whole
over
crowded
feel
of
the
place

not
have
a
real

it
would
be
nice

have
have
a
table

someone

talk
to
about
the
food

order

you
the
option

you

the
vodka
that
they
suggest

a
variety

have
never
hear
before
and
i
know
my
vodka
i
be
excite
to
come
back
and
try
the
large
variety
of
menu
item
and
liquor
we
start
with
the
tempura
green
bean
which
be
a
little
on
the
cold
side
probably
because
it
be
so
cold
outside
but
i
really
enjoy
the
aioli
dip
sauce
we
next
try
the
slider
which
be
very
flavorful
and
tasty
definitely
one
of
my
more
favorite
item
we
receive
the
tater
tot
at
the
same
time
and
they
be
not
anything
special
but
who
be
i
to
complain
about
deepfried
spud
i
am
all
in
we
also
try
the
rainbow
cauliflower
which
be
so
unique
and
i
love
the
vinegar
sauce
it
be
toss
in
the
crispy
chicken
skin
with
honey
be
so
interesting
and
tasty
we
also
try
the
bacon
jam
which
be
so
so
unique
i
probably
would
not
order
that
again
but
i
be
glad
i
try
it
again
it
be
a
tad
on
the
cold
side
probably
because
it
be
so
chilly
outside
we
also
get
potato
with
garlic
which
if
you
put
garlic
on
anything
i
will
love
it
but
the
best
item
we
receive
be
the
bread
pudding

pudding
be
make
with
donut
from
nearby

additionally
the
fried
chicken

be
a
great
appetizer
the
only
thing
i
will
say
be
that
the
cocktail
be
below
average
they
taste
too
weak
and
even
when
i
order
a

typically
stick

i
would
have
easily
give
them

now
that
i
have
din
there
several
more

i
feel
like
there
be
a
bit
of
complacency

have
result
in
the
restaurant
go
downhill
a

both
it

quality

with
the

chef
kerry
simon
develop
the
original
menu
and
when
they
first
open
they
discuss
how
the
menu
would
change
over
time
and
that
thing
would
come
and
go
for
variety
i
totally
respect
that
and
think
it
be
refresh
we
order
the
spam
croquettes
on
our
first
visit
and
unfortunately
it
be
one
of
the
first
thing
to
be
remove

never
come
back
other
item
we
have
try
over
the
time
we
have
be
there
be
the
bacon
jam
the
chicken
skin
the
risotto
taco

many
others
it
seem
like
the
fryer
have
be
in
overdrive
lately
a
the
fried
item
be
simply
too
over
fry
the
bacon
jam
be
heavily
seasoned
and
though
some
grease
be
expect
it
be
take
to
the
extreme
we
prefer
to
dine
upstairs
on
the
patio
and
when
it
be
available
we
always
request
it
nice
view

a
peaceful
modern
setting
the
din
area
downstairs
be
a
bit
cramped
and
a
little
too
hipster
modern
for
our
taste
the
hostess
be
friendly
enough
but
also
seem
a
bit
agitate
at
time
refill
on
drink
and
water
tend
to
be
pretty
slow
and
my
biggest
complaint
no
refill
on
soda
and
no
draft
beer
a
they
do
not
have
a
soda
fountain

really
do
not
like

i
can
deal
with
it
when
the
food

make
up
for
it
unfortunately

fall

i
agree

overhyped

do
not
recommend
this
place
if
you
be
a
vegetarian
or
health
conscious
the
bacon
jam
taste
good
but
visually
be
not
appeal
due
to
it
blackish
color
and
even
a
little
gross
because
it
be
marinate
in
it
fat
the
lamb
in
the
gyro
be
dry
out
so
much
so
that
even
the
yogurt
sauce
do
not
cover
up
the
dryness
the
pita
bread
be
moist
and
tasty
though
and
i
have
to
wonder
whether
this
would
do
better
a
a
vegetarian
dish
the
two
dish
i
really
enjoy
be
the
cuban
although
do
it
really
need
to
be
pork
belly
and
the
mac
and
cheese
both
be
flavorful
and
moist
however
i
ca
not
in
good
conscious
give
more
than
star
since
this
be
only
half
the
dish
and
i
ca
not
imagine
the
calorie
cost
to
achieve
those
flavor
i
ca
not
ignore
that
the
mac
and
cheese
probably
have
a
stick
of
butter
and
pound
of
cheese
mixed
with
only
ounce
of
pasta
i
ca
not
ignore
that
the
cuban
probably
have
slice
of
cheese
on
buttered
slice
of
toast
just
because
i
choose
to
eat
out

not

i
want
to
eat
a

out

[
i
call

i
be
not
sure
if
they
do
happy
hour
they
do
not
i
then
ask
to
make
a
reservation
mainly
because
i
know
first
friday
evening
pack
everything
in
down
town
they
do
not
take
reservation
for
a
party

apparently
that
too
small
for
them

if
it

differently

a
different

still
go

we
plan
to
try
with
friend
who
have
also
never
be
i
also
live
in
downtown
so
i
be
always
curious
of
the
culinary
scene
they
take
your
name
down
how
many
in
your
party
tell
you
the
wait
time
and
then
to
come
back
they
do
not
take
your
number
they
do
not
call
or
they
do
not
text
i
find
this
frustrating
something
need
to
be
do
about
this
after
have
to
wander
around
down
town
and
make
many
lap
in
this
blazing
heat
we
finally
be
seat
i
have
to
say
star
for
the
service
from
our
waitress
wish
i
could
remember
her
name
she
be
so
nice
and
pleasant
and
very
suggestive
we
order
many
thing
a
our
appetite
grow
the
deviled
egg
with
caviar
be
great
the
gyro
taco
ok
the
fried
chicken
skin
good
do
not
care
for
the
jam
butter
with
bread
the
turkey
mango
burger
be
sweet
the
tarter
tot
be
delicious
i
would
come
back
again
when
it
slow
or
if
i
have
a
large
party
enough
for
this
restaurant
to
take
my
reservation
again
my
only
complaint
i
have
be
my
experience
about
the
whole
reservation
thing
and
no
text
or
call
back
not
even
a
buzzer
]
[
so
i
finally
have
the
chance
to
visit
carson
kitchen
in
downtown
la
vegas
a
few
week
ago
for
lunch
i
have
really
like
kerry
simon
previous
restaurant
simon
kitchen
bar
at
the
hrh
so
i
figure
that
his
newest
restaurant
near
the
downtown
container
park
would
be
pretty
good
and
my
thought
be
that
they
do
not
disappoint
the
decor
out
of
upon
enter
the
restaurant
which
seem
to
have
some
lower
ceiling
it
seem
to
not
have
that
much
of
a
din
area
beyond
a
few
table
the
bar
area
and
seating
near
the
kitchen
however
they
do
have
a
larger
area
upstairs
on
their
rooftop
patio
which
i
think
would
be
great
for
party
the
restaurant
be
kind
of
dimly
lit
but
with
plenty
of
accent
lighting
in
the
bar
area
and
in
the
kitchen
so
i
kind
of
like
it
it
have
a
hip
but
intimate
vibe
to
it
they
also
have
an
outdoor
patio
area
where
we
wait
for
a
couple
of
seat
to
open
up
which
be
nice
although
that
might
get
a
little
hot
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
the
service
out
of
so
after
a
short
wait
outside
on
that
patio
we
be
seat
at
a
couple
of
chair
that
be
immediately
adjacent
to
the
kitchen
where
we
be
literally
a
few
foot
away
from
one
of
the
prepsous
chef
not
exactly
sure
what
her
title
be
so
just
go
with
me
here
our
server
explain
that
many
of
their
dish
be
of
the
shareable
kind
and
be
attentive
to
our
need
when
we
need
a
refill
etc
the
food
out
of
and
what
do
i
think
about
the
food
i
think
that
it
be
delicious
we
have
a
couple
of
social
plate
of
the
bacon
jam
which
be
awesome
and
i
wish
that
they
would
jar
that
stuff
up
because
i
would
buy
a
few
jar
of
it
if
they
do
and
the
devil
egg
with
crispy
pancetta
caviar
i
like
it
although
i
think
that
i
would
have
like
to
have
have
the
pancetta
more
thinly
chop
my
preference
then
i
have
the
pork
belly
cuban
sandwich
which
come
with
spicy
tator
tot
which
be
great
and
come
with
tasso
ham
manchego
cheese
next
time
i
am
go
to
try
the
crispy
chicken
skin
and
the
black
rice
oxtail
risotto
which
a
really
good
friend
of
mine
also
another
foodie
say
be
really
good
overall
out
of
overall
i
think
that
carson
kitchen
be
more
like
a
out
of
but
since
yelp
do
not
offer
any
rating
i
decide
to
give
it
star
a
star
just
be
not
quite
enough
so
if
you
are
look
for
some
really
good
food
i
would
highly
suggest
check
out
carson
kitchen
a
it
be
now
my
goto
spot
downtown

i
be
slightly
skeptical
about
how
awesome
this
place
could
possibly
be
it
seem
every
time
something
new
open
downtown
it
get
rave
review
and
then
sort
of
fall
of
the
map
however
it
definitely
live
up
to
the
hype
we
sit
at
the
bar
and
be
serve
by
andrew
who
be
extremely
knowledgeable
and
friendly
order
cocktail
delicious

the
chicken
skin
and
devil
egg
which
be
both
incredible
i
ca
not
wait
to
go
back
for
a
full
meal
the
only
thing
that
be
keep
me
from
give
star
be
how
hot
it
be
in
the
restaurant
i
realize
they
have
an
open
kitchen
and
that
it
be
degree
yesterday
but
it
be
notably
uncomfortable

[
we
go
on
a
friday
so
it
be
pack
and
have
a
min
wait
we
wait
in
the
bar
area
and
when
two
seat
open
up
at
the
bar
we
go
to
go
sit
there
but
be
tell
they
use
the
bar
a
regular
dinner
service
area
so
we
go
back
to
sit
on
the
window
sill
we
end
up
be
seat
at
the
bar
anyway
and
we
order
four
item
they
bring
food
out
when
it
ready
a
oppose
to
bring
it
all
out
together
they
forget
our
salad
so
we
cancel
it
and
order
a
dessert
instead

that
be
take
a
long
time
so
we
cancel
that
too
the
mac
cheese
be
amazing

so
be
the
tempura
green
bean

not
good

[
come
here
for
dinner
on
a
sunday
night

it
be
quite
busy
call
ahead

be

on
the
waitlist

still
wait
about
min
once
we
get
there

there
be
some
seat
around

cozy
fire
pit
out
back
where
we
enjoy
a
project
idaho
and
simonsays
sangria
both
be
excellent
we
be
finally
seat

do
not

be
part
of
dinner
seating
our
bartenderwaitress
be
awesome
din
space
a
little
tight
at

i
would
probably
request
a
table
next
time

share
the
bacon
jam
gyro
taco

the

up

the
bacon
jam
be
too
good
to
stop
the
taco
taste
greek

still
felt
like
a
taco
if
that
make
any
sense
the
sea
bass
be
excellent
tender

you

very

remove
the

from

fry
them

more

would
be
able
to
sample
just
about
everything
by
now

that
be
just
too
good

up

not

devil
egg
basically
devil
egg
with
a
sprinkling
of
black
caviar
and
crunchy
pancetta
bit
replace
the
paprika
i
love
devil
egg
and
this
version
taste
okay
but
i
could
not
help
think
that
real
devil
egg
have
more
flavor
because
of
the
spice
from
the
paprika
this
version
be
just
salty
and
the
egg
filling
be
a
little
on
the
dry
side
a
well
the
pancetta
be
the
best
part
the
caviar
do
not
have
much
of
a
flavor
impact
i
think
i
would
have
be
more
impressed
with
the
dish
if
they
have
replace
the
black
caviar
with
japanese
fly
fish
roe
or
salmon
roe
and
add
a
drop
of
spicy
sauce
a
well
because
japanese
roe
have
that
poppy
texture
that
be
miss
with
the
black
caviar
plus
it
orange
so
the
presentation
would
be
more
exciting
more
of
a
play
on
the
traditional
deviled
egg
roast
beet
salad
the
description
sound
good
but
the
flavor
do
not
meld
well
for
me
besides
the
beet
it
have
mandarin
orange
goat
cheese
pistachio
i
think
it
would
have
taste
better
if
the
beet
be
slice
thinner
instead
of
in
big
chunk
and
maybe
if
the
pistachio
be
replace
with
candied
walnut
or
pecan
rainbow
cauliflower
i
prefer
roast
cauliflower
to
whatever
they
do
to
this
cauliflower
roast
cauliflower
be
more
tender
and
the
olive
oil
carmelizes
bring
out
the
natural
sweetness
of
the
cauliflower
this
version
have
no
sweetness
only

so
i
try
this
restaurant
for
the
first
time
last
thursday
so
let
start
with
the
basic
i
like
the
decor
and
our
server
be
bianca
she
be
real
nice
and
have
great
service
in
spite
of
be
real
busy
or
short
staffed
the
hostess
though
have
the
fuck
off
face
maybe
she
be
have
a
bad
day
now
about
the
food
i
tire
the
bacon
jam
that
shit
be
bomb
only
one
problem
they
barely
give
any
bread
with
it
my
table
have
to
ask
like
extra
serving
of
bread
the
deviled
egg
be
good
but
i
think
they
can
add
a
dollar
more
and
give
one
more
egg
the
pierogi
taste
very
bland
thank
goodness
for
the
cheese
wiz
with
it
my
main
issue
be
their
risotto
the
rice
be
so
undercooked
the
rice
be
hard
i
want
to
send
it
back
but
i
am
see
the
movie
waiting
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
bothersome
since
my
friend
and
i
be
have
a
good
time
but
really
they
get
to
work
on
the
timing
of
cook
the
risotto
so
my
suggestion
be
do
not
order
it
unless
you
want
the
risotto
come
out
the
way
it
come
in
hard
that
what
she
say
lol

salty

strong

great

so
helpful

new
spot

it

bit
a
humor

nice

it
out

into
this

with
pretty
high

i

pretty

just
motivate

this

sheer
disappointment

miss
the
dinner
rush

this

be
still
pack
and
the
vibe
and
ambiance
be
still
upbeat
we
sit
at
the
counter
and
get
a
good
view
of
the
kitchen
our
server
courtney
be
very
nice
and
pleasant
order
the
magarian
for
a
drink
aviation
gin
thyme
lemon
honey
and
cucumber
soda
water
it
be
pretty
standard
nothing
special

beet
salad
the
cauliflower
veal
meatball
steak
slider
taco
and
the
fudge
brownie
for
dessert
i
think
i
like
this
dish
just
because
i
love
beet
in
general
come
with
orange
slice
goat
cheese
and
pistachio
eat
everything
together
and
it
good
if
you
are
not
a
beet
eater
you
might
think
this
dish
be
awesome
but
if
you
are
like
me
this
dish
be
just
your
standard
beet
salad
veal
meatball
nicely
executed
but
i
find
the
flavor
lacking
meatball
be
light
and
not
dense
prepared
and
cook
nicely
it
be
actually
enjoyable
to
eat
except
it
need
more
flavor
it
be
under
season
the
sherry
foie
gras
cream
be
nice
though
you
ca
not
really
taste
the
foie
it
be
a
rich
sauce
but
not
reminiscent
of
foie
at
all
so
that
under
deliver
and
the
pea
i
do
not
know
what
it
do
on
that
dish
it
could
have
be
a
pea
shoot
salad
with
a
nice
zippy
dress
to
cut
through
that
cream
the
steak
we
ask
for
medium
rare
and
it
be
cook
medium
rare
nice
crust
on
the
steak
pink
inside
and
a
nice
sauce
to
accompany
it
with
but
for
a
restaurant
with
a
reputation
like
this
i
already
expect
that
you
know
how
to
cook
steak
although
maybe
they
could
have
use
some
finishing
salt
here
fleur
de
sel
himalayan
black
any
salt
sprinkle
on
top
by
the
kitchen
to
let
me
know
there
some
thought
in
this
dish
do
not
just
send
me
a
piece
of
meat
send
me
a
piece
of
meat
with
some
oomph
oh
and
please
do
not
tell
me
about
the
salt
shaker
for
buck
i
think
it
should
have
come
with
a
side
of
something
potato
or
cream
spinach
or
asparagus
spear
just
something
anything
to
eat
with
the
steak
do
not
have
to
be
big
or
a
lot
meat
need
something
even
michelin

restaurant
give
you
something
mind
be
not
blow
here
the
lamb
gyro
they
be
good
but
you
can
live
with
skip
it
find
real
lamb
gyro
somewhere
else
i
just
have
to
say
that
the
meat
taste
like
spaghetti
meat
sauce
without
the
sauce
short
rib
slider
we
order
these
under
the
recommendation
of
our
server
she
say
these
be
to
die
for
i
think
otherwise
i
do
not
read
the
description
on
this
because
i
trust
our
server
so
i
take
a
bite
know
full
well
what
short
rib
should
taste
like
meaty
rich
deep
earthy
short
rib
except
they
be
not
i
love
short
rib
so
i
be
very
very
very
disappointed
there
be
something
sweet
in
it
then
i
read
the
description
it
say
rootbeer
glaze
it
might
a
well
say
sugar
syrup
because
you
ca
not
taste
the
rootbeer
you
just
taste
sweet
there
be
no
taste
or
note
of
caramelization
to
merit
it
to
be
even
call
a
glaze
that
be
a
sad
excuse
to
call
it
a
glaze
it
be
not
deep
or
rich
i
pick
apart
my
slider
so
i
could
taste
just
the
meat
and
it
be
just
blah
it
be
shockingly
dull
and
under
season
the
slider
bun
come
from
a
bag
they
be
not
warm
or
anything
eat
it
felt
like
a
chore
also
serve
with
tater
tot
which
probably
be
the
highlight
of
the
dish
maybe
the
night
now
the
dessert
bourbon
fudge
brownie
and
brown
butter
bacon
ice
cream
the
ice
cream
be
good
enjoyable
actually
but
that
brownie
my
god
that
brownie
that
brownie
be
serve
to
freeze
hard
a
a
brick
it
be
so
hard
that
when
we
try
to
slice
it
the
brownie
flip
out
of
the
plate
and
onto
the
floor
do
not
need
utensil
at
all
cuz
we
be
eat
what
leave
of
the
brownie
with
our
hand
pick
it
up
and
bite
off
bit
of
it
like
solid
chocolate
it
be
terrible
we
also
order
the
cauliflower
because
our
server
recommend
it
but
the
kitchen
might
have
forget
to
make
it
dessert
come
and
our
check
come
but
our
cauliflower
never
make
it
to
our
table
it
be
still
include
in
our
tab
though
so
i
just
ask
the
server
to
take
it
off

let
the
kitchen
know
what
happen
and
courtney
come
back

apologized

take
it
off

might
there
be

would
not

be
that
they
have
plenty

i
think
offer
just
the
right
mix
of
good
cheer
without
be
cloy
the
only
little
hiccup
be
a
lengthy
wait
for
our
last
dish
maybe
ten
or
so
minute
but
we
do
not
feel
neglected
and
be
not
in
a
rush
so
no
harm
do
in
general
the
atmosphere
be
festive
and
invite
great
energy
our
dish
be
spudssprouts
hash
veal
meatball
wellington
empanadas
and
chicken
thigh
with
chimichurri
the
first
dish
be
far
and
away
the
least
successful
of
the
group
and
be
actually
quite
disappointing
in
flavor
texture
and
even
color
everything
be
monochromatic
the
spud
be
not
fully
cook
the
dish
be
heavy
brown
and
muddle
the
meatball
come
next
and
be
a
revelation
they
be
tender
and
moist
with
a
rich
dark
outer
crust
and
the
foiesherry
cream
sauce
be
divine
especially
the
bright
note
of
sherry
which
cut
through
and
elevate
the
otherwise
heavy
combination
not
sure
how
necessary
the
stray
pea
be
though
third
come
the
empanadas
with
a
gorgeous
butteryflakey
crust
and
moist
and
tender
filling
the
accompany
gravy
seem
to
be
make
from
a
demiglace
a
it
be
layer
with
all
kind
of
delightful
color
problem
be
it
be
facescrunchingly
salty
rarely
be
oversalting
an
issue
in
restaurant
but
this
be
putdownyour
fork
salty
finally
come
the
chicken
thigh
which
i
be
overjoy
to
see
on
the
menu
thigh
be
the
best
and
most
tragically
ignored
part
of
the
bird
and
ck
know
this
and
get
it
right
boneless
and
slightly
flatten
they
be
the
perfect
combination
of
moist
and
juicy
meat
with
cracklingly
crunchy
skin
just
like
god
intend
the
chimichurri
be
a
brilliant
accompaniment
full
of
brightness
and
acidity
but
once
again
it
be
oversalted
the
sauce
man
need
to
take
it
down
a
few
notch
the
chimi
be
not
a
excessive
a
the
gravy
but
it
be
still
distract
nevertheless
i
love
the
thigh
the
juicycrispy
combo
remind
me
of
my
favorite
dish
at
raku
juicy
deep
fry
chicken
so
bravo
and
thanks
ck
i
live
down
the
street
and
be
thrill
to
have
ck
in
the
neighborhood
i
will
be
back
soon
to
further
explore
the
menu

[
a
i
read
over
all
the
glow
star
review
of
this
place
i
have
to
wonder
where
all
the
love
come
from
the
atmosphere
be
great
the
service
be
great
but
the
food
be
just
ok
the
food
be
not
bad
but
i
be
hop
for
much
better
i
have
the
chicken
skin
which
be
deliciously
unhealthy
the
skin
be
crispy
and
delicious
but
i
do
not
care
for
the
smoked
honey
dip
sauce
no
idea
how
you
smoke
honey
but
the
smokiness
leave
a
weird
aftertaste
that
last
far
too
long
i
also
have
the
tempura
green
bean
which
come
out
pretty
crispy
consider
how
much
water
green
bean
have
in
them
pair
with
a
pepper
cream
cheese
the
bean
be
probably
the
best
dish
of
the
night
the
black
rice
oxtail
risotto
be
not
to
my
like
a
little
too
oily
and
definitely
too
salty
even
though
i
have
a
wicked
sweet
tooth
i
actually
find
the
sweet
potato
pie
with
pecan
and
a
stoutlaced
marshmallow
brown
top
too
sweet
i
like
what
they
be
try
to
do
here
an
interesting
spin
on
every
dish
but
the
execution
be
off
just
enough
that
i
ca
not
rave
about
the
place
that
say
i
will
probably
come
back
here
i
love
the
atmosphere
the
staff
be
super
nice
and
friendly
one
of
the
chef
start
chat
with
me
while
he
be
work
and
the
food
be
lightyear
better
than
most
offering
downtown
damn
with
faint
praise
i
know
plus
i
think
the
price
be
pretty
reasonable
so
i
ca
not
say
i
am
die
to
come
back
here
but
i
will
probably
have
another
meal
or
two
at
carson

when

confrontational

beyond
rude

explain
the
whole

would
be
able
to

not

the
mac

realize
it
be
such
a
small
and
intimate
restaurant
we
be
escort
on
their
outside
lawn
which
be
fill
with
lawn
chair

some

ask
the

if
there

wonder

we
could
sit
outside
and
eat

someone
from
carson
kitchen
come
out
and
tell
that
he
could
split
our
party
up
and
accommodate
our
large
party

long
a

finish
by
a
certain
time
due
to
a

we
all
agree

he
say
that
they
could
not

the
could
only
split
in
group
of

ask
why
and

my
friend
be
curious
and
ask
again
why
be
this
the
policy
since
they
could
obviously
split
check
but
it
could
only
be

reply
again
in
a

think
we
all
would
have
agree
even
with
this
interesting
policy

we
be
just
wonder
why
we
be
here

a
conference

we
need
our
receipt

be
itemize

separate

do
not
need
someone
from
the

prospective
customer

am
sure
the

be
great

end
up

i
post
this
review
with
mix
emotion
i
love
eat
here
ever
since
i
find
it
on
a
weekend
getaway
we
have
come
back
many
time
with
famfriends
i
also
refer
others
blogging
ig
fb
love
bacon
jam
with
that
say
i
feel
a
little
gouged
let
me
explain
i
think
it
would
be
a
perfect
place
to
host
a
bachelor
party
dinner
patio
so
i
go
ahead
to
set
up
for
a
dinner
at
pm
but
a
know
it
hard
to
wrangle
up
guy
from
drinking
napping
and
gamble
so
i
call
to
say
i
be
run
late
they
say
that
be
fine
so
we
have
a
good
dinner
then
we
get
the
catering
bill
and
then
i
notice
an
additional
charge
of
i
be
like
shock
the
manager
say
your
party
be
charge
for
every
min
past
the
reservation
which
be
note
in
the
catering
contract
totally
my
fault
for
not
get
the
group
there
on
time
and
for
not
read
the
detail
of
the
contract
but
then
i
review
the
bill
and
i
notice
the
bill
have
a
time
stamp
of
pm
our
reservation
be
to
be
from
pm
so
i
be
puzzle
when
i
be
charge
increment
come
monday
when
i
have
a
chance
to
recover
from
vega
get
too
old
for
this
stuff
look
back
on
the
event
i
be
leave
to
wonder
if
those
additional
min
be
totally
attribute
to
and
only
i
recall
several
possible
factor
that
could
have
contribute
to
those
extra
min
here
be
some
that
stick
out
in
my
mind
even
thou
the
waiter
be
nice
he
do
go
on
some
long
story
about
his
life
in
la
vega
fine
nice
guy
but
let
get
the
food
out
waiter
decides
to
hold
some
food
from
the
table
until
we
finish
other
appetizer
which
we
have
plenty
of
room
for
the
food
for
the
table
plus
with
that
many
guy
we
would
go
through
everything
quickly
no
need
to
wait
but
to
go
back
and
forth
from
the
stair
take
time
the
waiter
be
nice
of
enough
to
bring
extra
dessert
for
to
consume
even
thou
we
be
already
do
with
dessert
added
time
to
our
event
when
fix
the
bill
he
ring
up
the
alcohol
on
the
catering
bill
we
have
say
to
leave
it
on
a
separate
check
so
the
waiter
have
to
go
back
and
adjust
the
bill
then
i
get
the
bill
at
so
what
i
be
try
to
say
be
those
extra
min
could
have
be
cause
by
many
factor
that
we
be
not
in
our
controlfault
i
call
the
carson
kitchen
later
that
week
again
everyone
be
courteous
and
professional
the
gm
hear
me
out
and
i
explain
to
him
the
situation
like
i
state
above
he
say
he
would
take
this
back
to
the
owner
cory
h
because
he
would
ultimately
have
the
final
word
i
mention
again
that
i
am
not
look
for
a
full
refund
just
a
partial
refund
or
maybe
even
a
credit
for
next
time
but
from
the
some
of
the
conversation
with
the
manager
at
the
restaurant
and
over
the
phone
it
seem
that
the
reason
they
be
charge
me
be
because
they
have
be
burn
before
it
seem
to
me
carson
kitchen
want
to
punish
for
be
late
and
for
stay
over
our
time
so
which
be
it
then
be
you
charge
for
be
late
or
have
the
party
go
past
the
time
or
both
because
the
contract
make
it
seem
i
should
have
only
be
charge
for
each
minute
past
my
time
and
not
for
show
up
late
which
you
guy
make
it
seem
for
both
it
almost
seem
that
it
be
out
of
anger
or
resentment
for
past
situation
with
other
customer
and
i
be
tell
any
chance
of
a
refund
would
mean
that
they
would
be
take
a
loss
which
i
totally
understand
why
i
be
charge
for
the
st
min
would
i
have
be
charge
at
pm
if
i
come
at
pm
and
far
a
a
lost
i
mean
it
not
like
i
consume
worth
of
food
and
then
i
ask
for
a
refund
for
that
this
be
min
we
be
talk
about
that
could
have
be
cause
by
carson
kitchen
staff
or
in
the
end
would
not
have
bankrupt
carson
kitchen
or
myself
or
create
anarchy
among
other
patron
i
think
the
compromise
or
gesture
from
carson
kitchen
would
have
be
nice
it
would
have
garner
so
much
more
effort
from
me
to
post
on

about
the
situation
in
a
more
positive

i
be
now

leave
a
bad
taste

have
a
good
evening

a
really
great

bake
brie

to
try
it
the
sweet

salty
bacon
jam
with
brie

good

not
my
thing
also
there
be
not
nearly
enough
baguette
for
the
amount
of
spread

be
so
rich

you
do
not
need
very
much

ask
for
more

an
extra

certain
the
fish
roe
on

not
from

rather
black
tobiko

roe
the
deceitful
description

very
disappointing

these

this

a
beautiful

they
need
more

perhaps
better
option
for

they
need
to
make
the
option

sound

they
would

have
preview
the

there
be
more

could
eat
like
the
flatbread
also
a
good
traditional
tempura
batter

there
really

be
pleasantly
pleased
that
the
location
be
right
next
to
the
donut
bar
so
i
could
try
out
both

we

lucky
to
land
a
parking
spot
right
in

of
the
these

parking

sparse
in
this

if
you
be
not
pay
attention
you
can
drive
right
by
we
walk
in
and
be
promptly
seat
at
the
bar
i
also
notice
that
there
be
bar
that
you
can
sit
at
and
watch
the
chef
make
your
food
for

not
busy

the

pretty
small

also

level

perhaps
more
people
be
seat
upstairs
our
bartender
chris
be
really
helpful
and
basically
explain
that
their
menu
change
with
each
season
the
current
menu
be
for
spring
he
tell
that
it
be
better
to
choose
a
couple
of
different
item
on
the
menu

the
idea
be
to
share
the
food
we
view
the
menu
and
start
with
chicken
skin
bacon
jam

shrimp
dunderi

anxiously
await
the
arrival
of
our
food

let
me
say
i
make
i
huge
mistake
in
order
the
chicken
skin
i
think
i
read
chicken
wing
they
be
accompany
with
a
honey
sauce
which
be
tasty
but
the
whole
skin
thing
yikes
i
be
not
into
thank
goodness
the
bacon
jam
make
up
for
it
this
dish
have
carmelized
bacon
with
melted
brie

most
yelpers
have
rave
about
it

spread
this
delicious
combination
on
the
small
baguette
they
provide
and
experience
melt
in
your
mouth

next
come
the
shrimp
dunderi
which
come
with
only
with
two
prawn
and
a
ricotta
style
pasta
this
be
flavor
with
limoncello

be
delicious

think
they
could
have
spar
at
least
six
prawn

the
dish
run
this
bring
my
review
down
to
three
star

we

at

there

look

would
like
to
go
back

it

they
have
just
take
the
time

nothing
more
frustrating
to
see
your
food
prepare

ready
to
be
serve

no
one
be
around

you

it

anyone

actually
busy

the

a
good

the

for
me

even
so
this

can
be
avoid
with
a
simple
seat
number
system
when
the

take
the

just
some
constructive
criticism

hope
they
rethink
this
side
of
the
service

some
runner

paint
it
powder

do
not

anything

that
fine
i
be
already
anticipate

our

would
have
to
sit
outside
anyway

of
the
kid
she
seat
the

ahead

outside
on

ok

i
typically
get
at

they

the

be
too
thick
the
chicken

the
rice
be
hard

nothing

you
ca
not
really
mess

up

a

we

walk
pass
multiple
time
without
a

in

after
bring
it

take

him

up

still

will

nacho

oversaturated

spicy

the
impression

any

an
accident
it

primarily
a

be
amazing

quaint

i
really
want

that

why
i
am
write
this

the
second

i
go
there
i
go
around
pm
and
ask
to
sit
on
the
back
patio
that
be
a
mistake
because
the
sun
be
blaze
hot
and
there
be
no
umbrella
fan
or
mister
it
not
even
summer
yet
and
the
outside
will
miserably
fail
if
something
be
not
do
to
change
that
so
everyone
be
move
table
and
switch
spot
to
avoid
the
sun
which
bring
me
to
another
problem
that
park
probably
wo
not
be
able
to
fix
a
easily
the

all
the
trash
from

so
horrible

throw

do
not
know
how
they
are
go
to

ca
not
expect
to
serve
food
to
people
when
they
are

trash
revolt
then
we
order

mac

cheese
philly

bar
chicken

it
take
minute
for
the
food

come
out
at

for
anyone
to
realize
there
be
an

sausage
this

overflow

them

end
up
be
too
rich
it
be
hard

not

another

hot
it

they

out

of

we

not

somehow
they
take
most

the
flavor
out
of
this
inherently
tasty
mix
of
ingredient
the
garden

the
most
bland
veggie

have
ever

and
that

something

at

look

good

you
can
see
some
black
bean

piece
of
colorful
veggie

it

they
use
zucchini
maybe
or
some
other
fillerblack
hole
of
flavor
for
the
rest
of
the
patty

the
flavor

stretch
too
thin

top
it
with
tomato
cucumber

i
love
in
the
right
context

in
this
case
it
also
just
add
to
the
blandness

arugula

normally
tasty
just
get
swallow
up

the
blander

super
light

topping

really
good

some
day

better

long
for

that
taste

not
the

what

only
the
henderson

post
their

this
be
especially
disappointing

i
would
already
plan
out
what
i
want
but
lo
and
behold
it
be
not

the
menu
of
the
downtown
location
be
much
more
abbreviated
i
end
up
order
the
bbq
nacho
which
be
good
but
the
sauce
be
very
strong
and
there
be
a
lot
of
cilantro
we
also
have
chip
salsa
the
chip
be
great
and
the
salsa
very
hot

also
have
a
raspberry
margarita
which
be
super
sweet
i
like
sweet
drink
but
this
be
even
too
sweet
for
my
taste
we
also
get
an
order
of
the
smores
nachos
to
share
and
sing
happy
birthday
to
me

be
okay
just
beware
that
the
marshmallow
sauce
be
really
sticky
just
pass
it
around

girl
get
some
of
it
stick
in
her
hair

i

it

hard

get
off

very
friendly

casual

i
think
they

a
little
strapped
for

look
like

come
with
onion
on
it

tell
our

the
pickled
onion

it

very
close

a

you
will
frequently
get
whiff

an
unpleasant

reason
for
only
two
star

the

cocktail

the

be
abysmal
i
never

i
still
would
have
give
it
three
star

the
last

i
be
there
the

be
so
bad
that
it
bring
me
to
yelp
we
have
a
large
group

the
first
thing
that
happen
when
we
be
seat
be
our

spill
an
entire
glass
of
ice
water
down
the

our

instead

apologize
he
throw
a

at
her

run
away
he
never
return

clean
up
my

go
to
the
bathroom
to
dry
off

i
go
to
speak
with
the

i
just
do
not
like
the
way
it
be
handle
no
apology
not
clean
up
the
spill
just

her
a

the

even
tell
me
the

run
away
and
be
hide
over
it
this
should
not
have

this
big
of
a

i
spoke
with
the

everything

fine

come
over

our

she
also
have
a
conversation
with
my

separately
where
she
state
this
however
when
the
bill
come
she
decide
what
be
fair
would
be
to
only
comp
my
friend
meal
because
she
be
the
only
one
that
have
water

on
her
she
then
claim
she
never

she
would
comp
a
round
of
drink
for
the

of
hear
her
say
it
additionally
despite
the
immediate
error
the
service
do
not
improve
we
never
saw
our
waiter
after
he
bring
our
food
again
none
of
this
would
have
be
this
big
of
a
deal
have
he
just
apologize
and
help
clean
up
if
the
manager
have
not
state
she
would
comp
drink
for
and
then
change
her
mind
and
if
we
have
just
get
some
acknowledgment
during
our
meal
i
hate
be
a
pain
in

the
way

make
me
upset

tell
that
if

would
come

the

with
longstraighttwo

be
nowhere

with

go
up

ask

hostess
apologize
that
her
coworker
have
forget
about

then
walk
into
the
back
garden
where
there
be
several
open
seat
why
we
be
not
give
a
seat
in
the
garden
initially
be
a
mystery
to
me
the
garden
be
exactly
what
i
imagine
it
to
be
i
would
not
recommend
take
older
folk
here
since
the
music
be
loud
and
some
of
the
chair
be
slightly
uncomfortable
i
wish
they
have
more
apps
on
the
menu
it
would
be
nice
to
order
a
few
side
rather
than
a
large
meal
they
have
fry
etc
but
nothing
healthy
i
end
up
order
the
veggie
slider
which
be
delicious
the
bun
be
stale

the
veggie
patty
itself
be
delicious
my
guest
have
the
corn
flake
crust
chicken

he
love
it
throughout
the
meal
our
waitress
be
miss
a

our
drink
be
empty
most
of
the
time

i
even
notice
the
table
next
to
make
loud
slurp
noise
from
their
glass
probably
hop
to
get
the
attention
of
a
waiter
the
outside
bar
have
a
group
of
employee
hang
around
talk
most
of
the
time
so
the
issue
be
not
understaffing
i
hope
management
read
these
review
because
i
really
want
to
like
this

it
be
just
a
bad
night
i
will
be
back
soon

try
it
again

sloppy

coors

mickey
malt
liquor

young
double

you
could
try

little
bit
of
everything

a
shot

always
seem

a
fun
concept

you

that

thing

so
enthralled

sweet
potato
teeter

be
really
funky

in
a
good
way
the
sweet
mustard
dip
sauce
they
include
with
em
really
add
that
extra
yum
factor
but
a
few
of
the
dish
i
have
try
be
just
sorta
ok
the
first
time
i
visit
i
try
to
order
the
grill
cheese
on
brioche

sound
to
die
for
it
be
ed
which
be
fine
because
it
be
their
grand
opening
week
and
they
have
just
have
their
soft
open
right
before
so
they
have
run
out
of
a
bunch
of
thing
not
a
big
deal
i
will
get
it
next
time
instead
i
try
the
philly
mac
and
cheese
steak
which
be
pretty
tasty
but
the
second
time
i
visit
i
be
sad
to
see
that
they
have
take
that
grill
cheese
off
entirely
sad
sad
day
so
i
choose
the
veggie
wrap
which
come
in
a
tortillatype

case
it
be
just
eh
kinda
greasy

sometimes
be
good
but
not
in
this
case
not
enough
melt
cheese
and
not
enough
feta
crumbles
plus
the
veggie
be
kinda
wet

it
be
a
little
hitandmiss

here

am
confident
it
will
more
likely
than
not
get
better
over
time
maybe
i
am
just
be
picky

perhaps
i
have
order
the
wrong
thing
only
time

more
visit
will
tell

have
a
number
of
great
dining
experoences
but
recently
the
service
here
have
be
for
the
most
part
mediocre
if
not
outright
nonexistent
in
most
case
it
be
simply
that
the
server
have
unenthusiastic
attitude
no
smile
and
an
apparent
overall
distaste
for
have
to
be
at
work
that
day
a
number
of
the
time
the
service
be
slow
and
it
be
hard
to
get
the
server
attention
without
them
seem
annoy
i
understand
that
this
be
a
pretty
high
traffic
place
in
the
evening
and
none
of
this
be
normally
bad
enough
to
mention
i
mention
it
now

of
the
problem
i
have
with
the
hostess

tell
her
we
have
minor
in

ask
if
we
could
sit
on
the

abruptly
and
demeaningly
inform
my
party
that
minor
be
not

you

get
a

it
they
really
have
scratch
our

when
they
give
the
discounted
price

then
serve
a
mini
version

you

pay

also
get

it
insane
not
a

do
a

instead
of
serve

those
stupid
minisized

better
off
pay
full

get

no
decent
flavor

it
be
not
bad

it
be
not
season

presumably
anything
special
there
be
surprisingly
some
pink
to
the
meat
which
be
a
rare
sight
for
a
stuffed
burger
give
how
much
longer
they
usually
have
to
be
cook
although
give
the
unknown
quality
of
the
meat
i
am
not
sure
if
this
be
a
good
thing
the
bacon
inside
be
soggy
and
take
away
from
any
cheese
or
onion
flavor
which
be
not
anything
too
great
either
the
lettuce
tomato
and
onion
on
top
be
fresh
and
ok
but
overall
there
be
nothing
special
about
this
burger
which
be
surprisingly
dry
despite
be
stuff
with
so
much
the
fry
be
nothing
special
either
of
the
larger
cut
variety

soggy

barely
at
room

the
report
i
have
hear
be
true
everything
here
look
way
better

it
actually

be
surely
unfortunate

really
want
everything
that
open

particular

it

absolute
amaze
job
and
it
one
of
our
favorite
place
therefore
we
think
go
downtown
it
would
be
even
better
we
be
wrong
let
me
preface
this
review
by
advise
management
not
need
contact
me
to
make
the
situation
better
a
address
my
concern
should
be
do
at
the
restaurant
unfortunately
we
have
ryan
a
a
server
who
tend
more
to
the
smaller
brunette
hostess
then
his
table
along
with
our
table
we
be
unattended
for
so
long
when
it
be
not
even
busy
that
we
go
to
the
bar
to
get
a
drink
since
we
already
have
a
table
the
bartender
with
the
dread
assume
that
i
would
not
tip
her
because
i
be
not
sit
at
the
bar
so
i
be
give
an
attitude
about
order
a
drink
from
her
lucky
for
her
i
am
a
decent
human
be
and
i
understand
that
this
be
a
service
industry
and
tip
need
to
be
give
a
i
be
a
bartender
for
four
year
after
convince
the
bartender
she
can
give
me
a
separate
check
for
the
drink
i
go
back
to
the
table
and
watch
ryan
from
afar
at
the
hostess
stand
in
the
end
i
see
there
be
a
lack
of
management
at
the
restaurant
a
if
a
manager
be
on
the
floor
they
would
notice
the
lack
of
activity
from
their
server
training
also
need
to
be
establish
you
should
call
the
henderson
property
and
see
how
they
handle
their
staff
then
maybe
you
would
not
get
a
review
like
this
]
[
the
food
and
service
have
be
pretty
good
on
my
first
visit
here
i
be
sorely
disappointed
last
night
if
you
want
abuse
and
poor
service
this
be
your
place
after
we
be
seat
by
the
hostess
for
about
minute
another
person
come
and
politely
tell
that
the
table
have
be
reserve
for
a
large
party
and
that
we
could
sit
outside
or
squeeze
in
at
the
bar
i
order
mac
ball
and
fish
taco
at
the
bar
a
server
come
out
fast
with
two
plate
include
garbage
fry
i
let
him
know
that
it
must
have
be
someone
else
order
that
when
the
fight
start
the
bartender
tell
me
you
order
mac
and
cheese
ball
and
garbage
fry
when
i
let
him
know
what
i
truly
ordered
he
reply
with
no
you
say
he
be
visibly
agitate
i
stop
talk
after
some
hemming
and
haw
the
bartender
say
something
like
i
guess
i
can
put
in
a
new
order
for
fish
taco
i
ask
him
not
to
bother
i
pay
for
the
mac
and
cheese
and
left
for
good
the
customer
be
not
always
right
but
this
bartender
win
the
argument
and
lose
the
customer
this
restaurant
must
have
all
the
business
that
they
need
to
fire
customer
like
this
happy
holiday
]
[
street
park
an
hour
this
place
be
decent
if
you
are
in
the
area
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
personally
the
item
on
the
menu
do
not
draw
my
attention
then
i
saw
the
chalk
board
with
deep
fry
oreo
with
vanilla
ice
cream
which
i
order
it
come
with
oreo
and
spoon
size
ice
cream
scoop
not
sure
why
they
do
not
just
give
the
traditional
scoop
the
oreo
be
great
and
there
not
many
place
you
can
get
that
around
vega
so
plus
for
that
but
the
ice
cream
be
barely
enough
to
eat
with
every
cookie
my
party
enjoy
the
garbage
tot
and
breakfast
wrap
but
not
the
chicken
and
waffle
the
fried
chicken
look
good
but
it
be
dry
you
could
get
a
better
piece
of
chicken
at
raise
cane
or
chick
fil
a
their
mimosa
be
delicious
though
for
a
bottle
of
champagne

oj
btw
service
can
be
lack
we
have
our
cash
with
the
bill
ready
but
no
one
seem
inclined
to
pick
it
up
]
[
very
average
minus
place
location
be
quite
prime
but
the
food
be
far
from
decent
just
high
price
for
below
standard

server
jenn
be
a
sweetheart

the
kitchen
need
serious
improvement
on
logistics

update
of
what
available

what
not
nice

if
it

you
are
look
for
check
out
other
spot
nearby
quite
a
lot
of
them
]
[
probabaly
the
worst
service
i
have
have
in
awhile
our
server
who
do
not
even
tell
her
name
take
about
minute
to
greet
when
she
bring
out
our
mimosa
she
forget
the
cup
so
we
have
to
wait
again
just
for
that
so
an
hour
into
sit
down
we
still
have
not
receive
our
food
and
other
table
that
be
sit
after
be
already
eat
and
finish
up
our
server
do
not
even
come
over
to
check
on
so
we
have
to
ask
another
person
who
be
the
manager
and
finally
our
server
come
over
to
tell
something
happen
but
it
should
not
be
much
longer
so
it
right
now
and
mind
you
we
get
there
at
noon
and
we
just
get
our
food
it
be
cold
what
a
surprise
it
taste
like
it
be
sit
under
a
light
because
our
server
forget
about
it
so
we
ask
to
talk
to
the
manager
and
with
very
little
obvious
interest
she
ask
what
wrong
and
we
inform
her
of
our
situation
and
to
which
she
reply
she
busy
wow
thank
you
so
much
it
honestly
seem
like
she
do
not
want
to
talk
to
because
we
be
the
only
minority
there
which
if
that
be
the
case
shame
on
them
so
we
have
be
wait
an
hour
and
that
all
you
can
say
no
sorry
no
i
understand
your
frustration
just
she
busy
and
if
she
be
that
busy
then
why
do
not
another
server
help
her
out
not
very
nice
of
her
coworkers
honestly
the
worst
server
and
manager
do
not
care
at
all
and
to
top
if
off
the
food
be
mediocre

i
could
give
this
place
a
zero

would

popular

of
the
aesthetic

hang

taxidermy

hipster
paradise

remind
me

almost
every
restaurant
i
visit
in
austin
unfortunately
food

service
be
just
soso
the
waitress
give
me
an
attitude

i
ask
to
sit
outside

when
i
ask
if
there
be
an
option

look
at
the
lunch
menu

the
brunch

discover

there
be
a
beautiful
courtyard
with
a
ton
of

would
have
be
really
nice

be
give
that
option

consider
it
be
fairly
empty

just
open

rubbery

not
crispy

loaded
tot

so
much
queso

the
tot

just
turn
into
one
big
mush

rubbery

sure

we
make
bad
pick

just
mehh
food

we
be
not

best
part
of
the
meal
be
the
dollar
bottle
of
champagne
that
come
in
a
plastic
shopping
bag
so
hipster

that
basically
like

mimosa
for
dollar

be
a
steal

i
am
ever
back
in
the
area

would
probably
opt
to
eat
elsewhere

for
a
drink
on
the
back
patio

in
the
back

taco

decent

be
not
a
big
deal

either
way

they
are
not

do
however
have
an
issue
with
the
baby
do

use
to
give

mean
it
be
like
a
gulp

a
half

peruse
the
page

be
not
able
to
see
any
mention
of
taco
tuesday

try
the
chicken
and
waffle
sandwich
recently
and
maybe
it
just
me
but
it
be
not
a
good

i
remember
i
ca
not
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
be
different
maybe
it
be
the
waffle
or
the
chicken
but
sad
face
from
me
lie
i
say
the
drink
be
mostly
good
but
there
be
a
few
i
be
not
a
big
fan
of
but
thats
completely
suggestive
people
complain
about
the
service
i
am
not
really
go
to

it
be
good

bad

theres
be
time

there
be
a
wait
to
get
drink
and
stuff

it
be
not

not
do

good

love
the

by

the
best

i

not

me

beginning

server
andrea
come
over

we
order
a
patio
pounder

an
entire
bottle
of
champagne

a
craft
of
oj
for
my

order
a
coffee

a
very
short

move

leave
our

in
direct
sunlight

both
of
start
to
get
very
hot

our

come
over
to
again
to
drop
off
our
drink
we
explain
our
discomfort

ask
to
be
move
to
a
shady
table
that
have
just
open
up
she
say
yes

course

happily
move
to
the
more
comfortable
table

take
our
food
order

five
minute
later
the

come
up

plainly

you
ca
not
stay
here

to
sit
at
a
table

we
could
comfortably
enjoy
our
brunch

do
not

it
be
an
outrageous
request

embarrassingly
move
back
to
our
original
sunny
table

receive

she
come
to
our

only
twice
once
right
after
we

due
to
the
two
bite

once
more

disappointing
evening
we

first
we
order
some
drink
at
the
bar
and
they
be
out
of
quite
a
bit
of
the
beer
no
biggie
so
we
switch
our
order
sierra

a
can
bottle
of
orange
blossom
and
a
heineken
tall
can
really
be
this
a
club
look
around
nope
so
only
one
beer
for
for
the
evening
no
fun
tonight

we
get
seat
and
order
our
food
philly
mac
cheese
sandwich

the
fried
chicken

waffle
sandwich

the
philly

that
be
about
it
meat
be
bland

cheese
have
no
cheese
taste
like
bread
crumb
the
bread
be
too
hard
and
dry
would
not
order
again

the
waffle
sandwich
very
small
not
worth
the
price
then
the
chicken
be
like
rubber
so
we
send
it
back
and
do
not
request
a
replacement
on
a
side
not
the
tater
tot
be
good
but
not
enough
then
time
for
the
check
they
have
the
audacity
to
try
and
charge
for
waffle
sandwich
when
we
send
it
back

i
ask
for
all
at

i
can
decide

they

you
a

smaller

a

ok

for
some
reason

here

on
yelp
review
for
brunch
with
my
boyfriend
on
a
saturday
late
morning
we
be
purposefully
look
for
spot
that
be
not
on
the
strip
so
we
choose
this
non
touristy
place
in
the
downtown
area
venue
service
slightly
on
the
dark
side
when
we
come
in
with
grey
wood
and
wrought
iron
decor
luckily
we
have
a
bit
of
sunlight
by
sit
near
the
window
vibe
of
a
down
to
earth
homey
brunch
spot

thank
goodness
it
be
a
much
quieter
affair
than
you
would
find
on
the
la
vega
strip
server
be
in
general
very
friendly
always
check
on
the
water
and
try
to
reassure
that
our
food
be
come
out
food
i
prefer
lighter
affair
so
perhaps
i
am
bias
against
most
brunch
spot
even
so
i
felt
like
everything
here
tend
to
be
a
bit
on
the
heavier
side

perhaps
we
order
the
wrong
item
egg
benedict
spinach
tomato
bacon
chive
potato
well
balanced
dish
this
be
the
favorite
between
the
two
dish
egg
be
perfectly
cook
and
yolky
what
save
this
dish
be
the
acidity
from
the
grill
tomato
and
the
kick
you
get
from
the
hollandaise
sauce
i
usually
hate
thing
that
have
heat
to
it
but
you
need
the
spiciness
a
bit
to
lighten
up
the
dish
especially
since
there
be
a
huge
dollop
of
the
sauce
over
the
egg
would
have
prefer
le
of
that
potato
be

do
not
need

chive

bacon
on

with
chive

by
the
waiter

unfortunately
we
be
disappoint
mushroom
and
chive
be
great
in
term
of
add
earthy
flavor
but
the
egg
be
slightly
overcook
and
overall
the
dish
felt
really
heavy
there
be
too
little
feta
to
help
with
that

also
a
lot
of
bread

both
keep

it

some
sort
of
acidity
more
herb
in
it

brighten
up
the
dish

date
struggle

finish
it

heavy

stomach

probably
not
the
best
brunch

however
if
you
be
look
for
a
nice
quieter
spot
in

can
be
a
spot
to
consider
just
perhaps

not

for
that
sandwich

put
our

there

some

that
nobody

i
go
here
for

disappointed

main
issue
be
service
we
come
in
for
brunch

wait
for
roughly
minute
before
our
waiter
come
over
to
take
our
drink
order
during
this
time
other
wait
staff
glance
in
our
direction
but
do
not
take
the
initiative
to
assist
when
the
waiter
finally
come
i
felt
like
we
be
inconvenience
him
he
do
not
really
speak
to
it
be
more
like
a
drive
through
drink
eat
that
it
in
regard
to
food
it
be
okay
i
have
chilaquiles
be
from
new
mexico
and
be
disappoint
that
the
red
chile
be
overpower
the
green

sausage
be
also
fairly
bland

the
ambiance

hip

casual

the

look
like
typical
hipster
vegan
with
their
multicolored
hair
and
septum
piercings
i
quite
like
their
living
plant

some
spaghetti

pineapple
it
be
serve
in
a
cute
mason

be
appropriate

it

just
like
a
scented
candle
sadly
they
be
all
out
of
the
save

we
have
to
settle
for

the

the
kind
you
use
to

like
everything

the
ginormous
hunk
of
salt
which
accord
to
our
waitress

the

suppose
to

sincerely
hope
nobody
lose
a

of
these
the

be
nice
enough
to
take
it
off
our
bill

alright
because
i
do
not
have
mushroom
in
my
tummy
for
dessert
anyways
i
should
also
mention
that
they
want
to
wait
minute
and
we
have
to
ask
if
they
would
lettuce
sit
on
the
terrace
they
do
not
carrot
all
that
we
have
no
utensil

napkins
the
entire
time
we
be
there
overall
i
am
glad
to
have
bean
there

olive
myself
and
my
wallet
too
much
to
go
back

[
first
off
the
food
be
fabulous
then
reason
why
i
give
this
place
star
be
because
of
the
servicestaff
every
point
of
contact
from
the
hostess
to
our
server
and
the
food
runner
be
rude
short
and
have
very
bad
attitude
the
hostess
give
a
hard
time
about
seat
when
our
table
have
already
be
set
up
with
high
chair
and
everything
but
want
to
wait
till
the
rest
of
the
party
show
up
which
understandable
but
you
already
set
up
the
table
it
seem
a
though
the
service
staff
be
so
overwhelmed
with
the
busyness
that
they
be
frustrate
and
be
take
it
out
on
after
we
tell
the
hostess
the
rest
of
our
party
be
park
she
make
a
snide
remark
that
we
need
to
order
before
they
close
and
they
close
in
hour
the
food
runner
have
drop
our
food
at
the
wrong
seat
so
while
we
switch
them
she
sigh
and
roll
her
eye
our
waiter
drop
off
our
check
before
we
be
even
finish
eat
our
entree
without
even
ask
for
it
we
then
want
to
order
more
coffee
and
dessert
after
our
meal
but
do
not
seem
to
have
the
option
to
because
we
felt
rush
and
push
out
it
such
a
shame
because
all
the
food
be
absolutely
amazing

a
super
cute
little
restaurant
downtown

pay
to

it
easy
to
miss
if
you
have
never
be
there
before
their
breakfast
be
pretty
delicious
they
have
the
biggest
slice
of
bread
that
i
have
ever
see
and
their
pancake
be
ridiculously
good
i
also
fantasize
about
their
cinnamon
biscuit
with
strawberry
compote
the
few
thing
that
i
do
not
like
be
that
we
have
never
have
a
friendly
waiterwaitress

some
reason
the
time
i
have
be
there
the
waitstaff
always
act
like
they
be
do
a
favor
by
help

they
try
to
suggestively
sell
you
side
of
everything

bigger
size
of
whatever
you
order

understand
the
concept

it
get
pretty
annoy

you

try
to
place
an
order
on
a

extra
thing

to
every
person
i
also
have
to
warn
you
that
their
veggie
burger
be
terrible

the
next
time
i
go
i
order
another
dish
without
the
bacon

the
waitress
say
we
be
too
busy
right
now
to
make
any
substitution
uhmm
i
be
not
make
a
substitution
i
just
say
no
bacon
anyway
eat
be
actually
worth
a
try
because
everything
be
make
from
scratch

high
quality
i
just

this

a

at
the

the
potential

literally
two
minute
away

of
a
block
they

allergy
inside

they
have
to
seat
in

at
this
point
i
am
livid

it
a

truffled
egg
sandwich
i
want

order
be
not
actually
on

menu
instead
i
have
beignet

be
just
ok
they
be
moist

doughy
not
the
light
fluffy
texture

associate
with
beignet

be
a
box
of
cafe
du
monde
beignet
mix
sit
on
a
shelf
in
the
kitchen

i
guess
maybe
they
use
that

the
texture
be
unlike
the
real
thing

not
even
like

one

make

same

be
serve
with
a
really
tasty
jam

greatly
improve
the
flavor

also
find
the
coffee
to
be
a
bit
weak

be
normally
not
something
i
would
not
even
bother

mention

it
important

the
way
to
go
here

be
pleasant

a
bit
scattered

do
get

right
away

basically
peak

shot

it

nothing
special

would
have
like

have
order
something
different

there
be
not
too
much
on
the
menu
to
choose
from
so
i
opt
for
the
simple
expect
that
at

the
size
of
the
meal
would
compensate
for
the
lack
of

factor

know
about
keep
the
choice
on
the
menu
simple

this

plain

okay
nothing
really
special

get
to
the

there
be
soggy
crust
that
absorb
all
of
the
sauce
from
the

make
the
filling
thicker
than
pot
pie
normally
be
the
top
be
crunchy
enough

it
would
have
be
better
if
they
just
do
the

on

just
put

have
the
mushroom
pizza

be
decent

would
have
be
much
better
if
they
use
something
other
than
daiya

daiya
in
my
opinion

many
others
be
the
bottom

if
they
make
more
homemade

am
from
nj

have
try
many
vegan

by
chloe
in

this

just
do
not
come
close

have
have
at

come

vegas

amazing
vegan

probably
wo
not

do
hope
that
the

read
my
review

take
it
constructively

make
some
change
homemade
food
be
key
if
they
use
gardein

outsource
meatball

of
the
easiest
and
most
delicious

tone

when
i
order
pasta
i
usually
only
order
vegetable
in
it
i
can
skip
the
meat
however
i
ca
not
skip
out
on
flavor
and
in
my
opinion
they
do
mexican
hummus
do
not
take
like
hummus
rather
just
plain
black
bean
at
least
there
be
a
half
of
a
jalapeo
in
there
i
cut
up
and
add
to
each
chip
tamale
bland
bland
bland
i
have
to
ask
for
salt
and
then
add
it
to
the
hummus
too
i
like
the
masa
the
pumpkin
and
chile
but
it
be
just
so
boring
and
bland
the
waitress
say
she
like
to
ask
for
extra
chile
do
not
that
tell
you
something
ravioli
ok
this
one
be
ok
but
too
sweet
i
guess
it
be
the
sweet
potato
but
it
almost
seem
if
they
add
sweetener
like
honey
or
something
i
like
my
pasta
savory
not
sweet
overall
i
apologize
to
all
the
vegan
that
love
this
place
but
in
my
defense
even
my
longtime
strict
vegan
friend
tell
me
it
be
very
bland
and
disappointing
to
her
too
i
mainly
give
it
a
instead
of
a
because
the
staff
be
so
polite
and
nice
and
even
comped
my
tamale
however
it
be
just
not
enough
for
a
good
dinning
experience
im
sorry
but
i
wo
not
be
back

i
am
give

i
felt

not

be
the

there
be
not
a
lot
of
creativity

nothing
that
blow
me
away
my
corned
beef
hash
be
fine
but
nothing
special

friend
ms
w
and
mr
p
both
get
the
pancake
it
be
a
much
better
portion
for
the
price
compare
to
my
dish
and
the
pancake
be
very
nicely

i
particularly
appreciate
the
little
jar
of
real
maple
syrup
they
come
with
but
get
plain
and
simple
pancake
just
be
not
my
thing
i
need
them
full
of
granola
smother
in
nutella
and
top
with
strawberry
because
i
am
that
kind
of
crazy
girl
the
best
most
special
thing
i
have
be
definitely
the
devil
egg
they
be
pankoencrusted
and
fry
then
top
with
bacon
now
we
are
talk
maybe
i
should
have
try
their
cinnamon
biscuit
top
with
strawberry
it
seem
to
be
one
of
their
most
popular
dish
and
base
on
the
pancake
and
the
amazing
bread

i
hear
great
thing
about
this

really
want
to
like
it

it
disappoint
me
both
in
food
and
service

not
bother
me
a
it
seem
to
bother
other
reviewer
you
have
to
pay
for
park
which
be
inconvenient
if
you
do
not
have
change

i
be
willing
to
do
that
if
the
food
be
good
sadly
it
be
not
first
of
all
our
server
be
very
aggressive
he
put
his
hand
on
the
back
of
my
chair

lean
in
close
to
my
personal
space

creep
me
out
i
appreciate
friendliness
but
i
do
not
appreciate
you
get
really
close
to
me
my
husband
notice
it
right
away
too
we
have
coffee
while
wait
for
our
order
it
be
not
horrible
or
anything
i
have
have
much
worse

it
taste
over
extract
like
they
be
skimp
on
the
amount
of
coffee
use
to
brew
it
at
a
cup
yep
in
total
for
two
mug
of
coffee
it
should
taste
better
than
that
my
husband
order
shrimp
grit
and
he
love
it
he
order
it
because
that
the
dish
he
hear
others
rave
about
i
order
the
egg
benedict
and
holy
moly
the
sauce
be
sour
not
a
good
kind
of
sour
either
the
bacon
be
also
limp
and
chewy
yes
it
be
turkey
bacon

i
eat
at
home
all
the

it
do
not
even
taste
like
it
be
cook
it
be
really
gross
the
serve
size
be
small

that
would
not
have
bother
me

the
food
actually
taste
good
i
do
not
like
stuff
myself
with
huge
portion
at
breakfast

it
hard

rip
off

you
pay
for
english
muffin

limp
bacon

sour
hollandaise
sauce
the
ambience
be
cool

hipsterish
i
think
it
cool
that
they
let
their
waiter
have
tattoo
and
dye
hair
but
that
do
not
make
the
food
taste
better

the

creepy

loud

verdict
waste

money

they
will
work
the
kink
out

the

the
tamale
the
steamed
bun
have
some
flavor

be
mostly
disappointing
steam
bun
be
just
about
my
favorite
food
so
this
be
sort
of
heart
breaking
i
want
to
love
them
but
the
bun
itself
be
not
steam
long
enough
and
be
still
sticky
dough
on
the
inside
i
think
it
be
because
they
be
so
much
thicker
than
the
usual
bun
also
the
tofu
mushroom
and
spinach
do
not
give
any
textual
difference
no
crunch
i
think
tempeh
would
have
be
a
more
exciting
protein
on
the
bun
also
i
need
more
sauce
then
i
have
the
tamale
it
could
have
be
great

it
be
far
to
thick

big
cylinder
the
masa
be
a
bit
dry
out
in

the
filling

be
delicious

the

would
have
benefit
from
a
sauce

some
kid
to
accompany
it

out

upsetting
version

gooey

puke

highly
consider

one
bother

up

the

quality

cleanliness
uniqueness

if
i
can

it
at

find
similar
food
somewhere
else

consider
all

anything

you
order

i
am
so
disappointed

have
be
wait
to
come
here
with
my
sister
since
she
vegan
we
finally
make
it
and
to
be
honest
i
could
have
skip
this
place
i
am
not
vegan
but
i
have
be
to
many
vegan
vegetarian
restaurant
i
appreciate
the
art
it
take
to
creat
vegan
option
since
there
a
lot
of
ingredient
to
substitute
in
the
everyday
meal
most
of
eat
the
ambience
be
beautiful
i
love
the
plant
and
art
on
the
wall
the
rustic
modern
design
be
nice
there
be
a
live
dj
which
really
put
the
beginning
experience
over
the
top
we
walk
in
and
be
quickly
seat
our
waitress
ask
what
we
want
to
drink
we
give
her
our
order
and
off
she
go
to
be
honest
it
take
a
good
minute
just
to
get
drink
which
be
a
iced
chai
and
an
iced
coffee
the
long
wait
do
not
really
bother
since
we
be
catch
up
but
after
awhile
it
become
ridiculous
there
be
party
that
come
in
after
that
get
their
food
before
we
could
order
i
keep
have
to
catch
our
waitress
attention
just
to
get
her
to
help
i
am
not
sure
if
she
forget
about
because
we
be
somewhat
in
the
corner
but
the
place
be
not
busy
to
not
see
it
be
about
minute
of
sit
there
until
we
get
to
place
our
order

it
take
about
another
half
an
hour
for
to
get
our
food

order
the
free
the
tuna
appetizer

meatball
sandwich

my
sister
get
the
vegenation
sandwich
with
the
time
it
take
to
get
our
food
i
expect
a
lot
more
my
bread
be
soggy
and
the
food
be
not
even
warm
it
be
colder
then
what
i
would
expect
and
the
fry
where
so
burnt
and
hard
i
could
not
it
break
it
in
half
with
my
hand
my
sister
burger
be
so
mushy
that
she
have
to
eat
it
with
a
fork
and
her
fry
be
not
better
then
mine
so
sad
i
ask
for
our
check
and
my
free
sunday
with
the
yelp
check
in
i
request
it
to
go
because
to
be
honest
i
do
not
want
to
have
to
wait
an
hour
for
it
by
the
time
we
get
our
check
and
be
able
to
pay
for
our
meal
we
have
to
rush
back
to
our
meatier

the
two
hour
that
we
add
have
already
expire
before
we
could
go
on
our
marry
way
to
the
container
park
so
with
this
devastate
experience
i
wo
not
recommend
my
fellow
vegan
and
vegetarian
friend
nor
will
i
be
back
there
better
restaurant
with
food

not

the

an
odd
name

be
a
tortilla

red

green
chili

banana

be
not
a
good
combination

all
i
almost
get
sick
after
the
first
bite
next
i
opt
with
something
simple
which
be
the
chicken
sausage
and
pancake
it
come
with
one
small
link
of
sausage

large
golden
pancake
the
pancake
be
average
and
drowning

very
cake

consistency

decent

there

would
think
this

a
healthier

take
one
bite

it
taste
like
popcorn

be
weirded
out

i
keep
try
to
figure
out
why
it
taste
like
popcorn

i
realize
how
much
butter
they
put
on
the
bread
it
like
they
smother
it
with
layer
of
butter
while
toast
it
all
i
taste
be
butter

this

definitely
not

be
cover
in

butter

get
one
pickle
spear

even
the
pickle
be
not
good

personally
believe
they
should
change
the
brand
they
buy
again

all
base
off
of
personal
taste

am
sure
other
people
love
it
why
else
would
everyone
rate
it

get
one
side

i
get
the
tomato
soup

again

out

this

maybe
they
should
use
a
smaller

put
it

that
the

do
not

no

when

be
fair

do
not
exactly
order

most
exciting
thing
on
the

get
egg
two
scramble
egg

will
point
out

i
give
prop

a

many
good

about

go

breakfast

our
last
trip

ago

keep
it
simple
egg
bacon
toast
potato

mean
we
get
our

plus

be
fresh

hot

obviously
reheat
from
the
day
before

be
soggy
with
oil

do
not
mind
the
reuse

the
poor
preparation
kill
what
would
otherwise
have
be
a
tasty

friendly

professional

in

keep
up

a
attentive

she
could
have
be
under
the
circumstance

we

satisfy
with
the
quality
of
the
service

i
am
back
in
the
downtown

my
next
trip

might
give
eat
another
try

will
probably
go
for
a
lunch
item
instead

a
little
overpriced
overhyped

generally
good

somewhat
limited
bfast
menu

no
egg
benedict

the
beignet

something

my
own
concoction

tabasco

delicious

chive

butter
strawberry
compote

really
dissatisfy

the

sit
everyone
in
the

suggest
that
they
might
want
to
seat
people
by

the

look
busier

her
rule

i

sure
she
be

she
should
have
just
say
thanks
for
the
suggestion

smile
they
have
make
a
few
mistake
here
and
there
but
they
seem
wellintentioned
and
i
am
hop
they
will
get
everything
straighten
out
for
example
the
health
department
shut
them
down
after
inspection
but
they
fix
everything
very
quickly
and
they
fix
it
all
perfectly
so
that
the
next
inspection
the
next
day
find
zero
violation

review
them
again

them
higher
mark

the
worst

over

out

light
flaky

rather
dense

doughy

off

superb
i
know

be
get
into
something
tasty
and
delicious
a
i
could
smell
the
aroma
of
my
chived
potato
wait
to
be
devour
i
do
not
need
to
add
any
hot
sauce

which
be
available
upon
request
there
be
perfect
amount
of

mushroom
in
between
slice
of
the
warm
cibatta

my
buddy
both
get
the
pancake

so
typical
of
newlywed

have
a

chicken
sausage
atop
it
with
a
strawberry
and
power
sugar
to

am
not

of
a
pancake
girl
maybe
with
my
makeup
time
to
time
when
i
am
rush
so
my
review
on
them
will
be
bias
it
be
okay
they
be
very
popular
here
so
feel
free
to
order
them
both
of
them
like
their
pancake
note
we
really
want
to
order
the
beignet
to
share
however
the
waiter
say
that
they
be
discontinue
i
know
i
hear
discontinue
which
be
a
real
bummer
a
they
seem
very
very
popular
so
i
am
hop
the
waiter
be
just
misinform
or
mean
to
say
that
they
be
not
be
serve
the
morning
we
go
that
be
a
real
bummer
hence
the
knock
of
a
star
for
the
rating
all
in
all
i
am
pretty
positive
that
i
will
be
back
again
and
i
am
already
think
i
will
be
back
with
the
other
yelpxtian
bestie
a
she
jelly
that
i
eat
here
await
that
ce
check
first
it
really
a
star

if
we
have
decimal
to
rate
with

i
recommend
ityes
would
i
come
backprobably
would
i
reorder
what
i
eat
drankdefinitely
the
sandwich
however
i
would
opt
out
of
get
tea
again
a
i
ca
not
justify
the
pricing
for
it
maybe
i
will
just
get
another
drink
there
be
other
option
on
the
menu
that
i
would
like
to
try
and
maybe
i
could
give
an
updated
review

happy

on
this

your
choice

on
the
golden
brown
pancake

wait
for
our
food

waiter
put
down
a
side
plate

packet
of
butter
and
miniature
container
of
syrup
my
friend

i
decide
to
ask
the
owner
about
her
choice
of
serve
pre
package
butter
and
syrup
she
tell
it
be
more
sanitary
they
could
tell
how
much
syrup
each
customer
use
and
be
more
cost
effective
her
answer
be
satisfactory
until
i
really
think
about
it

my
side
of
english
muffin
come
out
the
butter
packet
be
on
top
of
the
english
muffin

it

barely
toast

soggy

think
to
myself
how
many
time
those
butter
packet
have
be
handle

how
unsanitary
it

the
two

the
breakfast

fine
however
the
chicken
apple
sausage

very
greasy
my
friend

tasty

also
greasy

be
ginormous

[
we
usually
eat
breakfast
at
egg
i
but
decide
to
try
this
placewhat
lure
in

the
pic
of
the
beignet
which
we
find
out
be
actually
no
longer
on
the
menu
wtf
talk
about
false
advertising
then
what
breakfast
place
worth
it
weight
in
gold
do
not
serve
freshly
squeeze
orange
juiceespecially
after
a
long
night
of
dancing
and
drinking
this
be
essential
small
yet
quait
with
indooroutside
seating
and
decent
decor
and
ambiance
but
who
really
care
about
that
at
breakfast
good
food
freshly
squeeze
juice
option
and
great
service
be
how
we
judge
our
breakfast
spot
whats
save
this
joint
be
the
food
fresh
ingredient

righteous
spicing
be
key
so
if
you
are
ok
with
decent
service
no
freshly
squeeze
oj

good
food
without
the

definitely
give
this

try
at

once

filteted

not
it

a
nice
menu

conceptit

great
to
see

a
whole
potato
yes
whole
potato
cut
and
serve
with
my

have
grizellda
i
am
sure
do
not
spell
it
right
she
be
nice
but
i
felt
like
nothing
above
and
beyondjust
to
greet
it
take
her
at
least
minute
yes
i
time
her
she
be
attend
one
other
table
really
the
least
you
can
do
be
introduce
yourself
and
say
you
will
be
right
with
i
understand
the
industry
i
be
in
food
service
retail
and
now
beauty
i
get
people
she
be
more
concerned
talk
amongst
the
other
employee
than
to
take
the
time
also
if
you
pass
the
table
i
am
sit
at
and
you
stare
at
me
maybe
you
should
smile
i
am
refer
the
the
rest
of
the
staff
it
do
not
hurt
i
mean
i
am
smile
it
be
not
hard
to
reciprocate
so
overall
i
will
go
back
and
just
get
the
togo
or
maybe
try
a
different
shift

the
food

pretty
good

the
service

poor
we
arrive
about
pm
on
a
sunday
they
have
a
ton

apparently
they

for
the
day

to
go
up
to
the
counter

refill

beignet

an
appetizer

i

the

forget
to
put
the
order
in
because
it
take
almost
minute
overall
disappointed

very
interesting

baconcentric

the

the

omelet
the
the
homemade
jam

vanilla
marscapone
that
come
with
the
beignet

excellent
the
outer
bite

inner
fluffiness

just
right

the
flavor
a
little
off
the
egg
be
cook
really
nice
and
creamy
the
potato
nicely
caramelize
and
the
bacon
crispy
she
like
a
lot

think
it
be
weird
that
everything
have
the
same
seasoning

sit
at
the
bar

we
could
get
a

them
cook

be
on
lowstaff

madness

brainer

at
a
loss
of
what
to
eat
this
visit

be
very
hungry
so
the
server
suggest
that
i
try
two
type
of
pizza
on
each
half
so
i
do
that
and
ask
her
to
choose
what
ever
else
she
think
would
be
good
she
choose
the
picante
pineapple
a
the
second
half
of
the
pizza
it
consist
of
charred
pineapple
jalapeno
and
sausage
crumbles
it
all
vegan
so
it
obviously
not
real
sausage
and
be
remenicent
of
chorizo
in
flavor

chorizolike
sausage
crumbles

not
too
hot

palate

it

be
use

pizza

little

medium

awful

the

much
higher

the

nice

once
you

i

it
still
one
of

for
a

i
could
give
it
another
halfstar
i
probably
would

there
be
a
few
thing
that
i
have
to
consider
pro
awesome
coffee
in
the
morning
nice
atmosphere
and
decor
great
homemade
chip
delicious
grilledcheese
sandwich

a
freaking
amaze
tofu

mi
seriously
that
be
one
of
my
favorite
thing
there
con
the
spicy
posole
be
disappointingly
bland
to
my
palette
perhaps
an
offday
the
breakfast
dish
with
the
tortilla
chip
name
of
which
be
escape
me
and
apparently
the
website
be
down
so
i
ca
not
check
be
tasty
but
ultimately
muddle
in
flavor
probably
the
most
frustrating
thing
and
the
one
that
still
stick
in
my
craw
be
the
day
i
grab
a
salad
to
go
i
get
the
spinach
salad
with
aspragus
and
almond
and
decide
to
add
some
shrimp
i
saw
that
the
shrimp
addon
be
kind
of
spendy
and
ultimately
the
salad
cost
me
when
i
get
to
the
office
i
be
disappoint
to
find
a
tiny
salad
and
three
tiny
shrimp
that
more
than
shrimp
so
yeah
ultimately
i
like
the
food
i
have
my
favorite
but
i
ca
not
round
up
to
star

may
change

me

on
our

be
not
that
hungry

be
super
bum
we
waste
the
good
leftover
this
past
experience
be
way
different
we
show
up
and
the
hostess
inform
she
have
a
min
wait
just
to
be
put
on
a
wait
list
who
do
that
why
ca
not
you
just
put
everyone
on
a
wait
list
and
give
a
realistic
wait
time
i
felt
like
she
do
not
want
our
business
she
do
however
inform
that
we
can
do
take
out
so
we
decide
to
take
that
route
we
go
to
the
take
out
counter
and
again
the
guy
say
it
would
take
min
for
take
out
in
a
tone
that
kinda
make
me
feel
like
they
do
not
want
our
business

tell
him
it
fine
and
we
put
in
our
order

go
to
the
bar
next
door

be
actually
really
cute

i
love
the
atmosphere
we
get
back
to
our
hotel
room

the
food
be
pip
hot

be
nice
the
spring
roll
be
really
yummy
the
chicken
pad
thai
order
at
a
level
be
too
spicy
for
my
and
besides
the
spice
it
do
not
have
much
flavor
the
noodle
look
whiteish
and
i
remember
it
be
more
red
last
time
so
that
be
a
super
disappointment
the
short
rib
fry
rice
be
actually
really
good

they
use
real
short
rib
meat
it
be
super
yummy

husband
like
the
pad
thai

i
like
the
rice
the
food
be
good

probably
not
the
best
thai
i
have
ever
eat
the
reason
for
the
three
star
be
the
management
need
to
get
their
staff
on
a
better
program
for
wait
time

maybe
teach
them
a
thing
or
two
about
customer
service

forget
to
mention
we
ask
if
we
could
make
a
reservation
for
a
later
day

she
say
they
only
do
that
for
large
party
it
just
ridiculous
to
be
so
vague
about
when
you
can
actually
sit

fee
someone
we
may
come
back

arrive
the
level
of
excess
in
this
one

beyond
what
i
have
see
and
that

a

obviously
this

fairly
confident

two
down

be
helpful
to
make
a

hour

disappointing

finally
sit
down
our
waiter
be
nice

the
food
be
tasty

the

water
down

would

in
the
future
i
would
not
go
back
for
dinner
due
to
the

check
it
out

the
taste

clever

more
disappointed

overpower
the
totality

ice
tea
here

it
need
more
of
the
thai
iced
tea

the
balance

a
bit
off

have
a
bunch
of
normal
thai
dish
like
the
papaya
salad

yellow
curry

get
the
awesome
flat

okay

not
too
different
from
most

it
up

what

do
want

ask
for
a
level

spicy
level

be
not
always
common

best
thing

delicious

with

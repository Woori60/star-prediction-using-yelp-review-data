{"stars": 2.0, "text": "My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't.  I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone."}

Their Fried Wontons put everyone else to shame, though. Crab Rangoon also delicious, sometimes a little overdone but as far as affordable chinese food goes, I gladly drive the hike up Green Valley to their location by the 215 just for them even though Amlee is across the street (btw, Amlee- NEVER AGAIN).

I very much appreciate Metro's decor, which harkens back to the original diners. enjoyed the chicken-fried steak and the hash. I wouldn't get the pot pie again, as they use rolled-out biscuit dough as crust. The best crust (and a flaky one) for pot pies is James Beard's recipe, which uses egg yolks as an enrichment. There will be plenty left over to take home. The waitpersons are trippy and very helpful. One day I asked for mashed potatoes....and they didn't have any...is that unforgivable for a diner? Stuck with fries again. I will definitely be trying their stuffing waffles sometime soon. We'll be getting a Metro Diner on Serene at Eastern (near WalMart and Home Depot), which will attract a lot of people down off the hill."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Sit down or on the fly China Tango quickly became my go-to Chinese restaurant in the Green Valley area.   Absolutely love their chow mein and sweet & sour chicken. Pro tip regarding sweet & sour chicken....most places give you the sauce on the side and refuse to mix it in the wok. I hate that. China Tango is more than happy to mix it in the wok so you're not left dipping when you get home.   They give you so much food it's ridiculous. A 2 item combo is enough for two people plus left overs. Most Chinese restaurants (other than Panda) have a lunch menu then cut off all the combos for dinner time. Not China Tango. Their meal-deal is available all the time. Entree, side item (fried/white rice or chow mein), cup of soup, egg roll and crab rangoon.   Another cool thing, when you order to go they give you your food in a box if it's a large order. Keeps it from sloshing all over the place on the drive home and is a really nice touch to keep things steady. Appreciate the extra effort that they give.   Far and away my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I was in the neighborhood at lunch time, and had heard good things from a couple of friends, so I thought I would give Metro Diner a try. The ambience is typical old-school Diner Ambience with lots of booths and specials written on a Blackboard on the far wall. The menu is pretty much breakfast and lunch Comfort Foods with nothing really exciting. Breakfast has lots of waffles pancakes and omelettes. Lunch menu has hamburgers and salads. I went with a western omelette. The Omelette was large and filled with typical western omelette goodies. It had a very tasty salsa on the side. I got a side of cut up fruit for a $0.50 up charge. Overall it was a filling tasty meal with pleasant service. If I lived in the neighborhood I probably would go back. But there's certainly nothing special about this Diner that would make me want to travel to it."}

In short, there doesn't seem to be anything to distinguish this diner from any other in Vegas and it's no better (possibly worse) than a Denny's. Would try again for breakfast...maybe."}

Although the portions are large, the quality is not good. The chicken has a weird texture. It's dry inside and mushy on the outside.   *The styrofoam container for the chicken melted and changed shape. They should invest in better quality containers that don't LEAK.   *If you do decide to order from here, be sure to get enough napkins/ soy sauce/ forks because i received exactly ONE of each. For two people. This was my mistake, because i should have made sure I had enough. It doesn't matter too much as i actually threw all of the food away. Not worth the money.

She was offered fruit or tomatoes at no extra charge.   Service was good, maybe a little inexperienced but very nice.

We decided to just get a side order of their chicken since we wanted to get other breakfast items. My friend and I decided to just get 1 drumstick each.  - They charged us $7 for the 2 small drumsticks. - Holy crap, it was near inedible as it was a complete salt bomb.  - My friend commented that they've been really inconsistent with their fried chicken lately.  1st time: It was delicious, the best fried chicken I've ever had.  2nd time he had it, he said it was super bland, so bland that he had to add salt to it himself.  3rd time/yesterday: We damn near got high blood pressure. All you could taste was the salt.  BREAKFAST CROISSANT ($7):  You can't go wrong with eggs, bacon and cheese. Very generous with the eggs and cheese, it was basically spilling over. What I didn't like was getting only 2 dinky slices of bacon.   CRAB CAKE BENEDICT ($14): Best dish of the day. The two crab cakes were meaty and tasted delicious, the hash brown was crispy and lightly seasoned.   It took over 25 mins for us to get our food. The kitchen just couldn't keep up, you could see the servers all standing around by the window waiting to pick up their food.

Customer service was good but only thing that bothered us was it seemed like our server was faking being nice too much. Nothing wrong with that but being genuine would be a lot better. Will definitely go eat here again though!!! Glad this opened up next to our house"}

They're always really fast at getting your order ready. The parking can be tricky during busy hours such as lunch and dinner since it's surrounded by other frequently visited businesses. The food isn't anything to write home about but not bad either. The menu is pretty generic. Again, I recommend this place for a quick Chinese meal if you're not into Panda Express."}

Going to checkout we asked if they do a military discount and the waitress said I think we do let me check. Minutes went by and we were still waiting. We just ended up walking up to the front to get our check and she said I'm sorry she still hasn't done it but it's only like 10%. I said at least it's something and she continues to say that her manager is always up there bothering them to do stuff she can't believe that she isn't up there. After saying that she gave us the bill and said so it's going to be x amount. I was amazed.   I work costumer service and am a manager at my job. Never do we speak badly about our managers especially to our customers.   Also, the food wasn't all that good either. Nothing to rave about and the lack of urgency just killed it all.   I was hoping this would be my new go to restaurant but I probably won't go back."}

Trop. location 3 stars as well, but I actually liked that set-up and service there better.    This location was very busy when we stopped by for dinner, so we sat at the counter to avoid the 45-60 minute wait.  Their counter seating is small and a little odd.  It's right next to the expediter, so we got a firsthand look at why they were so backed up.  He seemed truly lost and didn't want to listen to any of his servers who seemed to know more than he did.  I didn't like how rude he was to them.  The kitchen staff was very nice though.  They actually asked us a couple times what we had ordered because they could see how long we were waiting (over 35 minutes) for our food.  I ordered the Chicken Salad on a salad ($10.49).  It was filling, nothing special, but no complaints on flavor.  Everything was premade, so it should have taken less than 5 minutes to come out.  John got the Meatloaf Plate ($12.99 + $3.99) He asked if he could sub a garden salad for the potatoes and baguette.  The waitress said sure, but didn't mention that it would cost more.  It would have been nice to be told in advance that this was a $4 up charge.  Not a lot of money, but it's kind of crappy to add a charge without notice, especially since a garden salad is only 50 cents more than a side of mashed potatoes.    Our waitress was nowhere to be found for the majority of our visit.  I asked the hostess if we had one after about 10 minutes.  A server came over and took our order, but that's the last time we saw her.  We never got iced tea refills and the kitchen staff just handed us our plates over the counter (which we appreciated).  I had to ask the expediter for a copy of our bill so we could pay and leave.  Maybe we'll try again  in a couple months since the location is perfect for us."}

Our Grandson, Chase (an active Marine based in Camp Pendleton) and his girlfriend Denae had been at the Festival the night previous.  We had picked them up during the melee along with others on Tropicana Ave.  It had been a horrible night for all of us and we had stopped for a quick breakfast before going to the Lexus Hotel to recover belongings and for them to return home. We had previously dined here and loved it.  However, after dining on a super wonderful meal we asked our Server Patience for the check.  The onsite manager, Hanna, informed us their was not charge and they would take care of the check.  They thanked myself (a veteran) and my Grandson for our service and explained how sad they were for the events they had observed at the Festival.  What a wonderful gesture and pleasant surprise from a very concerned group of employees and employers.  I have in the past experienced wonderful service and food.  These people are incredibly gracious, attentive and professional.  It felt like family.  Just wish to thank them for their kindness and tell them they have a customer for life.  We plan to visit them often. They are exactly what a people business should be and they demonstrate great pride in our city and community.  We would recommend them to anyone interested in great food and service in Henderson.  Thank you all for being so wonderful, concerned and thankful. You are the best.

And the key is that it was genuine friendliness and enthusiasm; they weren't just going through the motions.  I had the avocado veggie wrap which includes fried jalapenos, carrots, spinach, avocado, sour cream, red onions, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ranch dressing.  It came with your choice of side; I had it with french fries that were cooked to my liking, not too crispy and not undercooked either.  The wrap was excellent! The diet coke I had was really good as well.  Sometimes fountain beverages don't have the proper fizz or don't taste right for some other reason, but this was one of the best diet coke's I've had!    The only negative is for me is that I'm a vegetarian and they don't really have any lunch or dinner choices for the vegetarian other than the aforementioned wrap and a grilled cheese sandwich.  I suppose you could also get a spinach salad and either hold or substitute the bacon for something else.  Another option is to get the macaroni and cheese along with some other side dishes such as cole slaw, sauteed veggies, and fresh fruit.  But otherwise I really loved it and look forward to coming back!"}

Upon receiving my drink order I was given egg drop soup and fried wonton strips. I wish I could have been given a choice because I didn't touch either one and am still feeling guilt for wasting food! He took my order and before I could blink my food was at my table!   So, A+ and bravo for the really great service and large and generous food portions.. But the taste was a no go for me. I am far from a picky eater, but I ended up just eating the fried rice from my meal. I got Kung Pao chicken, and it just wasn't right. The sauce just tasted like a... molten salt lick. No sweetness, a hint of tangy, a ton of salt. And when placing my order, the server warned me it would be spicy, maybe the salt killed the spice? And the texture of the chicken wasn't appealing for my mouth either. One of the reviewers commented on how they deep fry everything which can answer to the texture of the chicken.  I'm glad this is well liked by the community, and I understand why due to the speediness, heaping portions, and small cost, but next time I'll stick with what I know I like."}

There was ample parking in front and in the back of the building. There was a 20-25 min wait, but it ended up being less than that. There were many people on staff and everyone who helped us from taking our order to clearing plates was friendly and timely. The menu had a lot of options and I already have some ideas for when I come back! The food was delicious! We got the fruity waffle and breakfast burger for 10 and 14 dollars. And I will say, the food wasn't just good, it was a step up from your typical breakfast place. It was very good. Although I could have stood some more bacon on the burger. I also saw a lot of salad options going by and they all looked incredible. Overall very satisfied with the experience.   Part 2: I came back the following weekend because my first experience was so good. I was expecting it to be another great experience, but this time it was out of this world! I'm blown away. We ordered chicken and waffles and the bold city burger. Let me tell you, best burger, ever (added avocado). Greatest chicken and waffles ever (tied with Hash House for best dish) except Metro Diner has STRAWBERRY BUTTER! The waffles at Metro are the lightest most amazing waffles ever and I found a piece of real strawberry in my strawberry butter! I can't even express how delicious this meal was (we half/half both dishes via plate swapping) Even the very last bite of the burger had ALL THE TOPPINGS on it. That never happens.

Our Server seemed very knowledgeable about the items and was able to make a few suggestions. I went with the spicy honey chicken biscuit and cheesy grits. My husband had pancakes and Turkey sausage, he was definitely pleased with the quality of both and even said their coffee was decent. My breakfast sandwich was ok....what made it for me was their buttery biscuit, the best I've ever had... I could do without the chicken however. The strawberry butter tasted artificial I'm not a fan. The cheesy grits were an epic fail, I'm a grits gal, and they totally messed up my grits. Too watery, and had too much black pepper. It was not good. Our waiter then started to drift off and was no longer attentive to our needs, he had the label Trainer on the back of his shirt but seemed to be gossiping with his coworkers instead of actually training smh...you would think if the customer mentions the only reason why they came in was because they seen it on Drive Ins Diners and Dives, it should be clear indication they would be writing a review about their experience after the fact , so wouldn't you want to be on your Ps n Qs?

I ordered the burger that was made with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and the burger in the middle. It was yummy. I have to say I am extremely picky when it comes to meat...this was good. Well seasoned. I like the lettuce slaw...mayo, lettuce and pickles...perfect idea. For me the only thing that could have made it better was if the crusts were cut off the grilled cheese sandwiches. It was a lot to try to wrap my mouth around and I was very disappointed in the mac N cheese. I thought at a diner it would have been amazing but it tasted like noodles with canned cheese on top. My man had the fried chicken plate. He said it was really good. Very tasty chicken and juicy. At the Stephanie location , although it was brand new, a lot of employees with trainers, the feeling and vibe was SO much better. The noise was just the patrons enjoying themselves not a man yelling out orders. Our waitress altough new was very pleasant and did a great job. Her trainer...omg...you guys need to promote him. I wish i remebered his name...he was from Rainbow he said and has only been with the company for 2 months. You would have thought he had been with you for 10 years. My staff all ordered something completely different.  Huevos rancheros with chocolate chip,banana pankcakes and the other was a burger with swiss,bacon and mushrooms. I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye! As I stated i am very picky about meat so I was a little hesitant to try the pastrami and I am SOOOO glad I did. It was the best I have ever had!  I will definitely be returning to the Stephanie location!!! I will let my photos speak for themselves!"}

Every meal has been wonderful.  The Charleston Shrimp & Grits is my favorite.  The roasted red pepper grit cakes are topped a delicious shrimp and sausage sauce.  It's a very generous dish with always leftovers to take home.    The Metro Club is also a nicely done sandwich with the amount of meat and ingredients piled into it.  It's lightly toasted bread tries to hold together the mile high sandwich.  I opted to try the Mac & Cheese with the sandwich.  It's decadent and creamy.  I would absolutely order it again as a good side dish.    Seriously the service here is so friendly.   Our drinks are always filled and multiple staff members check on our dining experience.

Well, he was right because it turned out to be the most delicious waffle breakfast I've had in a long time.

First of all I have found they deliver a lot faster than the 45-60 minutes suggested on the app. We always order about $100 worth of food. There are 3 of us and it lasts a week for leftovers so that's part of the fun. The level of spicy flavor in foods like the pad Thai is fantastic. I love high spice levels and they do a great job. We have tried a huge variety of the menu and it all was delicious. The textures are all excellent and if the food should be crunchy, it's crunchy and if it's supposed to be tender, it is! The amount of food for the price is also excellent and if you order sweet and sour sauce laden items they give you a good sized tub which we like to drizzle over our rice as well. The delivery guy also brings our large order in a cardboard box so nothing spills. We also often get extra fortune cookies. When I moved to Nevada from California we were afraid we would not find a happy Chinese restaurant to order from, but we are highly satisfied. I can hardly wait for the next time we order!"}

Today's featured dish is the Garlic Shrimp, which gets an 8 out of 10.  I've had this a few times and it never disappoints! I love mushrooms, and the funky alien looking shrooms in this dish are cool. And tasty. Lots of veggies in this one too, and it's spicy (don't chomp on the small red peppers) which I love.

The cheese topping was definitely shredded/grated cheese (the same one that's on salads, I believe it was cheddar cheese). Also the food was already cold when I took it back which was disappointing! Overall I felt like I was eating one of those microwavable pasta dinners and was disappointed.  For the price (Paid around $14~, can't remember), I definitely expected better.

Their deserts are made daily and constantly changes and so do the specials, I've never tried the specials but the desserts are super yummy!

We ate in so we were served. I had a lunch special so it was served in a plate lunch box (which I was fine w/ as usually I don't eat all my food in restaurants anyway. It would already be set to pack up & take hm if I didn't finish). Anyhow, I ordered fried rice, chow mein, sweet sour pork (which I'm so picky w/ because it's one of my fav Chinese dishes, & it also came w/ a soup. I believe it was miso soup but don't quote me on that. They also give a tray of what looked like wonton chips appetizers which you dip in sweet sour sauce. A bit too greasy but my little one loved it! =) All this for about $12 or so. I did buy a fountain drink of course. Not too bad for the amount of food we were served. Back to the sweet sour pork, absolutely delish! Not too hard & not too greasy. & most of all... Not super drenched in sweet sour sauce. I hate it when the crispy batter around the meat is soggy before I even get to eat it. This was perfect! Way better than what pandas serve anyway. Chow mein & fried rice was great as well. Tasteful.

Well,  they got the ham, turkey and cheese ok (but not much of it) and the bread was like almost a whole loaf!  It was deep fried but you though you were eating slightly flavored bread.  They provided some sort of a berry dip to spread but overall it couldn't hold a candle to New York Deli (that burned down 10 years ago) or the Pine Tree Restaurant of Spring Mountain that CLOSED two years ago.  Short version... there's no where in Southern Nevada that knows how to make a Monte Cristo.  Part two...my wife had the bar-b-que sandwich which was ok BUT...they provided their version of a bar-b-que sauce that was the color, consistency and FLAVOR of catsup with a little bit of pickle in it.

I ordered chicken chop suey and orange chicken. I thought both were very good. I LOVED the chicken chop suey, and the orange chicken was very good too but I didn't think it was any better than Panda Express but this place delivers and that scores major brownie points, for fast food Chinese. Over all, I will order again. I would say it's good step up from Panda Express.   China Tango is not to be rated against a nice sit down authentic Chinese restaurant.   PS: my order came with two containers of white rice free, I normally order brown rice if offered but I didn't see the option to choose, and honestly I didn't know I'd even be getting rice so no biggie. :)   PSS: This place is FAR FAR FAR better than the Chinese delivery (I won't name names) in the Sprouts/Target center at Green Valley & Horizon Ridge."}

I was super excited to eat here based on the reviews but the best I can give this restaurant is a 3. I ordered the huevos rancheros which came with chorizo and fried jalapenos. I had to salt pepper and add much hot sauce to give this any flavor at all. I'm going to give it at 3 because it wasn't bad it just wasn't good. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and enjoyed her dinner much more than I enjoyed mine. She rated hers a 4."}

I'm not sure if this was the usual playlist, nor am I going to deduct stars, but it was definitely a surprise for my first visit.  In any event, this is a casual Chinese restaurant in the mold of China A Go Go. I ordered the Hong Kong style chow mein, which is my usual order when eating at a new Chinese restaurant. Food came out quickly and piping hot. They didn't skimp on the chicken, beef, or shrimp, which made it a good value.

First visit was during lunch with the coworkers - arrived 20 minutes before noon and was seated right away. I swear as soon as 12pm hit, it became super busy - all tables were filled! The staff were very friendly and had bubbly personalities! I ordered the 'Fried Chicken Plate', includes half a chicken - fried, mashed potatoes with gravy, grilled veggies and a biscuit. Dinner item for lunch, I know weird, but before ordering we kept seeing the chicken pass by and didn't want so much of the breakfast/lunch food, so that was the best bet. Definitely did not disappoint - chicken was super crispy and moist, mashed potatoes were buttery good, the grilled veggies were simple but nothing beats that grilled, charred taste, and those biscuits made from scratch daily, ughh *drool*! Also, had a side of onion rings.   Second visit was during dinner with family, it was SUPER packed! Informed a 15-20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad. Staff was still very friendly though! I decided to try the 'Chicken and Waffles with the Strawberry Butter'. I know I went opposite this time -- breakfast for dinner, lol! Chicken this time around was a bit salty. The waffles were perfectly crisp and that strawberry butter is amazing! Such a unique concoction!  Mom got the steak and eggs. TBH, we've had better - so this was just ok in our books. Stepdad got chicken fingers with fries. Brother got 'Bold City Burger', which has cheese, onions, bacon, sausage, jalapeños, lettuce, tomato on a brioche bun - this was soooo good! ALOT to take in (literally) but the toasted bun with all the ingredients together takes this burger to the next level! A MUST TRY!  Very pleased with both visits and like I've mentioned before, I LOVE comfort type of foods! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}

I was happy to see that this location opened up because it is closer to me than the other two locations in town.  Overall, the food was good with the exception of the fish and chips which were HORRIBLE. Small, thin, sad little pieces of fish with a weird texture. And the tartar sauce was just glorified relish. I couldn't bring myself to finish the dish.  We were seated promptly upon entering, but after that, the service was pretty terrible. One guy noticed we had been waiting awhile and announced that he wasn't actually our server, but would get us drinks. Ruby was our server and only came by our table to take our order and to take the bill. The first guy and bus boy checked on us more than she did. Plus she left me with the IPad after I paid instead of waiting the five seconds to wait for me to just sign and be done with it. Felt weird to be left with such important equipment. I also waited a good portion of time for her to bring the receipt, but it wasn't until I got fed up and started to walk out that she scurried over to our table and handed my mother the receipt.  I will give them 2 stars because the rest of the staff was AMAZING! People got the door for us and even though this first guy wasn't our server, he went out of his way to help us out.  I know this diner is new and they are still probably trying to figure things out, but I feel disappointed considering it has rave reviews from everyone else. I feel jipped."}

I personally didn't find it spicy, but there were a couple of thinly slices pieces of jalapeño so watch out if you're not into spicy.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I've salsa'd, flapped the funky chicken, but never done the China Tango.  This is a typical fast food Chinese place, over salted meals and quick service, but  sometimes you just gotta succumb to the call of MSG. I actually thought this place was pretty good, although not something I would eat everyday.   I sat and was immediately greeted with water and fried wonton shells and a sweetened dipping sauce. These were a nice little touch for a dine-in fast food place, especially since I was starving! I ordered the Crab Rangoon, which is a fried wonton with cream cheese and crab meat inside. These pretty much tasted like fried cream cheese and there was barely any crab meat inside. The little crab meat I did find I'm pretty sure was from a can. Not my favorite.  After I snacked on Crab Rangoon the main course arrived. Ma Po Tofu with Pork and I swapped out the rice for Chow Mein noodles. This dish was huge!  It had mounds of noodles and a full plate of spicy tofu and pork. This was a lot better than I thought it might be especially after the Crab Rangooning that happened moments earlier. The tofu was cooked prefect and melted in my mouth, pork was very flavorful, but I wish it was cut into bigger chunks instead of minced pieces. Still very good and very spicy!   The Chow Mein substitute was a good call. These were a perfect compliment to the spicy tofu/pork plate. They were soft and seasoned perfectly, I could have eaten a plate of these noodles by themselves.  China Tango is great spot for a quick bite, but I wouldn't frequent it unless I wanted to go into a sodium induced coma."}

None of that here. The flavors are spot on. My favorites include the moo goo chicken, singapore noodles, and shrimp with broccoli. Large portions that arent drowning in salty sauces. Yay!"}

In Utah there's a place called the Italian place that is a hundred times better and you can get a huge sandwich for $10 and share it and not have to tip a server. I got the pastrami sandwich that had an egg on it and cheese and coleslaw. I didn't realize that it had Fry's on it too. I'm sorry but it just wasn't very good .  The bread was not toasted at all. It was these big slices of bread with all this stuff on it so it was really hard to eat. The Fry's that were on the sandwich were squished soggy and cold. The egg on the sandwich was cold . It did lot of meat on it though, but it has this really strong flavor like it it's been brining forever. I didn't get any mustard for the pastrami and the waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted any. Who eats pastrami without mustard ? Then my husband realized that he's lost his wallet and we had to leave. The waitress brought us our containers to put our food in and then I went up front because we were in a hurry and I didn't want to have to wait for her to get my credit card. She finally came up there and ran my card then left me standing there with the paperwork that I had signed and I had to wait for someone to come back up there to get it. So I tipped her $1 less then I was going to. I mean if she is going to leave me standing there when she knew I had an emergency then tough luck your not getting much of a tip from me.

(didn't try-looked absolutely delicious).  Diner service from host/hostess, waitress, visiting regional manager, and the amazing COOK was phenomenal.

I ordered take-out shrimp chop suey, which came with chow mein and fried rice. The total was about $7 bucks-ish. Remember, they don't give you condiments unless you ask, so don't forget!   The shrimp chop suey was decent and flavorful. There were plenty of vegetables, which was delicious. The shrimp was bit tough, which was my only complaint for this dish. The chow mein noodles and fried rice were very bland. I wasn't too crazy about it.  When I walked in to grab the food, the service wasn't all that great. Not personable.  Overall, if you're looking for a quick bite that is cheap and fast, then don't hesitate to give this place a shot!"}

I've been meaning to write them a review for some time, so here it is. Whether I've dined in, gotten delivery or carry-out (I've done all three numerous times!) I haven't been disappointed with their food, service, and overall experience. It's been my go-to spot for fast, affordable Chinese food.  What I love:  - No MSG. Enough said. - They offer brown rice. Healthy! - Generous portions. Cause we're hungry people! Or we just love leftovers. - Lunch specials are till 4pm. Who can always fit lunch before 2pm? - Lots of vegetables. Crispy veggies too, not the gross wilted ones you get at other places.  They have all the traditional orders, from chow mein, sweet & sour pork, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, fried rice, hot & sour soup, it goes on and on. Prices range from $7.25-$9.95. Lunch is from $5.95-$6.50, which includes fried or steamed rice & chow mein & egg drop soup (dine-in only). Complete family dinners start from $24.95 & they serve Thai tea or fruit smoothies with boba.  Most importantly, they've always been timely. Food is served fast, carry-out is ready, and delivery is always punctual.   Tasty, affordable, reliable. It's not gourmet, but it's fresh, clean Chinese for a great price! I'll be back soon :)"}

I placed an online order and my food arrived 25 minutes later. It was so fast that when my doorbell rang, I was shocked and even asked who is it? because I didn't think it could be my dinner lol. The delivery guy was very nice and prepared with a pen and receipt.   I ordered the dinner for one so I could get a little variety to try. It comes with an entree, rice or noodles, soup, and a small appetizer. I chose general tso's chicken, fried rice, and crab rangoon. (I'm not a big soup fan) the Rangoon didn't come with the usual red sauce, which was a let down. Everything else was pretty good for the price. Keep in mind, this is fast food Chinese! The fact that they delivery, aren't expensive, and food was pretty good, they get three stars. I would give it 3.5 if I could."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Went here yesterday with some friends because of the positive reviews and I'd say this place is decent.  I ended up ordering the stuffing waffle which is basically a waffle made from stuffing that is topped with mashed potatoes and turkey with brown gravy. I decided to order this since it is currently one of their specials. The waffle itself was pretty good in terms of flavor because I was actually able to taste the stuffing. I loved how crispy the waffle was, but unfortunately half of the waffle ended up being soggy because of the moisture and heat from being covered by the mashed potatoes and turkey. I think the dish would have been better if everything was plated separately instead of on a stack. The portion is pretty big and I'd say it's enough for two people. The turkey was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor. I wish I had more gravy for my mashed potatoes because all of the gravy just ended up on the turkey itself. No one likes eating mashed potatoes without gravy right?   Overall the food was decent, but the service was pretty good. The waiter was very personable and kept an eye on our table. I'd probably come back here and try some of their other dishes."}

Also, I have a mushroom allergy and after eating almost half the sandwich, the last couple bites tasted strange so I opened it to notice mushrooms.  I had to get my check and leave so I could take some meds.  The fries were really salty and seemed old, I'd say the pickle had less salt lol.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "China Tango is one of the Chinese restaurants that I dine in before the 4 pm lunch special ends. It has been open approximately a year (used to dine here when it was Pick Up Stix).   The atmosphere is more restaurant than take out. There is more of a wait person presence.    Before you order your food, they bring you egg drop soup. I hope it is included with all dine in meals. Not too much later, they bring crunchy noodles with duck sauce. If you order soda, they will fill it at the fountain for you. Last but not least, they will deliver your entree with the included fried rice and chow mein noodles.   The lunch special tops off at $6.50. Soda is not included. The bill for the lunch special with a soda totals up to close to $10 before the tip (a tip jar).    I rate China Tango four stars. The quality, starting from the crunchy noodles to the fortune cookie is high.   A word of advice: Look at the menu outside. Once your inside, they'll sit you down, and before you know it they'll be serving you egg drop soup. This could make some people, myself included, feel awkward if there is nothing here that suits your taste."}

As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and sat immediately at the counter. The counter seats look directly into the kitchen, and I really liked that I could watch the food being cooked and listen to the interactions between the servers and the kitchen staff. The kitchen staff even greeted me and interacted with me throughout my visit there, which I personally enjoy because it really makes me feel welcome. Service and comfort are the biggest things to me when it comes to rating and reviews, and this place nailed both categories.  The food was just as good! I had the challa french toast breakfast special, which came with eggs, bacon, has browns, french toast, and an English muffin. If I had eaten anything at all today, I would probably not have been able to finish it all. The French toast was delicious and the fruit on top of it added some good sweetness and tart to balance it out (bananas and strawberries). The bacon was perfect and the eggs were cooked just right. The hash browns were well done and a little too crispy for me, but this being my first time it was a learning experience. I'm sure if I ordered them differently they would have nailed it. Absolutely wonderful.  Overall, between the great service, friendly interactions, and delicious food, this place got an easy 5 star from me. I'll be back for sure and it will be an easy recommendation to make for friends/family looking for a good breakfast here in henderson."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I had this last minute craving for crispy honey walnut shrimp, so I took to Yelp to find the nearest spot that offered that. From the many pics of past customers who also ordered this from China Tango, the pictures looked promising...   I called in my take out order and within 15 minutes I arrived to pick it up. China Tango is located in the Smith's shopping center a few doors down from Rubio's. There's a decent amount of parking directly in the front. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side with about 8 tables inside. Customer service is decent.   So let's talk food:   1) Honey Walnut Shrimp- I would give this 3.5 stars. The shrimps weren't as crispy as I like. This may be because I didn't dig into them right away. Might give them another try. Too much sauce was also found on the shrimp. Oh and this is expensive, $11.99 for this dish.   2) Mongolian Beef- xxxspicy! This was also just okay for me. Too much sauce, wasn't spicy at all and there were noodles with this? Weird. The meat was slithery. Man, I really wished this was good.   All in all, I don't think this will be my go to Chinese restaurant- still on the look out for my go to.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Tried Metro out as wife said this place had great reviews and it was a brand new place. Hosts were nice and it was a short wait to get seated as it didn't look like they were too busy (Sunday afternoon).   After being seated we had to wait an extremely long time (~10 mins) before we were greeted by a server. Guy was very nice, took our drinks, and let us know that our actual server will check on us soon. During this wait we overheard the table next to us asking for a manager to complain about the service. Honestly, this should have been our first red flag. After waiting ANOTHER 5-10 mins our actual server showed up and took our orders. She didn't know how to work the ordering tool that well which was strange (Place just opened. Didn't you get trained?).  For the drinks, I tried the sweetened peach tea and it was super (extremely) sweet. Mixed it half and half with wife's water and it was still a bit too sweet but very tasty.  For the food, I got the Monte Cristo with chips which was excellent in taste and portion. The berry sauce it came with was equally amazing. I would recommend that dish if you're going to come here.   The wife got the fish and chips which were terrible. I thought she was exaggerating so I tried some but they really were awful. The fish were soggy on the outside instead of crispy, they were totally bland and the tater sauce tasted more like relish in a cup. Would not recommend that dish to anyone. My wife just ended up having part of my Monte Cristo and left almost the entirety of the fish and chips.   Mother-in-law got the bacon mushroom swiss burger with fries. She said the burger was extremely good but the fries were already cold when they reached the table. Brother-in-law got the bold city burger which he said was excellent (and looked excellent) but same issue with the fries.  During the meal we were checked up on by a few people, none of which were our server. Unfortunately no one refilled waters or sodas even once during the meal. The original person who took our drinks left the check for us which is weird (where is our server?). After finishing we waited another 5 minutes after the bus boy took our plates before the server sort of stumbled passed our table, noticed we were done, and asked us if we wanted a box for the fish and chips and took our payment.  In the end, this was a disappointing experience. The burgers and sandwiches may be good but a lot of work needs to be done with the service and I don't know how they could possibly fix the disgrace that they call their fish and chips.  Tl;Dr Service was bad. Burgers and sandwiches were good and the only thing that saved the meal. Fish and chips were a disgrace."}

Honestly, it's just a step up from Denny's. Their menu items offered here is better, ambiance is nicer, but that's just about it.  Came here couple times over the past few months, hoping I'd find something I can be excited about and tried different dishes each time. Nothing memorable to me, well, except pass on the grits here, the texture and taste are off. trust me.  Mr B loves their Monte Cristo. I had liked it too. But that last visit, it was heavy on the grease. The jam that it's served with was good too. I assumed it was made from scratch from what I read. But when I asked our server for more, she looked and pointed to the packaged jellies on our table and said just open those, they're the same thing. Okaay.  Service is friendly. Nothing more or less. It was on point when the servers had their trainers hovering over them. Last two visits, got seated right away, but it took more than five minutes for a server to acknowledge our existence. Plus they were forgetful.   And whoever was the lead giving their employees evaluations, should use a little more discretion. Like do not do the employee evals at the boothes with patrons within earshot. Real tacky.  Employee got rated 3 cause she needs to smile more... which may be true, but how about how unprofessional evaluator was? I didn't need to hear that.

The beef was steamed and almost gelatinous like. It had no flavor. Same thing with the chicken. Steamed no flavor. The rangoons had no crab. This place was just awful. No flavor or love put into the dishes whatsoever. It tasted as if they steam everything, set it under a warmer and add whichever sauce to it at the last minute. I'd be surprised if there were a single wok being used in this restaurant. Boo :("}

Me and my girlfriend ate here twice while visiting my grandparents at the end of September, it was great service and great food, 4 or 5 stars is what they rated based off of the regular diner experience but what really impressed me was the kindness they showed in the wake of one of the most tragic nights of our lives. My girlfriend and I were trapped inside the route 91 harvest festival the night of the shooting, we endured a horrifying ordeal while escaping the venue that night, we hardly slept when we arrived at my grandparents house that night but as the dust settled the next day my grandparents took us here for breakfast. I ate maybe 3 bites of my food, my girlfriend maybe double that, through the course of normal waitress conversation and the fact this was world news and we were in the town next to it only 12 hours later the waitress found out what happened, she talked to her manager, she talked to the regional manager I believe it was who just happened to be stopping by. They paid for all of our meals and extended their thoughts to us in this terrible time, they didn't have to do any of that but they did, that's a company that is run by real people unlike many others nowadays. The Polaroid at the bottom of the collage is all of us on our first visit that weekend before the shooting."}

My only advice is to A) ensure you call the right location if you're doing a pick up order *I've mixed up locations before* and B) ensure you look/read the menu. There are some noodle dishes that are for example crunchy with a gravy veggie/meat topping that you would miss if you weren't reading the description (I did that but was still super happy with my mistake. It's a dim sum dish that I order at my dim sum joint anyways ;) ). Anywhoodles, delicious food for a wicked cheap price."}

Our server was John A and he was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Definitely seemed as though he had tried everything and was speaking from experience.   I ordered one of their blackboard specials, a stuffing waffle covered in mashed potatoes, turkey, and gravy. It was really good and humongous. My wife had the Monte cristo, which was deep fried and delicious.   I don't think I've been to a restaurant with such happy and nice staff before. They were all going over the top to make sure we were doing well. It was almost a little too much for my taste, but I can't fault them for that.    It's a solid place. You can tell they care.

My husband had the fried chicken and waffles. Our waitress mixed the sweet and spicy sauce (maple syrup and hot sauce) for his chicken and the strawberry butter that came with the waffles was delicious!  Everything tasted SO GOOD. I wasn't sure what quality the food would be but it was far and above any other 'diner' I've been to. I took the bananas out of the Yohala and it was perfect.

I quickly surveyed the small restaurant and it did look very clean. We all thought that what we ordered tasted ok...not over the top. I'm a big fan of honey walnut shrimp but the way they prepared their version was different than what I'm used to. Most places I've been to have used a mayo glaze but at China Tango they use a mustard like glaze? The wonton soup was tasty.  Should I return, I'll dine at the restaurant and I'd like to give their chow fun or chow mein a try."}

I order the crab Rangoon, General Tso chicken ( in spicy), eggplant tofu stir fry, salt and pepper chicken ( in spicy ). It comes with a side of white rice, so there is plenty of food for 2 and for seconds as well! Highly recommend."}

Our server was helpful and we both picked the same entree in spite of all the choices. So...San Fran Eggs Benedict for both of us and I removed the Canadian bacon cause I wasn't paying attention or I would have asked for spinach instead. Asked for my eggs to be poached to a medium so the whites are done and they got that just right. They were good but we both thought the soggy English muffins were a bit of a bummer. Missed the crunchy texture because the eggs, tomato and avocado all soft, needed to be crisp muffin. Hash browns were crispy although a tad oily for me. All in all we both cleaned our plates and are looking forward to coming back and trying some other lunchie choices. Great place!"}

I really enjoyed the vegetables, they were tasty! Everything I ate didn't taste frozen or if it was sitting out!

The guy handling the money doesn't handle the food and vice versa. I never have to worry about looking for the table with the least amount if food left on it from previous guests, because the staff keep them clean.    The staff there are very kind and are patient as i always want to try something different so I may take a few minutes to figure out what I want or if I actually want it. The same people are always there and the guy at the front knows what my co worker is going to order when we get there. If you dine in you get bottomless fried wonton noodles which are so good! They are also very quick; when you order, the food is out in less than ten minutes.   Rice is a big thing with me as I feel it can make a meal taste great or make you want to throw it in the garbage, but can't cause that's a waste. The rice, both fried and steamed is very tasty and not dry which is one thing I hate about rice at other restaurants. Also the rice isn't mushy. I usually get sautéed vegetables and I don't want my meal to end. The vegetables are so fresh and crunchy and the sauce they use is so magnificent I love it! Their chow mien also tastes great and I'm not too much of a chow mien person.     Lunch specials are very inexpensive and are reasonably portioned. I almost always have left overs. The time for the linch specials goes till 4p, so if you go close to that time, you can have dinner too!  Overall, I choose this place over any other Chinese place in the area and I've been to almost all of them. Can't beat the cleanliness, service, prices and of course the food!"}

This location had the same warm inviting feel as the other locations. Very organized and very clean and definitely living up to the standards.  I went ahead and started off with the mango iced tea that was suggested. Perfectly sweet and refreshing for a warm day. My friend had the orange juice. Definitely not fresh squeezed but pretty good.  I want to head with the daily special and had the shrimp po boy. The whole sandwich was a hit from start to finish. Perfectly golden fried shrimp tossed in a spicy mayo. Fresh tomatoes and green onions on a perfectly fresh roll. Served with fries. For $12 this is a sure hit. Shrimp were fried perfectly and not greasy at all. Loved the chipotles ranch sauce that comes with it. Gave it a solid 5/5  My friend had the vegetable omelette without the cheese. Fresh vegetable medley filled this golden fluffy omelette. Served with Home style potatoes. Everything went well together. The potatoes were rejuvenated. More than likely prepared early in the day and then heated. Way to dark and greasy but everything else was great.  Great place for breakfast lunch or dinner. Staff was friendly. Definitely a step above any regular coffee shop."}

She got a side of bacon making it the most expensive dish at the table. She said it was strangely dry inside and our waffles at home are better. The Monte Cristo was huge, but the batter was very thick and grease would run down her hand when she bit into it. My Reuben had a good amount of corned beef. I had mentioned that the photos on Yelp varied greatly as to the amount of meat. The waitress confirmed that it does vary a lot. I asked for the fuller version. The corned beef was good, but the sandwich as a whole was kinda strange. First of all it was very juicy for a sandwich. Juice (juice, grease, sauce?) would run down my chin when I bit into it. Usually you can easily identify the cheese, sauerkraut and sauce but in this I couldn't. It seemed like it was all one thing. It was also really strong and overpowered the meat. Very messy to eat. We went away very disappointed."}

She was not only attentive but very pleasant and fun to chat with--and it was obvious that she takes pride in her work and making customers happy!   They have a lot of great menu selections and serve breakfast all day so anything on the menu is served at any time during the day.  Missing diners from the Northeast, its nice to see diners out west which are rare!  So glad we gave Metro Diner a try!"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "When we first started going to this location a year ago, I couldn't have imagined I would be writing THIS review, but here goes... It used to be the lines were out the door, at least a 20-30 minute wait.  Once inside and seated, the kitchen was bustling, service staff was all over, customers were all taking and the place was ELECTRIC! Now, none of the above applies. Kitchen, quiet, and the food is sub par; a FAR cry from what it was, and that's amazing considering there isn't much of a wait anymore and the kitchen cooked a lot better when it was busy!  Today, my special country fried steak breakfast was flat out BURNT and they tried to conceal that by putting the worst side down and hiding the rest of it under gravy. Problem is, burnt is burnt and you discover that when you first cut into the damn thing! It was SO bad, my server saw it and without even saying a word( she was totally embarrassed, so it's not like she was trying to be rude) she took it away to show management and the kitchen.  Problem is NO ONE from management came over to the table, NO ONE!!!! If they had, they'd have also discovered the hash browns were equally as offensive; SCORCHED!! Every since this Lynn became a manager at this location the place seems to have fallen apart, from the hostess station and hostesses and the kitchen.  We love the server crew, ALL of them are wonderful (shout out to Ida, Kyle and April, all of whom are top notch and apologies to the others we haven't had the pleasure of meeting) and you can see they bust their butts to make up for things. But folks, the experience starts at the hostess station and ends with the kitchen, and when 2 of the 3 fundamentals of making and keeping a great restaurant are as jacked up as this one is, it's over!  The writing is on the wall in this place, and it's fixable. Question is, will they?!  I was HIGHLY put off that this manager was talking to the next table about the fish and chips when I ate NOTHING and not so much as an apology or is there something else we can get you instead!  You may very well have lost my families business and we have been coming here at LEAST once a week for over a year and are HEAVY tippers!  There have been several other incidents in the past  I haven't mentioned, but like a bad marriage, you can love it, but there comes a time when you gotta leave it and move on."}

Purse hooks beneath the counter. A black and white check tile floor. Diner favorites such as fried chicken, meatloaf, pot pie and burgers. Even some oldies (late 60s and maybe early 70s) playing on the PA. The only thing not part of the throw back feel of Metro Diner is the tablet device the wait staff record your order on; which, to quote the waitress, is the worst invention. I tend to agree.  Any how, I ordered what is in my mind a trifecta burger. That is to say a bacon, mushroom and swiss burger. I ordered it cooked to medium and it came out as such. The juicy beef tasted fresh. The cheese was melted perfect and gooey. The three slices of bacon were thick cut and came perfectly crisp. The mushrooms were fresh and shroomy. The rest of the toppings were simply shredded lettuce and one slice of tomato. Really it was just a generic burger. But there is nothing wrong with a generic burger if it is done right. The fries on the side were fries. Thick cut and natural with skins on.  Usually I would stop with the burger and fries. But the entire time I was waiting for my food and eating I could not help but stare at the chalk board on the far side of the restaurant. One dessert written on the board was taunting me. Bananas foster cheesecake. Um, yes please. So I ordered dessert today. It was good but not as good as I had hoped it would be. Basically it was a cheese cake with bananas in it. It was like eating banana pudding with the texture of cheesecake. It would have been nice if it reflected a true bananas foster more with a booze flavor. Regardless, it was a good dessert.  The diner was about half full today. Fairly busy I suppose. And the entire wait staff was running around like mad serving everybody at every table. They were friendly and attentive. There is a sign above the bar that reads something along the lines of Where the locals eat. And there were obvious locals here. The waitress knew a group that came in when I was finishing my cheesecake. She knew them by name and knew their drink orders before they even sat down. This is a good measure of quality customer service. Metro Diner may be a chain but they truly feel like a neighborhood establishment. I'm a fan."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Wow--what happened to the service here???  Decided to take my father, who was visiting from out of town, out to lunch here on a Sunday. We were seated right away, but everything else went downhill from there. We ordered a club sandwich and the fish and chips, a seemingly straightforward order. After waiting for our food and not having seen our waiter for about 25-30 minutes, my father finally was able to flag our waiter down and asked him when our food would be ready. The waiter seemed confused and said he did not see that our orders had been entered and asked us what we wanted again. After he was gone for a few minutes, he came back and informed us that the kitchen had told him our food would be out right away. We saw several tables who were seated after us receive their food. Probably after waiting another 5-10 minutes we decided it was time to go. We were getting up from the table when the waiter hurriedly delivered the club sandwich and said the fish would be out soon. We told him we would take our food to go. No way were we going to sit there for much longer. Someone, who was not our waiter, came and brought the boxed sandwich to our table and said, Sorry about the wait. Then finally, about 40-50 minutes after we placed our order (the first time?), the boxed fish and chips came out. The waiter apologized and said that the kitchen had burned the fish and that was the cause for the delay. He told us there would be no charge for our lunch.  I was so embarrassed to have brought my father to this place and I would certainly feel embarrassed and angry to return to eat here. The food tasted pretty good, but the terrible service is what stood out. I'm not sure if our order was lost, never entered, or the kitchen burned the fish that was the cause of a 40-50 minute wait time on a club sandwich and fish and chips. Ordinarily I'm pretty forgiving of sluggish service if the place is very crowded. While the diner was busy (but no wait time at the front), this long of a wait for a club sandwich and fish and chips seems kind of excessive (especially after seeing tables seated after us being served their food and finishing their meals all in this time span). Although I appreciate our waiter saying there would be no charge, it is kind of disappointing that unhappy customers were never apologized to by a manager. Funnily enough our waiter said he hoped we would come back another time at the end of all this! Sadly, I don't think I'll return."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Let's start off by saying that I have never written a review before. China Tango is the first restaurant that I felt deserving. My husband and I have consistently ordered from China Tango for the past few months... Honestly sad to say but average 2 to 3 times a week and they have not disappointed us. We have only used the delivery service so we are only able to review that service and the food.   Order:  We usually order through yelp but a couple of times we ordered over the phone. Both options are pretty speedy with no complications.  Delivery:  The best delivery service ever! They are soooo speedy. From the time we order to the food arriving at our house about 20-30 mins top.   Service: Exceptional! They are very speedy and thorough. China tango has NOT made a mistake on any of our orders. And that's a lot to say since it has probably been more then 25 orders. Each and every requests we have made have been carried out. This last time we asked if they could make orange shrimp (not on their menu) since I do not eat meat and without hesitation, the guy over the phone says of course. And it was AMAZING.   FOOD THE BEST PART:  OMG China Tango is the best chinese food that I have eaten and I've eaten Chinese food everywhere! Everything is delicious! My husband loves their general tsao chicken and orange chicken. My favorite is their salt and pepper calamari and shrimp, kung pao shrimp, and sweet and sour soup! They have the BEST sweet and sour soup and the best thing is that you can choose your spice level.  Overall,  If you are on the fence of trying china tango, Do It!!! Exceptional service and food.

After opening everything up at home we were shorted one if the sides of bacon.  Both of our eggs tasted so watery I have to believe they either came out of a carton or they use water to add volume to the eggs. Second the hashbrowns....not a speck of seasoning on them..the blandest potatoes I ever tasted. The larger pieces were hard in the middle. Omelet was ok...barely ok...eggs like I said were watery but the fillings were....so so...my daughter ciuldnt eat the breakfast pie....eggs were so watery..mushrooms were soggy. We gave hers to the dogs..they seemed to enjoy it. The biscuit was delicious. That was my favorite part of the meal. Maybe they cater more to dining in....I dont know.

My family liked their meals but I wasn't fond of the ruben. It had a strange sour flavor that wasn't from the kraut, possibly from the pastrami seasonings and they had munster cheese chunks (despite Swiss described on the menu) that weren't melted.

Good food, large portions, great value, and superb customer service is enough to make me a repeat customer. Heck, it's enough to give an establishment 5 Stars.  I've been to all of the Metro Diner locations in Las Vegas.  A couple of things are guaranteed whenever I dine at Metro Diner  #1:  I am always going to order a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup #2:  I am always leaving stuffed #3:  The service is excellent  Metro Diner has a few signature items like the Chicken & Waffles, Monte Cristo, Chicken Pot Pie, Bold Burger, and Shrimp Grits.  The Chicken Pot Pie is a must try as well as their Chicken & Waffles.  My go-to meals at Metro Diner is their Meat Lover's Omelet and a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup.  The Meat Lover's Omelet is not on the menu, but they will create it upon request.  Metro Diner has also created a protein only breakfast for me, which consist of eggs, bacon, hamburger patty or chicken breast, and sausage.  The good stuff!!  Metro Diner is consistent when it comes to servicing their guest.  Regardless if they're jammed packed or dead slow, I have never received anything less than stellar service.   Great Job, Metro Diner!!  TIP #1:  Hours (Sun-Thurs 7:00 AM-8:00 PM, Fri-Sat 7:00 AM-9:00 PM) TIP #2:  Metro Diner is great about substitutions.  TIP #3:  Daily Double.  Two visits in one day equal a 10% discount on the 2nd visit."}

When I saw that there was going to be one down the street from me, I knew that this was going to be a good. Diners are my kind of thing. Breakfast all day!/  I've had this place bookmarked ever since I found out they have chicken and waffles. I FREAKIN' LOVE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Growing up in close proximity to a Roscoe's (Long Beach, waddup!) has altered my idea of chicken and waffles for life-- let's just say that the bar is set pretty high.   Metro Diner's chicken and waffles were top notch. I wouldn't say that they are my all time favorite, but the fried chicken was damn good. The skin was light and crispy, just the way I like it. The waffles were good. I enjoyed the strawberry butter on top, it was a nice addition to a classic combination. The server offered to make me a spicy sauce for my chicken (how am I supposed to say no to that, I love me some spicy!). She came back with a small saucer and poured in Louisiana hot sauce and maple syrup. I had my doubts but wow what a great combination for the fried chicken. The chicken and waffles meal is about $15 and is a decent enough portion to share. Our table also ordered the pot roast dinner. It was a little on the salty side, but I thought it was tender and juicy and went well with the hefty portion of mashed potatoes.  Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Metro and I'll be back again. The table next to us ordered the cobbler and that was enough to convince me to come back even if it was just for dessert.

It wasn't close to home but we thought the food was yummy so a little out of the way we drove.... So I was happily surprised when driving in Green Valley one day looking for somewhere to eat - I spotted China Tango.  We each tried a lunch special which consisted of free fried wontons,egg drop soup, eggrolls,fried rice, fried noodles (chow mein) and General Tsou's Chicken & sweet N sour chicken.  Fried wontons & egg flower soup - BLEH.... Veggie Eggrolls were filled with cabbage only and the cabbage was not even soft/cooked inside so it was a weird texture.  I asked if we could have white meat chicken instead of dark meat and the server said sure. I was happy about that.... Not for long - the pieces of the chicken looked big but the actual chicken pieces were so tiny that most of the chicken pieces were just crispy breading. Disappointing!!!!  The fried rice was OK but the fried noodles were bland and yucky. I don't enjoy fried noodles when it looks like spaghetti not chow mein noodles. The server even walked by us and said Guess you didn't like the fried noodles... He suggested to us that the next time we come we should just order double fried rice. I'm not too sure if they'll be a next time....  The guy behind the counter was nice and they were accommodating in reguards to the request of white chicken and if my daughter can eat her slice of pizza inside but the food just wasn't what we remembered enjoying like at the Anthem location and my fortune inside my fortune cookie was freaky- it just said Learn Chinese..... The BF thinks my fortune was just prepairing me for the future."}

I love how large their menu is!! My order was ready right away. The fried rice was seriously delicious!! Great flavor and quality! The crab rangoons were some of the best I've ever had! The flavor and texture was so delicious!!! They were spot on, the crab was super delicious and I loved how the top edges were crispy and then the bottom was soft and decadent. I was very impressed with the appetizer! They had plenty of seating in the restaurant and it looked cleaner than most Chinese restaurants I've been to. I'll definitely be back to try more of their items! So glad I found a new Chinese spot!!"}

This place is Clean, Service is quick even though it was crowded, the Waiters, Hostesses and Staff was so Friendly and Professional. We all ordered different food items and they were delicious, I recommend the Chicken and Waffles, with Chicken Biscuit on the side and Peach sweet tea. The Manager was very nice professional and welcoming more restaurants should have people like her and that staff. Thank you Metro Diner."}

They received good reviews so it was our turn to try it out. The place gets really busy but we were able to be seated right away. It's very clean and has a contemporary country type of feel. Every employee we met was energetic and friendly. Kyle our server was great. The bussers and the hostesses where real top-notch. Even the owner Peter came over and was super friendly and helpful and it's good to see the owner out there helping and in the public eye. There are lots of food choices and I apologize to my vegan friends but not too many vegan choices. I had the oatmeal with bananas, home fries and rye toast with jelly. I can't say enough about the service as it really was perfect. The food portions are large which is great because who doesn't love leftovers. My son got the scrambled eggs with hash browns and toast and my wifey ordered the veggie omelet with home fries and rye toast. Now my food was great mind you would doesn't seem like it's a difficult meal but I've seen people mess up oatmeal. It was absolutely good. I then have to go with my better Parts opinion and she was very happy with the food. My son really enjoyed his food too it's kind of hard getting a real opinion out of a teenager but by the way he ate I'm guessing he really liked it. We all said we would come back here again. So Henderson Metro Diner good job! Two thumbs up very high! You also get the Boom Shaka Laka Laka Boom award 4 an overall five star experience!"}

A chef had to ask the waitstaff to ask me for my drink order. Nobody helped me as far as ordering my food. I walked out instead of waiting and hoping they would improve my service.

They had a decent crowd already  there because duh the foods amazing! Idk if I can say the same for the staff there. Me n my daughter waited for 15 min for our waitress to come to the table. Her name was supposed to be Nina or somethin. I'm never met her. While I waited a waitress by the name of Ida asked if we've been helped. I told her no so she took our drink orders and said she'll have Nina come over to us. No Nina. Ida returned back and said no worries, I'll take your order and she also apologized for the wait. Wow. It wasn't even her fault. 2 different staff members brought us our food which was incorrect but I got more food than I was supposed to. As long as I wasn't charged. The lady placing the food in front of us told me to hurry up and grab my plate cause it's hot. HURRY UP???!  Well bitch ur a waitress wear a damn waitress sleeve. U can make them out of a sock! I eventually grabbed the plate but I was hesitant because it wasn't correct. Smh.. anyway I guess she tried to argue with me. Big no no. I just wanted to make sure i didn't have someone else's order from another table n i wanted butter not an argument. The manager is nice.. he walks around and ask how you doin.

There are so many great choices , our server was patient and great ( didn't get her name but she was Hispanic and very very helpful in narrowing our choices ) I opted for the American omelette with biscuit and a side of gravy my friend ordered a big breakfast plate and to start off we had to share a cup of baked potato soup, the soup came out piping hot and dressed with cheese and bacon and tasted amazing, along comes the omelette stuffed full of paper thin steak, mushrooms,onions and cheese ( I added American , it's the way to go ). It was also served with home fries which were big chunks of potatoes that were perfectly cooked and crispy on outside and hot and soft inside ! The combo of flavors in omelette were on point ! When my fork hit the cheese pockets I was in heaven !! My friend did share a piece of her waffle which was perfectly crisp and delicious , try it with strawberry butter !!

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "China Tang-NO.   . Went on Sunday 2-7-16 at 6PM.  $33.24 got us a thai tea, a coke, a combo platter appetizer, an individual dinner, and a chicken in hot garlic sauce entree.  The restaurant is located in the Smith's shopping center on Green Valley between Pebble & the 215.   . The restaurant is in fair condition and poor cleanliness. The table was sticky and the soap dispenser in the men's room was duct-taped to the wall.  Our server was prompt and friendly.   .  $7.95 Combo platter- An assortment of (2) egg roll, (2) butterfly shrimp, (2) crab rangoons and (2) paper wrapped chicken & BBQ pork.  The eggs rolls were filled with what I can only assume was a mixture of coleslaw and black pepper.  I've never had an eggroll like this and did not enjoy it although it was nicely fried.  The crab rangoons were my favorite part of the whole meal.  They have a good amount of filling and although devoid of crab they were very tasty.  The shrimp were not butterflied as their menu describes and were not de-veined.  They were fried nicely but I'm not a big fan of eating poo.  The paper wrapped chicken was really just like a chicken sausage wrapped in tiny triangles of tinfoil.  They were actually pretty tasty.  The barbecue pork was disgusting...tiny slivers of dried up pork sauteed in the same gooey pink sauce that is traditionally served with crab rangoons.  I was praying before I went to sleep that I didn't get food poisoning from anything I just mentioned.  .  $9.55 Individual dinner- I chose chow mein, crab rangoons, wonton soup, and orange chicken.  The chow mein was the super-cheap spaghetti kind with bean sprouts, green onions, and maybe a tiny sliver of carrot here or there.  Noodles were hot and had sub-par flavor but were fairly mushy.  The orange chicken was probably the worst I've ever had...very freezer burned and I was done after 4 bites.  The wonton soup was served boiling hot but the broth was terrible...it tasted like my breath when I wake up in the morning.  The wontons were complete mush and were so gross that I spit it out into my napkin.   .  $9.25 Chicken in hot garlic sauce- Sliced white meat chicken w/ carrots, mushrooms, diced bell pepper and onion stir fried in spicy Szechuan sauce.  My hubs told me the chicken was rubbery and the veggies were cheap and not cooked well.  It was an enormous amount of food for the price, however.   .  This place is not serving high quality or tasty food.  I am disappointed that I wasted over thirty bucks here.  I felt bad for our server who boxed up the leftovers knowing full well that they were going in the dumpster.  This is the kind of place where you wait til the waitress walks away and joke about the neighborhood cats going missing and I am shocked that it has 4 stars."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Fine, unless you are a vegetarian. We keep giving this place the benefit of the doubt, but I am finally done. They have very few tofu dishes on the menu, and most Chinese restaurants have no problem substituting tofu for chicken or beef in most of their regular dishes. Here, if you order sweet and sour tofu it is a special order and takes twice as long as other meals. That would be ok if it actually WAS a special order, made special in some way, but what you are given is a plate of dry, fried tofu and a side of sauce. Not sure how this constitutes special but ok.  Our last time here was on a particularly busy night, and (not smart of us) we didn't check the order until we got home and realized they left out a $7 order of fried rice. We had to drive back to the restaurant to pick up the rice, while the rest of our food got cold at home, and we were offered nothing as consolation for our troubles, other than the rice they forgot and a half-hearted apology. Free meal next time? Free appetizer for our trouble? No, nothing.  We won't be back."}

The second attempt for lunch was much better. Today we also dined in for lunch. I ordered the chicken salad, which was flavored decently, however I encountered a grisly piece which ended that meal. My husband and daughter both ordered chicken fingers which came over cooked and were hard. The service again was decent, drink refills were brought by without being prompted, it still felt as though our waitress was rushed, perhaps too many tables?!

I opted for the meatloaf dinner that comes with mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini. The meatloaf,  along with the fried chicken and waffles are their most requested dinners and I can see why. Everyone of us absolutely loved the food....fresh, hot and perfectly done.  The only downside: the coffee could be a little richer with a little more body, but that's how we saw it.  The service is professionally served by people who know what they're doing.Be sure  to ask for Leah or Darlene, both outstanding servers.  If you haven't been here yet,  be sure to try METRO DINER.

He asked what places to eat were over in the Smith's shopping center, and we meandered across the freeway.  We noticed China Tango was new, but I saw Jennifer C.'s review and knew at least a big plate of rice included with a dish would make Eric happy.  It looks like we should order at the counter, but the cashier handed us a menu and told us to sit at a booth since we were dine-in.  He gave us a styrofoam bowl of fried wonton strips and a plastic sauce cup of sweet n sour.  We got small styrofoam cups of water, styrofoam plates, and mini plastic forks.  We decided on egg drop soup (I was skeptical because soup was pricey like $5.25) and ginger and onion beef.  The soup came out immediately in a big plastic tub with a plastic spoon (not a ladle).  It had corn in it and was hot, just hard to serve in these small styrofoam bowls we had and little plastic spoons to eat it with.    The ginger and onion beef had lots of green onions (good), bamboo shoots, red onions, and ginger.  Without a doubt, we received a huge plate of white rice.  The beef though - it looked good, but the texture was horrible.  You could call it cheap meat but I could not chew it.  I tried a few times and ended up spitting it out each time.  I ate the green onions with my rice instead.  At least the sauce was okay.  For the inedible dish and expensive soup, it was over $18.  Imagine if each person got a dish, yikes!  There is no value for your money.  Just lots and lots of styrofoam...! Will not return!"}

Then we had the fried wontons  (not pictured :( ) those were amazing and we actually fought over them we should have ordered a double order next time I know. Then we had the hot and sour soup which was super super yummy full of flavor and quality ingredients. Then we had our main course which we ordered the shrimp fried rice the kung Pau combination and the general chicken and as a bonus we got the Hong Kong chow mein (we didn't order it but the girl thought we did so she gave it to us for free). The general chicken was absolutely phenomenal I wish we had ordered two of them instead of the kung Pou combination. The flavors of the general chicken is a mix of sweet and spicy deliciousness. Such an amazing dish the kung Pou though left alot to be desired it lacked flavor that makes you want to take another bite it was also filled with more veggies then meat which is always a negative when your paying for a meat and seafood dish. The shrimp fried rice was gobbled up by my kids like they were eating for the apocalypse. The Hong Kong chow mein was okay there seemed to be a few bites of really good flavor then blandness which is not alot of fun to eat.

The shrimp itself tasted great. Was the perfect blend of spice and flavor.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "UPDATE REGARDING MANAGEMENT-I am updating my review regarding Peter and Tony, the manager partners, who have gone above and beyond to rectify this situation. I truly appreciate their time and care they have shown regarding this situation. They both have reached out personally to ensure they could discuss this experience and I have updated my rating just purely because of the two of them.    Absolute WORST experience EVER. We visited the Rainbow location last year before all the other locations opened and it was great! And we've been to the one on Serene several times and love it!! Don't even waste your time to come to this store. The manager, Lynn, spends her time with two other employees staring at their expo screen confused yet smiling and laughing as they point around trying to figure out the mess of their kitchen while then harassing customers outside the restaurant after we left!  Waited a good 8-10 minutes for our drink order and just put in our food order as well because it took that long for her to come to us, but the waitress was not our issue this visit. We ordered two Philly cheese steaks no onions, a French dip and the holy divoli burger medium rare. Then waited at least 20 minutes for her to continually tell us it's coming don't worry they're a little slammed up there. Then we notice her talking to the manager, Lynn, as they are looking at the order screen with one other girl in a pink shirt all looking confused and pointing to the screen several times. Lynn then comes over to us to tell us the kitchen messed up the medium rare burger and over cooked it so I'm the Mom and I made the call to just remake everything but it's at the top of the screen it will be right out. That sounded kind of nice due to not wanting one person to wait to eat, but we were slightly curious as to how they even knew they over cooked the burger? And my husband isn't picky enough to throw a fit over a slightly over cooked burger if they would have just explained when they brought it out; but we sure threw a fit afterwards. It then took 25 more minutes and our order was still not there! We finally see the burger up there and one of the sandwiches. Wait a few more minutes. Then the one of the sandwiches gets taken to another table!!! Mind you 7 other tables who got there after us got their orders while we were waiting. As soon as that other sandwich got delivered to another table and the burger that started it all continued to sit up there the waitress came over and we said,this is just crazy. If that's not our food up there we are just going to leave. She just walked away. Three minutes later and still no food nor has Lynn or anyone come by to say anything at all, we got up and left. I turned around to come back and ask for the name of the manager (Lynn didn't have a name tag on and at that time I didn't know her name). She then proceeds to chase me as I walk out the door shouting MA'AM MA'AM! And then followed me outside harassing me saying, I already paid for your food myself and it's fine just come back in and eat it! We didn't go there because we couldn't afford our meal! We just wanted to have a nice dinner. The B food grade on the wall on the way out was another clear indicator we should have just went somewhere else. I have never been so upset by a poor restaurant or service I've received. I've worked in the food industry and completely understand things happen. But Lynn's manager skills and behavior was completely unacceptable. As I got in the car another customer walked out and said, I just want to apologize for that restaurant. She was completely out of line. Very true. I will be calling their manager partner, Peter tomorrow morning."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Let's keep it simple up front: I'm really not happy with the Chinese food at China Tango Bistro--it's pretty bland all around-- but the people who run it are really nice.  So, two stars.   Now for more details: I really wanted China Tango Bistro to be great since it's on my way home, but it's not great.  (sigh)  I can't even say it's serving good food or comfort food or tasty food.  It's just bland and I find myself pouring soy sauce or sweet and sour sauce on their dishes just to get some flavor.  Here's how much I wanted this place to be good: I went there for the Grand Opening and everything I ordered was bland.  Oh well, I thought, maybe they'll improve.  So I went back a second time and ordered off the specialty menu.  My stomach hurt that night from something that just wasn't properly prepared (even through it was still bland).  But I thought it might have just been a bad day for them, so I went back two more times.  Still little to no flavor in the variety of dishes that I tried.    I have a tried a few items off the specialty menu but wasn't wowed.  And their classic Chinese food fare is . . . well, lacking flavor.  The pot stickers (pan-fried dumplings) taste like frozen dinner fare.  The fried wontons tasted good, but mostly because they are deep fried (everything deep fried tastes good) and dipped in a lot of sweet and sour sauce.  The General Tso's chicken was sweet and fried, but there was nothing to it beyond the sweetness and they were advertising it as a spicy dish.  And the Mongolian Beef was just blah.    Bottom line: everything needs more seasoning, more spices, more heat, more ginger, more scallions . . . More.  More.  More.  All that said, I do want the place to stay and improve.  The folks that I've met there have always been very nice.  And when my order took a long time, they went out of their way to apologize and offered additional dishes to compensate for the delay.  I like the people, just not the food.  And I like them so much that I will proceed with blind hope and will probably stop by from time to time just to see if there's been improvement."}

FOOD:  4/5.    -The sweet and sour pork was delicious.  The only thing bad about it was the excessive amount of breading.   -If I had one last meal, their crab rangoon would be my appetizer.  It's basically a deep fried wonton with imitation crab and cream cheese inside.  It was delicious.   -Perhaps the best thing about China Tango IMO is their sweet and sour sauce.  It's mildly sweet and mildly sour, and was balanced out perfectly.  At other Chinese restaurants I tend to ask for an extra side of hot mustard to balance out their sweet and sour sauce.  SERVICE:  4/5.  -I asked the dude that worked at the counter how long it would take.  He estimated 6-7 minutes.  I think it took around 10 minutes.  Overall they were friendly.  AMBIENCE: 3/5.  -Imagine clean fast food joint.  That's pretty much it.  There is outdoor seating, not for any one particular restaurant.   Whenever I'm in the mood for Chinese food, I'll be coming back."}

We also tried their veggie egg rolls and when you sit and eat they give you their wonton chips which are quite yummy. Portions are huge, we often share a plate when we come. The food comes out very fast btw, 5-10 mins max usually.   Service is very friendly. I Highly recommend this place, especially over like Panda Express. Much more authentic and delicious.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "After seeing a bunch of reviews on my timeline and becoming intrigued by the strawberry butter on their Fried Chicken and Waffles, my boyfriend and I decided it was a sign that it was time to try this establishment after they opened up a new location close to where we live. This restaurant chain has 3 locations across the valley (and according to their website, another one opening soon on Serene and Eastern). It specializes in big portions and comfort food.  Interior: Many tables and booths available. Like the name implies, it looks exactly like any other All-American diner. The decor is very cute and reminds me of all the lunches eaten in the middle of long road trips in small towns along the way to my destination.  Service: Service was pleasant. Our waitress was very nice, knowledgeable of the menu, and very accommodating. Food came out quickly.  Food: Bold City Burger ($12.99): Consisted of Provel cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage, fried jalapeños, and garlic aioli on a brioche bun with a side of fries. My boyfriend ordered this and fell in love with it. The burger was gigantic and a lot more filling than he anticipated. He only finished half of it, and that's saying something considering he's a never-ending vacuum (still love him, though!).  Fried Chicken and Waffles ($15.99): Maybe I don't eat a lot, but this plate can easily feed two people. It comes with 3-4 giant pieces of fried chicken, a whole Belgian waffle sprinkled with powdered sugar on top, strawberry butter, and their signature sweet and spicy sauce (it's basically Louisiana hot sauce and syrup). They really meant it when the menu said it was half a chicken! The chicken was crispy and the breading was not too heavy. The sauce gives a good kick to it and you could add as much (or as little) hot sauce to your mixture as you need. Since the fluffy Belgian waffle already had powdered sugar on it, I was afraid that the strawberry butter would cause it to have a sweetness overload. Thankfully, the flavor of the strawberry butter was subtle.  I had my doubts considering this is a chain restaurant. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I will be returning here soon. This time, with an emptier stomach!"}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Stellar dining experience last night with my wife at Metro Diner! We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and promptly seated. The restaurant had a positive energy, relaxed feel, and cool retro diner vibe. All the staff, including the management, were very friendly throughout the meal. Kiki our waitress arrived at our table promptly and asked if it was our first time dining with them. We said it was, and she explained the menu to us. She gave us time to review the menu and recorded our order on a tablet computer, instead of the old-school paper and pen method. I was surprised and pleased with the large variety of menu items. The prices were good and the portions exceeded my expectations. Prior to our food arriving we noticed a piece of food on one of our forks that didn't come off in the dishwasher. We were not upset but made sure to inform our waitress, who immediately informed the manager. Not sure if he was the store owner or manager, but he promptly stopped by our table and apologized, giving us two $5 off coupons to the restaurant. The manager was very congenial and chatted with us about our families for about five minutes...very cool guy! Kiki did a great job attending to us during the meal. The food was excellent and arrived at an appropriate temperature. Payment for the meal was done via debit card on the tablet computer, allowing for TIP addition. As we left the restaurant we were thanked by at least three Metro Diner staff and one of them held the door open for us as we left. VERY impressed with this restaurant...will definitely be back!"}

Our waiter Anthony was obviously still very new and seemed a little out of it but he was ok. The food was pretty good. My girlfriend got the pot roast which was amazing. It was tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious. I got the Cajun chicken pasta which was one of their specials but it wasn't that great. It came out and the sauce looked thick and gritty which was exactly the texture I got. The flavor was ok but it was quite salty. I would certainly go back again but obviously I'm not getting the same thing."}

I've been in the Valley for a while now and just a little over a year ago I FINALLY found a Chinese food restaurant that was actually really GOOD and reminiscent of one you would find anywhere along the NE coast. I loved this place, but ended up moving to Henderson. A visit to my fav place would make me invest in a 45 min round trip to Summerlin.  We tried a few new places around GV, Eastern and so on...to see if there was anything close,  until we experienced China Tango. It is just as good as my spot in Summerlin and that's not an easy feat!  It's a small restaurant, but it looks clean and the atmosphere is pleasant. I like that you can see the kitchen, and if so inclined- you can watch them cook your food. My absolute favorite thing is that I can order for delivery from the YELP app.  Even better, every interaction I've had with either a delivery person, cashier or wait staff, has been nothing short of pleasant. Even last night, I ordered dinner and when I opened my front door, the delivery man was smiling and said Here's your dinner! I love these guys and it's small gestures like that, that totally win me over.  Great job China Tango!! Sincerely, one of your new local regulars :)"}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "American diners- images of hot waffles, cups of coffee and hearty meals come to mind. Metro Diner certainly delivered to my expectations of diner comfort food. I have seen the location on Rainbow, but I am elated they opened another location in Henderson.   I went on a Sunday morning and it was packed, but was seated in about 2 minutes by a very friendly host. The server, Leah, was very sweet and knowledgeable. There was sincerity in the customer service I can appreciate. She went over the menu noting the items highlighted in green are items unique to their diner and/or has been featured in the Fiid Network's show-Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. They also feature flavored coffee and flavor iced teas that changes daily. Also, breakfast is served all day and evening. There is plenty of staff working the kitchen and the dining area, which was great to see because it was so busy, but no one looked frazzled and patrons were checked up on frequently.  I tried the Monte Cristo and John's Senior's sandwich. The Monte Cristo was huge! Definietly a shareable plate. It came with a side of I think blackberry jam which added a bright and fruity note to the very filling battered and fried sandwich. The turkey was very moist and the ham was not too salty. Did I mention the jam? Be sure to dip the sandwich in it! It went surprisingly well together.   The John's Senior sandwich was named after the owner's father because he came up with it and was one of his favorites. It had bacon, swiss cheese, 2 sunny side eggs (cooked medium) and a slather of good ol' mayo. Served between two sliced multigrain bread. The egg yolks oozed ever so slightly and the tang of the mayo went well with the smoky bacon. For something so simple, it was done well.  Server came by with the tablet to pay. You can pay with plastic or cash. I was a little thrown off if I needed to pay a little early since I was still working on my meal, but I didn't mind since I was able to finish my meal at the end without feeling rushed.  All in all, service and food met my expectations of comfort diner food. Genuinely friendly and efficient staff. Plenty of other diner items to try in the future. Will be back for sure.

The staff was nice but a little to attentive.. they literally came by about 8 times with in 20 mins I mean I appreciate it I really do but at least give me sometime to actually try to enjoy my food, also after placing our entrees down we literally received the bill 5 mins later -guess I didn't want to try dessert. The hazelnut coffee was unfortunately not on point it was very bland and watery. I ordered the western omelette and the presentation was nice the hash browns were delicious just the right amount of soft and crunch your looking for and the (egg) omelette itself was very fluffy and delicious .. but when cutting in to the omelette a bunch of liquid poured out I assume water from the soggy onions and tomatoes, the cubes of ham inside must have trapped the moisture???

My boyfriends grandparents took us out to breakfast cuz nothing makes things better like breakfast! But nothing was more upsetting than walking in and seeing smiling faces enjoying breakfast and the world going on after 58 people had just been murdered.   I cried when an employee asked if he could get us a drink and I cried when our server asked how we were all doing. They probably had no idea why I was crying until the grandparents told them we had just had the worst night of our lives. Our server was patient, understanding, soothing, and so kind. The food was probably delicious just like it was three days before when we went for breakfast, but I couldn't tell ya for sure due to being in shock. A manager bought our meal when she got word of our situation and her kindness made me cry even more, and it even shook my boyfriend up a bit who hardly ever cries. It was so nice to be met with such genuine kindness and care after losing faith in humanity.   I can't say enough thanks to the staff that morning that brought a bit of light into the oncoming dark months.

Everything tastes super fresh and they don't use MSG, which is immediately obvious because you don't feel like crap while/after eating. They give you HUGE servings, so I recommend sharing an entree if you're not looking to take anything home.   My first visit, I ordered crab rangoon, pot stickers, wonton soup, sesame chicken, and house chow main. All of the meat is juicy and tender! We had leftovers for days and only paid about 40 bucks for all of that! Everything was delicious.   My second visit, I placed a takeout order and it was ready on time! I ordered pot stickers, hot & sour soup, house chow fun, salt & pepper shrimp, sweet & sour chicken,  and taro boba. Nothing was soggy and everything tasted great!   My only complaint would be that they don't use larger shrimp for the salt & pepper shrimp- they use the salad size and it's $11."}

He and the rest of the staff make us feel at home like we're chillin with family.   The food we've ordered has all been delicious. I've eaten pretty much everything on my plate! My husband loves the food so much he usually orders something to take home. The first time I ordered a Yo Hala with a side of turkey sausage. All I have to say is YUM! The Yo Hala was pretty sweet, but the salt from the sausage balanced it out. My dad and husband got the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter. It comes with a lot of food so if you're hungry you will be satisfied. If you're not that hungry you can either share it with a friend or take home the leftovers. My husband ordered the Holy Davoli sandwich to go. He ate that for his late night dinner.   The second time we went I ordered a chicken pot pie. I loved it because it wasn't too thick or have too much crust like some I've tried before. My dad ordered the meatloaf and husband ordered the chicken & waffles again. My husband sampled the chicken pot pie and like it so much he cleaned the bowl for me (see pictures). lol. He also liked my dad's meatloaf so he ordered a meatloaf sandwich to go. We tried the strawberry cobbler for dessert. It had a hard piece of ice cream on top which melted with the warmth from the cobbler. It was a little sweet, but it went well with the ice cream.   I'd definitely order the same things again, but I want to explore more of the menu. I think we'll be going again today. I wonder what I'll get this time..."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "China Tango is my usual I'm too lazy to cook Chinese delivery place. Where I live I'm pretty much smack dab in between two very similar establishments, so in the end it's really the value I go for.  I LOVE the delivery service from here. One reason being they don't have a minimum order amount for delivery. Their arrival is always earlier than the time they estimate for me, which is awesome when you're tired and starving. AND they also pack it up in the box, so there's no mess and it's really easy to carry a large order in. I'm always thankful for that since my dog is usually going crazy when I bring in the Goods. I just know I can depend on it, especially after a long day or discussion of What do you want to eat? I don't know, what do you want to eat?.  As for the food... My husband and I pretty much always order completely different meals, so the Individual Dinners ($9.95) are perfect for us. It lets us order our own appetizer, soup, entree and side, so we aren't obligated to compromise with ordering the family sizes of anything. The flavor is usually on point, but even when it's not, it's never something a little spice from home can't fix.  Overall: the service is quick, the food is fresh, the prices are reasonable, and after getting pretty consistent quality over 6 years, you can't ask for too much more."}

I open the door and it's heavy like it's spring loaded, we step in and sure enough the door slams behind us with a loud bang! Ooops I thought and I see the waitress cleaning the booths on the far wall, even with that loud booming door slam she didn't even acknowledge us, back turned to us and not even any eye contact or hello, I'll be with you in a moment  We take a table and still no welcome what so ever. We are both looking at her and she goes on wiping tables and not a glance our way. She is actually cleaning the rest of the booths and continues to ignore us. My wife says, lets get out of here and I thought so too, but I needed to eat before I went to work and so we stayed. I had to yell out, could we get a couple menus? and the waitress was really unwelcoming and cold. I am like, what in the world is she doing serving tables? Maybe she is working two jobs and is really burned out or someone pissed her off recently? but we are the only ones in the place.  As we looked over the menu some other people came in and she again acted like she didn't want to serve anybody. I've had better service at Carls Jr. and if they weren't a few miles away we would have went there instead. The burgers were good and a 1/2 pound double was too much for our appetites. Fries were excellent and the cook with the black cap back there is doing a great job on the food. The waitress circled our table a few times, but never spoke to us to ask how everything was luckily my wife somehow got a refill on her drink. When she circled around us, I asked for our check and she was grovelling to herself and replied back like, ILL BE RIGHT WITH YOU AS SOON AS I COME BACK  We left a few dollars tip and with that cold treatment from the waitress we over tipped in our opinion. People like that should not be serving food, we liked the food, but will never be back considering the unfriendly waitress."}

What a difference a year makes! Always enjoyed lunch here because the service was quick, the food excellent and the staff friendly. While our waiter was very nice and efficient - how can a place go downhill so fast? I was warned by my fellow employees (we have over 100) that it wasn't the same. An understatement. The 1/2 lb. burger was always large with 2 patties and a great bun. The one I received for lunch last week was much smaller and looked smushed. And the cheese!?!?!? I guess it was cheese. Ordered cheddar but what was on my burger looked liked some kind of secret sauce. (And I don't want to know what the 'secret' is). It was like an orange wet spread. My wife told me that they were using 'cheap' cheese and that's why it 'melted' like it did (more like 'liquified'). SO DISAPPOINTED! How can a place like this stay open? Is it under new ownership? Management? The food was always like homemade. Their special St Patrick's Day offering was always incredible but I can't bring myself to return again. So sad. You would think with the fabulous METRO DINER as a next door neighbor, Henry's would actually stay on their toes. Amazing."}

I can usually judge a place by 2 or 3 items, it's chicken fried steak, sausage gravy and corned beef hash.  My usual order at Henry's is the chicken fried steak but I mixed it up this morning with the hash. Glad that I did, it was amazing. Not your typical diner style hash that resembles something out of a can. This hash had substantial fresh corned beef with onions and peppers cooked perfectly on the flat top grill. Already trying to figure out when I'm going back."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I've been hearing about Henry's for quite awhile now, but always forget about it when it comes time to decide where to eat.  Recently my Mom and I were on our way to another nearby restaurant, but I realized that we were so close to Henry's that we should just stop, so we did.  And I am glad we did!  Located in a strip mall off Stephanie St., it's kind of hidden away.  Kind of a random spot for a 24 hour bar/restaurant.  First of all, only the bar side is actually open 24 hours.  The restaurant side closes at 10pm on weeknights (not sure about weekends).  After the restaurant closes, you have to be 21 to dine, since it's in the bar.  No big deal.  We entered the restaurant and were approached by the server, who told us to sit wherever we like.  We chose a booth and she gave us menus.  They have quite a selection!  From appetizers to salads, to burgers, pasta, steak, etc!  My Mom and I just about always share everything.  We decided to split the 1/2 size cobb salad, the 1/2 size mac 'n cheese and the ribeye steak.  The first thing you should know is that the portions here are pretty big.  Come hungry!  Our salad was good and came with all of the typical fixin's - hard boiled egg, bleu cheese, olives, avocado, bacon, chicken, etc.  It was larger than we expected, and pretty good.  The mac n cheese came in a large bowl, and I couldn't believe it was only the 1/2 portion.  It's supposedly made with 5 cheeses and roasted red pepper, which added a different touch.  I don't think it was a my favorite ever, but it was OK.  I would like to go back and try the habanero hamburger mac n cheese.  Sounds right up my alley!  Our ribeye was huge and cooked perfectly (medium rare).  It came with a side of snap peas and we chose jasmine rice for something different.  Everything was really tasty.  Unfortunately, the server mentioned that they are changing the menu and the ribeye will only be available for about 2 more weeks.  Then it will be replaced by a t-bone.  We were pretty stuffed, but couldn't pass up trying the brownie dessert.  Holy crap, this is a chocolate lover's heaven!  It was a LARGE brownie, topped with hot fudge, vanilla ice cream, ANOTHER LARGE BROWNIE (!!), more hot fudge and then whipped cream and cherries.  It was humongous and way more than we could eat.  Very rich as well.  I would definitely recommend this for all of you with sweet tooths!  The service was fast and friendly, although there wasn't really anyone else in the place while we were there.  The server also mentioned to us that just about everything is home made.  They don't buy anything frozen, they roast all of the meats in house, etc.  That's good to know!  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner.  I would definitely go back, and I have to return to try this graveyard special burger everyone raves about!"}

AMAZING service. Nothing fancy. It was pretty empty but that actually enhanced the experience for us. Our waitress was AWESOME and pretty much had the entire place to herself which allowed her to spend a little more time with each table. There are times when you go to a restaurant and you feel rushed because they're so busy. Not here. She gave us time and was available to answer any questions we had.   I had the Savannah burger and OH MY GOD was it delicious. Cooked to perfection. My wife had a burger as well and enjoyed as well as my mother in law who had a salad and was highly impressed. We split the brownie sundae for dessert and left excited and FULL.   This place is great if you just want some delicious food and SPACE to enjoy it.

The restaurant is on the left side, and there is a door to the bar on the right. Smoking is allowed in the bar, and there is gaming there as well.  It's on the small side but nice and quiet.

Bourbon bread pudding with a scoop of Thrifty ice cream!  YAY!  I ordered the BLT, and my friend had the club sandwich. We both had seasoned waffle fries.  The sandwich was perfect! His was huge!  He ate half and took the rest home for lunch! Not to mention the bar special is $1.50 bottles of Bud light Platinum for the rest of August! Killer deal!

I wish him the best luck because that is a horrible way to run your business.

I encounter and speak to many people and will encourage to go somewhere else. Village pub is where I will be.  Better promotions for gamers.  I only went there because of her as did her following.

I rate this 3 stars because of the lack of sanitation we witnessed when dining in. They hired this older waitress who must've never been in the food industry before or was just plain careless.   She was serving a large group of people and when she brought their food out she placed her entire hand on top of this girl's hamburger instead of holding both of her hands on the side/under the plate like you're supposed to do. Seconds later she checks on another table and they ask for extra napkins and she wiped her hand on it and gave it to the customer.

Before we walked in there was a chalkboard listed with the daily specials: split pea soup and chicken stroganoff. Instantly, I felt like I was going to have dinner at some American's household. We walked in around 2pm and the restaurant section was completely empty. The bar section had a few of customers inside video gaming and drinking. (The bar and restaurant is sectioned off by a door. As soon as you enter, you are in the restaurant and you just need to open the door on the right to get to the bar.)  Pros:  We ordered fish & chips and club sandwich. The fish & chips came with cole slaw and for the club sandwich we got a side of pasta salad. The portions were huge; I'd say 4 people could have shared this meal. We liked the quality of the fish & chips because they used actual filets (and not mystery fish meat) and we liked the coat of crispy batter. The fries were decent, nothing remarkable. The club sandwich was a hit! They packed it in with real turkey meat (not turkey ham) and layers and layers of ham. All in all, it was a solid American lunch.   Kimberly was our waitress and she was really friendly and was great at her job. We ordered a diet coke and she brought a pitcher of it so we don't have to keep asking for refills. How convenient!  Open 24hrs!  Cons:  The decor is not welcoming or comforting at all. No real sunlight gets into the restaurant (windows are tinted), the booths are designed with tacky patterns, there are wine bottles held on these wirey frames (uhm...is it a wine tree?) and there are reminiscent 1920's-1930's bar pictures. And due to the adjacent bar, some of the cigarette smoke leaks into the restaurant. In my opinion, it'd be better to visit Henry's at night after a couple drinks.   BTW: It cost $0.40 extra to get a side of ranch! I don't mind the cost, but seriously?   Current promotions: Monday Pro-football Specials (3-10PM): $1 hot dogs, $1 coors light drafts Saturday & Sunday (9AM-6PM): $5 off any large pizza, $5 coors light pitchers (in house special only)  Photos:  I posted photos of the menu."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Two words: Graveyard Specials OMG these are terrific - a great bargain for great quantity and quality food.  I first came here way back in July when I had just moved out here. My friends were coming to visit, and they had been stuck in traffic for a long time...resulting in them arriving hours past when they were supposed to. Yelp for late night food brought me to this gem. The first time I went, my friends and I, looked at the prices of their graveyard specials and assumed it would be small portions. We couldn't have been more wrong. The portions were very generous! Especially considering the price. I think we accidentally ordered enough to feed an elephant...if an elephant ate cheeseburgers, nachos, pizza, and the like.  I've gone back a couple times since...and every time the food is consistently delicious and a steal. My favorites are the pulled pork sandwich and garlic parmesan chicken tenders. Their pizza is pretty good too. The pulled pork sandwich has just enough kick to it make it something special. The flavor in the garlic parmesan chicken fingers is delicious - I like that they use from what I can tell, shredded parmesan and fresh garlic - not just like powdered parmesan. The teriyaki ones are pretty good as well. Quality and quantity of pizza and toppings is also really good as well as the size of the pizza itself.  The pulled pork sandwich is this big monster...there is a fork in the napkin roll...use it...it will be your friend. The tenders are only $1 each (though they're sold in pairs). These tenders aren't your McDonalds mighty kids fingers...no sir...each one is like the size of my hand. There are 11 preparations you can choose from too to suit your fancy.  In terms of service...it's as fast as it can be given the circumstances. When I go late at night, there's only one person there running the place both bringing orders and working the bar...I think his name is Tom. My guess is there's very few people in the kitchen, maybe even only one. When it's busy, service can be a bit slow (i.e. friday, saturday night). - so I guess this is kind of a quasi complaint. But since there's only one person there running himself ragged, I'm not taking off points. He's also really friendly no matter how busy it is, which I really appreciate.  My one complaint is that the bar area is pretty smoky. Ventilation isn't great. But it's tolerable.   One of these days, I do need to come back to try food on the regular menu, but when I come here late at night, it seems like too much of a shame to not take full advantage of the graveyard specials.  Thank goodness for this place to satisfy my late night munchies. i do stay up late much more than I should...and I'm really glad i found this gem. The value for food from the graveyard menu really can't be beat."}

Took one bite and inspected the sliced breast - not thoroughly cooked. Waitress is nowhere; after about 10 minutes I took it to the cook myself. He argued that it was indeed cooked; further cooking would burn it. I asked him to return it to the grill anyway. He used his HANDS to pluck slices off the top, then grilled them. After a few moments of sizzling (which seemed promising) he used a spatula to return the slices to my salad while I stood at the service counter. I brought the plate back and bit into a piece of chicken that still had that unmistakable raw texture. Waitress still nowhere. I couldn't even nibble the sad heap of cabbage. Finished my wine, which was supposed to be Pinot Grigio; not sure what sort of wine it actually was; color and flavor more like Chardonnay. Left hungry.

They just were not the same, they used to be covered in garlic and Parmesan.  The BLT was good but again something from the taste was missing.  It seemed like the bacon was not only over cooked but it almost seemed like they are using a different kind then they used to.  This was a great place for comfort food now it is just an ok place.  They do not have wifi still so that makes it inconvenient as a place to hang or meet with people if you need Internet access.  All in all, this visit was less then spectacular.

So who can say no to a place that has waffle cut fries on the menu? In we went. On a side note my gps told me it was on the wrong side of the road, so if you are starting and not seeing it anywhere..It's on the west side of the street.  Anyway. We were promptly greeted by a server who was very friendly. The menu is huge, which I love and hate. I was the kid that was so torn between choosing between candy choices as a kid that my mom would actually have to do a countdown for me and it ALWAYS was a last minute selection.... and I still.have that problem. Anyway. I got the... crap.. It's the brisket sandwich on focaccia with roasted peppers, sports, gouda, horseradish.. Ugh my memory. My husband got the German burger and even though.we did not need it, we got  order of the habenero hamburger Mac and cheese.. when in Rome.   Food was prompt. I live that we got mini pitchers of our drinks. So much easier. Those were refilled And I never faced an empty glass while needing to cool down my fiery habenero mouth.  My sandwich was delicious. A great flavor combo and I was thankful for having unique menu options too choose from. I hate having to choose between a cheeseburger, chicken fingers, and a club. Boring. The only complaint I had was by the time I.Got to the end it was a little soft and started to fall apart on hand.  The Mac was delightful. Definitely NOT shy on the habeneros. Definite heat. We.live on spicy food (like I go.through more cayenne than any spice in my.cabinet..salt included)   Hubbys burger was oddly good too. I really.worried because it arrived in all of its messy topping glory, which I.knew my husband would have no patience for one it started to.squish out the sides and fall apart. Shockingly, it didn't. Amazing! I'm not  kraut fan at all but.I.sampled a bite.and the flavors all worked together.   The prices are decent. You.get plenty of food and it is very good.

My only main question is this- how the hell did I not know about a 24/7 spot, that's close to my house, that me and my bf can eat salads and appetizers and entrees for $34?!!??! All together we ordered: 2 sodas, a nachos app, a gravy fries app, a 1/2 size house salad, 1/2 size POTW (pasta of the week), and a nacho burger.  Originally we ordered the gravy fries along side the burger, but she brought out a whole order. We weren't complaining, especially when it wasn't any extra on our tab! The house salad was good. Fresh with yummy dressing. The nachos were bomb. I love good nachos and these had chili and cheese with sour cream and green onions then a side of jalapeños and salsa that went great with it. The POTW was chicken curry with mushrooms and onions. This was the only thing I wouldn't order again. Not that it was bad, the chicken was cooked right and the veggies were good. It was just bland. It lacked the flavor you expect from anything with curry in the title. My bf devoured his nacho burger, it had cheese oozing out the side that went on his fries. (Who doesn't like cheesy fries) so yes he has cheesy fries and gravy fries, don't judge.  My only negative observation was they seemed understaffed. I watched all of my food sit in the window for 1-3 minutes before being served to me. All the while there was a second waitress who looked like she wanted nothing to do with the other one, nor her tables as she wouldn't even make eye contact with us. Our waitress, (Kimberly was the name on the ticket) was still great and even apologized for being so rushed.  Overall I had a good experience and can't wait to return to try the mushroom blue cheese burger. And probably many other things as well.  Thanks Shirley B. and Vegas J.

If a customer wants a Turkey dip and wants to substitute turkey for roast beef there shouldn't charge a fee to switch the two meats.

The soda was flat, but she was nice enough to bring us each our own mini-pitcher. I ordered the ribeye (med-rare) and a Caesar salad. The salad was absolutely drowning in dressing and soggy.  Well over an hour after we sat down we finally had our entrees. The steak was good. Not exceptional, but more than I had expected. Some parts of it were over-charred/dry and it really detracted from the natural flavor of the meat. It was a very fatty/sinewy cut, and I felt mislead by the quality promised on the menu. They served it with peas that didn't seem to be seasoned at all and could have come right out of your grocer's freezer.  The fries and barbecue sauce were a bright spot.

Asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested the Hank or a Burger. Went for the Hank, and a Nut brown beer. Food and drink came quick.  Large prime rib with lots of crunchy fries. Beer was good and nice and cold, not flat or warm.  Generous amount of peppers and onions on the sandwich.  Was hot fresh and tasty. Prime rib was cut nice with little fat but still juicy and tender.  Only criticism would be that the bread got a little soggy.  Ended up eating second half with fork and left bread.  I would recommend Henry's to anyone that is looking for good food at a good price. Was not blown away, but was happy overall. I would come back."}

Separated by a glass door.   The food  We'll start here, 'cause that's what's important. we ordered the fried clams (pretty good), the world's best macaroni......not so much. I'm pretty sure it had turned bad already. Everything else was barely mediocre.   Service  Our waitress was a very nice lady, but unfortunately the worst waitress.....ever. she took forever to do anything. She was around, just didn't react to things you'd expect. Missing silverware and napkins. You basically were better off getting things from the kitchen yourself.   Location  Outside looks good. Inside, the smoke smell was like the old Klondike casino. I am a hardcore smoker, and don't mind indoor smoke smell when I'm drinking or with buddies, but I want my kids to choose whether they want to smoke or not. It definitely should not be advertised as a family establishment."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I can't believe I didn't stop at Henry's earlier.  It's in the same strip mall as the place we mail packages, so I've driven by it several times.  Today, we finally had lunch here.  The dining room is bigger than you would expect given its location, with room between most of the tables.  They had some pushed together, but it was not close to being crowded, so it didn't matter.  We were waited on immediately (service was excellent throughout the meal), and as a few yelpers note, they leave a pitcher of your selected beverage (for us, Dr. Pepper and water) at your table.  Also, I request a lot of ice in my fountain drinks.  The server brought me a whole glass of ice in addition to the pitchers.  The glasses at Henry's are large, so the pitcher was about a refill, maybe a little more.  But, I feel like this touch demonstrates a little care for the customer.  Also, we all know how frustrating it can be to eat, finish your drink, and you can't get the server's attention for a refill while you are still eating.  I wish more restaurants would adopt Henry's practice.  They probably lose a little bit of soda or tea when pitchers aren't finished, but that's maybe 2 cents worth of liquid, well worth it to provide better service in my estimation.  We had chips and salsa to start.  The salsa was good consistency, not runny like some chains, but also not totally chunky like pico de gallo.  The chips needed some salt and weren't warm, but that's not a huge issue.  To eat, the wife had the shrimp dinner.  This is a fantastic deal, 7 large fried shrimp, a huge order of fries and a portion of cole slaw for $10.  The shrimp was not overly done, which can happen when it's fried.  Excellent consistency.  The fries are of a thickness between thin fries (think McDonald's) and steak fries.  The breading was crunchy.  Very very good fries.  I will say the ranch appeared to be from a bottle.  I couldn't say for sure, but it was probably the least impressive part of the meal.  I had the bourbon BBQ burger with waffle fries.  This was a very juicy burger.  It's a large burger consisting of 2 patties on an onion bun.  I could have used more fried onions.  They are smaller, not the longer shoestring type onions.  So, they often fell out.  It was tough to get a complete bite of all the ingredients together.  The bacon was very VERY crispy.  I'm okay with it this done, but a lot of people aren't.  I had to finish the burger with my fork it was so messy.  But, it was fantastic.  And, it was only $9.  I didn't even finish the waffle fries, there were that many on the plate.  These were large and very well seasoned.    Although we didn't go into the bar, it looked comfortable.  A large bar with a couch area that had a couple of chairs.  Looked to be very cozy, and had a few people in around 1 pm on Sunday.  We will definitely return, and like I said, I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Large, varied menu, breakfast all day on Sundays.  We started with gravy fries, something every diner in NJ had growing up.  I have to say, these are some of the best gravy fries in Las Vegas.  Crisp, startchy fries covered in a gooey gravy that reminds me of... well, hometown diners.  For our main course, my daughter had buttered pasta which was shells.  It could have used a little more flavor but she enjoyed it.  The two large pieces of garlic bread was too much for a kids meal and one half piece would have been sufficient. (This is not a negative, but more of a suggestion that would both save money and keep the kids from eating too many carbs.)  I went with the fried clams.  The clams themselves were real clams, chewy and stretchy.  They would have been great but the coating was overcooked and to heavily coated so it was difficult to get the clam flavor without peeling off the coating. Next time I will try one of their specials like country fried steak.   For desert we split a fudge sundae.  The staff was happy to take the peanuts off for us even though the menu stated they were on there and we just didn't pay attention.    Service was excellent. Our server was very attentive, very honest about the menu options and made sure we had everything we needed several times.  I enjoyed that they bring a whole pitcher of tea or lemonade to your table so you don't have to find them for a refill.  Henry's is a great addition to the Henderson cuisine.  I am hopeful my next trip will raise the rating a star."}

Plus, super reasonably priced considering how much food you get.  So right off I ordered a Bloody Mary. Be prepared to wait. The waitress rocks, it's just there is only one of her, but it's worth the wait to me. My drink was super strong and tangy! Just how I like it. It also came with a lemon and olive for garnish. As for their other drinks like soda, tea or water they serve it to you in a little pitcher so you can refill it yourself. I love that!  Some of my favorite items to order include the Gravy Fries. They have a brown or white gravy. I really love the brown. Coupled with the super crisp fries the gravy is a perfect salty/savory kick. I have gotten their Club Sandwich which is huge!! I always get it with rye bread. (They don't list it as a side option, but if you ask you can order a side salad instead of their other choices.) The Pesto Chicken sandwich on focaccia is full of flavor and the chicken was moist and not over cooked. Also, I really enjoy their regular house salad. Joel loves their Baked Ziti. If you love pasta this place has a weekly pasta special. They also serve breakfast ALL day on Sundays.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back. You can choose to sit in the restaurant part or the bar area. You can get the specials no matter where you sit.   This place is a winner for me. Great food and tasty drinks. They need maybe one more waitress on busy days. The one they have is super friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back to try something else off their tasty menu!"}

My son had a burger that was huge and I am a club sandwich fan so went that route.  I am a big guy but could not get my mouth over a quartered hunk of that sandwich.

The low light, decor, and bar area reminded me of a bar in Washington where I went to college.  Our waitress, Shelly, was very good and she had a good sense of humor (I love banter with a waitress).  My wife's 7-up came with a half pitcher refill that was set on the table.  The half pound cheeseburger was a steal at $4.99!  It was big, delicious, and very filling.  They have specialty burgers for $8.99 that all looked pretty great and come with a side.  The cheaper burger doesn't come with a side but fries are only $2.50.  The onion rings and fries were great.  My wife had the Reuben and, while it was very tasty, the meat could have been sliced a bit thinner.  Beers were cheap at $3.75 for domestic but I think this place really needs to have a happy hour.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "The story will take a while, so bear with me. Or just scroll to the bottom.  After a nice long afternoon and evening slumber and a few TV episodes, I was pretty famished. It was well past midnight, and I had just the place in mind: Henry's.  Upon entering the anteroom, I saw the sign to hit the doorbell if the inner door was locked, so I did that and smiled for the camera (look up and to the right). The door clicked and I walked in. I saw the restaurant to the left and a bar to the right, where seemingly everybody was. Since I didn't feel like eating my food through the stench of cigarette smoke, I sat on the restaurant side.  The late night menu was exciting to see. Available from midnight until 7am, it offers a decent array of options including a couple breakfast options, some nachos, salads, and soup. I was destined to get the burger, however, and opted for the $1.99 hamburger. Couldn't justify adding $1 for a $2.99 cheeseburger, even if it would have been that much yummier. Also got the crunchy fries for $1 and added an appetizer of two garlic parm chicken fingers, learning later that it's actually $1.00 for each finger even though the menu says to order by twos.  I was still a little hazy with the passage of time and such, but it probably took 10-15 minutes. For all I cared, it could've taken half an hour and I wouldn't have been too concerned, given a prior experience at a late night place. It just so happened that one moment I was looking at my phone, and the next I saw three red plastic trays on the counter at the kitchen. The cook soon asked me if those were my items, given that the only other guy was still in the bar. I indicated as such and he brought the trays out to me.  FOOD! Oh yes, I had waited for this, and I was ready to enjoy it. I grabbed a chicken finger first, and I noticed it was still hot, and oh so greasy. A little too greasy. I later saw a huge pool of oil at the bottom of the paper and got just a little freaked out. I think the fingers were a little overdone, but they were still pretty good. The complementary ranch definitely helped out. Grease aside, there's so much meat here for $1 that you'd be doing yourself a disservice going anywhere else during these hours.  The burger was a treat. There's lettuce, grilled onions, tomato, slightly too many pickle slices, and a special sauce that I couldn't tell you much about except that it was delicious. The burger was well done, but you can't win every single time I guess. I just have no idea how you're going to beat this value for $1.99.  The fries were also ridiculously good. They're cut pretty thick, floured a bit, and reportedly brined before frying, and they were just super fluffy and maintained that outer crunch throughout the night. And they sure lasted that long since the order is so dang huge! You can easily share this between 2 or even 3 people, but I braved the pile as a loner. They actually held up flavor-wise too until the last handful, where I finally asked the cook for the ketchup. Probably should've asked for the ketchup even earlier, but I was too stubborn.  I've only eaten out a few times after midnight, but it still shouldn't have taken years for me to visit this place. Henry's was one of those places that I'd heard about for a little while but hadn't bothered to visit. Now, it's one of those places that I'd love to visit again and again if I'm ever awake at the proper time."}

I had heard some good words about Henry's from a guy at work so I figured I'd track it down.   I'm my opinion it's a bit hard to spot because it's located in a shopping plaza and the only signage is on the doors (at least what I could see). You have to know what you're looking for to spot it.  One side is a bar (with machines) which is closed off from the restaurant side.   I did my eating in the restaurant.   Very spacious and clean with four tvs to keep you busy.   The staff (Kimmy) was very pleasant and very helpful with the menu.  Additionally,  I ordered iced tea and not only did she bring me a full glass, she brought a mini pitcher full as well  The pizza,  bbq, and burgers get good reviews so I decided to go burger today.   The Farm Burger to be exact.   Sweet 6lb Baby Jesus, how big should a burger be?!  Two beef patties, fried egg, bacon, plus the normal veggies with  a side of slaw.   Very  very tasty!!

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "First off the outside of this place and the decor could scare anybody away. There is just something about the colors and decor or maybe even the word fonts themselves that make me almost shriek. I've driven by the place a million times over the past 8 years and never went in. Thought I'd give it a try after reading reviews here.  First time we went we got pot roast and a bleu cheese burger. Consider yourself warned, this burger is HUGE, and I think it's real meat not cheaper filler. This was made with two heavy patties and a bleu cheese sauce and waffle fries were good too. The pot roast comes with potatoes, carrots and a fresh roll. It was so tender you could cut it with a fork. Went a few more times and tried soups and pastas. The pasta was exotic and different.  The clam chowder was excellent. The turkey soup was good but slightly cold, all I had to do was send it back and I didn't bother asking.  The waitresses are nice and attentive.  If you ask for coffee you get a carafe, if you ask for water you get a pitcher.   We enjoyed lunch items, haven't tried pizza yet. We didn't dig the onion rings too much they too thick and the breading fell off making them kinda pointless.  We tried the breakfast and it was OK. I think we ordered wrong for what we wanted, we got omelette's and the toast was cold and hard ( in their defense we are having a cold spell here and it was cold in there in general so hot toast wasn't gonna happen despite any efforts), The eggs were OK, nothing special, same with the hash browns. Then after we ate the waitress showed us the eggs and pancakes order someone else got and we were covetous... OK.. next time!! That plate looked to be more up our alley and a better deal. There are a few affordable breakfast items but some are over priced. If they served a cheap breakfast 24 hours I'd bet their clientele would beef up.  We haven't done much dinner here or pasta, never tried that. Overall its very good American food, most items are a decent or big portion. The prices are kinda all over the place but you get options too like with the pasta special you can order a 1/2 portion for 1/2 price or you can get a single burger for less.   I think like anywhere else you just have to know what to order. If I could go up to 3 1/2 stars in the rating I would."}

We walked in and seated ourselves (hoping that was proper etiquette) in some rather spacious, long booths. The one front of house staff person delivered some tables' food, then brought us menus.  Perusing their offerings, I decided to give their World's Best Mac & Cheese a try. Since I wanted more than just cheesy pasta, I added the chicken option.  With our glasses of water, the server also brought out a small pitcher of water for us, which was nice to have handy!  Let's put it this way, one pound of mac and cheese, with a chicken breast makes for a HUGE plate of food to see appear before one's self. My wife and I both took exploratory bites of the pound of cheesy mac. It was....  ...  Barely mediocre.   The cheese was not very flavorful, there was an abundance of melted, yellow cheese throughout.   The chicken was... well, it started out as chicken. It was grilled on an open flame, so the outside was charred pretty good and the inside was half dry and tough, half almost moist. There was no flavor beyond charcoal.  $16 for a pound of mediocre mac and cheese, with a burnt chicken breast? I think this place will not be getting my business again for a while.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I frequent Henry's when I know I'm hungry enough to eat a GINORMOUS portion.  Touted as an American grill, they certainly have a lot to choose from. Pizzas, burgers and sandwiches are among the many, many menu choices. I had the Honey Fried Chicken salad with sliced apples and toasted almonds on my last visit. I know this isn't a NEW concept for a dinner salad, but I did enjoy that the breading on the chicken had a sweet honey flavor. It really went well with the honey mustard dressing.  All fountain drinks that you order always end up coming with a small pitcher on the side that will probably fill your drink two more times. Some would call this a lazy practice so the wait staff doesn't have to refill drinks, I think of it as a thoughtful touch.  They also have an extensive breakfast menu. I've only had the corned beef hash, which was delicious and plentiful.   They have a sports bar feel going on, as there are a few TV's situated around with sports playing. I wouldn't say it isn't kid friendly at all.  Bottom line, reasonable prices, HUGE portions, great variety and good staff. I'd recommend Henry's for a causal meal with friends."}

If you are in the area around the Galleria Mall or DMV, this is a nice meal stop. The club and Hank sandwiches are solid, and you will need a to-go box.

The salad was a little disappointing but like the head chef said last night, good lettuce even the organic kind is hard to come by right now.  We have noticed at the farmers markets that the same is true.  Other then that, the drinks are cheap and amazing, best bartendar's in town.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Ok. So I was really torn. I wanted to give this place a  better review, but in good conscience I can't recommend this place. I'll get to that, but a few good things to point out first.  The pulled pork sandwich was good, but they didn't toast the bun. So the sauce and the juice from the pork just turned it into inedible mush. But! Some pork on the fries with some cheese and jalapeños would have been awesome. Or just toast the bun.   My wife liked her turkey sandwich dinner thing. Hot turkey sandwich or something. Normally served open face, but here they don't do that.   Here's where the 1 star comes from: Ordered chicken wings. They were ICE cold in the middle. Hot on the outside, FREEZING on the inside. She offered to have them remade which I was fine with, but the second batch came out rubbery. So this tells me they aren't properly cooking and/or thawing the chicken. It's gonna get someone sick and even though I liked the pulled pork and the fries and my wife liked her turkey I can't suggest to you to go here if they can't cook wings safely.   Our waitress was wonderful, the bar area was nice ( a little Smokey but not too bad. Didn't bother my wife with asthma). They had TV's but smaller ones so it was ok for watching a game but not ideal.   Had the wings not been getting people sick would have gone 3 maybe 4 stars. But I doubt those bad food handling habits are isolated to just their wings."}

GF ordered a veggie omelet ( after the list of veggies ordered along with egg white - cost $11.50) - it was a sorry looking omelet - small, browned to imperfection and the veggies were greasy ( she asked for no oil )   I went with the pot roast hash ( i believe it cost $10.95 ) - although a little on the greasy side, the hash was pretty tasty.

Lots of large booths and tables available to accommodate large and small parities alike.

She also explained that everything is made from scratch, so I was already excited about our meal.  My friend ordered the Savannah burger with waffle fries and I ordered the fried shrimp with crispy fries and cole slaw. The food came out and it was delicious. My friend's burger was enormous and despite his hearty appetite was only able to finish half before throwing in the towel. My shrimp was tasty and fresh.

The $19 burgers in the casinos are starting to take a toll on me, literally, so coming across the $4.99(!) burger at Henry's American Grill in Henderson was exciting and promised big things based on all the Yelp comments. And although I had a couple complaints as I always do, this turned out to be a good visit.  Henry's is located deep in Henderson in a typical strip of retail, and seems like every other bar from the outside. And honestly it's not very fancy or different on the inside either, but this is what to expect of a local pub, you're not really going for the ambiance. I went at lunchtime but the restaurant side was completely empty and didn't even look open so I ventured to the stinky bar side. I sat down at one of the high tops away from the bar, but I wish someone could have told me the restaurant side was indeed open because I was the only person out of a handful not smoking. There were a few regulars drinking at the bar around noon, and it seemed like a friendly local spot.  The menu has typical pub faire; pizza, burgers, salad, supposedly a decent breakfast...but I was there for the burgers that many locals have claimed to be the best in town. They offer a handful of 'specialty burgers' including a Bourbon BBQ, Mushroom Bleu Cheese, Southwestern, Nacho and a couple others, but the stars of the menu are the $3.99 Hamburger and $4.99 Cheeseburger, both with' the works.' They even tout this on their menu as an awesome burger at an awesome price. For sides you have some interesting choices: freedom fries, coleslaw, pasta salad, jasmine rice or fresh fruit. I've heard some great things about the bleu cheese cream sauce, but I had to see if the $4.99 awesome burger really was as claimed.  The verdict? For $4.99 it's pretty damn good. The meat has really great char flavor, and just good meat flavor overall. My medium-rare burger came out as ordered, and my cheese was melted. The bun was good, it got a tiny bit soggy from the juiciness of the burger but held together. The special sauce really wasn't too noticeable until one of my bites near the end, almost a red relish kind of sauce that tasted pretty good and made me wish it was a little more present sooner. This wasn't an overly fancy burger that you'd find at Burger Bar or Bachi, but it was really good.  And of course I'm never completely happy, as the fries were really not good. I'm getting really tired of the fries being the one aspect that brings down my meal; they're such an important yet neglected part of a burger meal. They looked like they could be good, but just didn't have any great flavor to them and were a bit soggy for my taste. I have no doubt that I would give this overall meal a much higher score if I were happier about the fries. At $4.99 this is a really great deal, combined with some amazing fries and it could become a really special gem off the strip for burger lovers. It's still definitely worth the price as maybe the fries are sometimes inconsistent? Either way, check it out based on the price alone."}

I got the Henry with sweet potato puffs, and I'll give the sandwich a 3.5, was a little tough for prime rib, would have been as expected for a steak sand.  The puff were ok but needed something to dip in or something. But all in all a good casual place to eat."}

He sucks at managing a bar and does not want to serve alcohol. I believe he enjoys Serving food to regulars more than make shots or pour liquor. It turns out we were paying 4.75 for a pint of beer even while gambling. Somehow I get a feeling he likes to hook up only his regulars. Won't be headed back anytime soon. This is kind of sad too because it's so close to home. If you are a beer drinker and like to get good service from a bartender skip this place because it's just not going to happen.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Judging by the name and font on the storefront, I would never have known this was a mom n' pop kind of place. Once you seat yourself inside and look around, you'll continue to wonder where am I. The décor is not exactly consistent...it is a dinner, in a strip mall, with Tuscany-wine themed décor, and bathrooms that have industrial metal doors...hmmm...good thing I wasn't eating décor or we would have had a problem.  I instead noshed on the decadent sweet potato puffs (deep fried perfectly) and the gilled prime rib sandwich with my guest - who, btw, loved the sandwich. I was not a fan because I couldn't get past the undertones of ancho seasoning - which haunted me until I dissected my sandwich to thoroughly figure out what I tasted. Beyond the misfit of seasoning, the sandwich was fine and paired well with the (properly seasoned) pasta salad. Onion rings were on par...but, again, I need to stress how delicious the sweet potato puffs are and cutely served in a lil' metal basket!!  The menu is several pages of comfort food, the booths are big and could fit 6 people, they offer 24/hr. service, and beverages in big glasses...our server even placed a carafe of iced tea at our table which was a nice touch. Service was prompt and enthusiastic. Very clean place with an open kitchen area that was spotless!  I will return soon; can't wait to stroll in here with the hubs on a lazy Saturday when he is craving gravy fries or a hot turkey sandwich! Henry's will be the perfect fit!"}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "DRIVE TIME / WAIT: After reading many rave reviews over this place I decided to give it a shot. We live in the GVR/Anthem area and it was a short drive from our house. Less than 15 mins. For the first visit, I wanted to get take-out. I actually TIMED them with a stop watch app on my phone. They had my order ready within 8 minutes! :)  SETTING/THEME: First off, I've seen many people complain about the darkness of the place. Well, as it turns out I think it looks GREAT and I love low lighted settings (think Outback SteakHouse or Red Lobster). Bright, sunlit places actually annoy me because I'm squinting my eyes the whole time. They have the restaurant and gaming/bar sections separated by solid walls and a dark tinted black door, which I felt was a nice touch and clever. The restaurant section was one really big room with good distance between tables so no one would EVER feel crowded. All the furnishings were made of soft, light colored, polished wood with plenty of padded booths and tables for 4 available.  CROWD: Personally, I wish more young people would explore their food options. There are so many wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas and it seems the only people who know about these wonderful places are senior citizens and foodies like me. This place has a staff of waitresses in their 40s+. There were 3 senior citizen couples there as customers eating in. They all must've been at least 50+.  WHAT I ORDERED: 2 double cheeseburgers with bleu cheese and the works + 1 order of fries.  COST: $17.60 total. They were a tad bit expensive. If they would drop all their prices just $1, they would OWN this valley!   FOOD: The burgers were clearly hand crafted and well seasoned 100% real beef. The patties were huge. I would compare them to Five Guys Burgers and Fries, both the burgers and the fries. However, Henry's American Grill's patties are slightly bigger than Five Guys'. the burgers were delicious.   The fries were home cooked style regular sized seasoned fries. I prefer light crispy shoestring fries myself so the fries here seemed sub-par to me.  The one thing I found disappointing was that I ordered blue cheese and they only gave me a small dab of bleu cheese. I would've expected 3-4 dabs for that price. If I had ordered American, Swiss, or any other cheese, you would have given me a full slice. So, why is it when I order Bleu Cheese, you give me 1/4 of the amount of cheese I would normally get?  CHANCE OF RETURN: Definitely! They have some great stuff on their menu I'd like to try. Like the whiskey glazed bread pudding,. and pulled pork sandwiches.  I'm @MakellBird on twitter. Follow me!"}

I was recovering from a fractured pelvic bone, so sitting in one spot is painful. My 3rd guest was my friends husband. We had to wait over 30 minutes for a hamburger, a reuben and an omelette. Our waitress asked the cooks 2 times for our order. I watched her get berated for her efforts. Later. I complained to Dina, the bartender, an  asst. Manager? And she pretended to listen.

It's an interesting set up with an enclosed bar on one side and the restaurant on the other. There are booths and the sides and sort of communal tables in the middle.   We were seated quickly and had our drink orders taken right away. I ordered The Hank which is a prime rib sandwich with grilled peppers and onions. Once the food arrived the service ended. The sandwich was very salty and the prime rib had a good amount of fat in it (even for prime rib). I kept biting in to large pieces of fat.   The sweet potato tots (or puffs as they call them) were okay, nothing great. The waitress never returned. We had to flag her down for a to go box, again for the check, and again to take the check. I would categorize Henry's as bar food and not much more. Its great that its open 24 hours so if your looking for a late night snack this might do the trick. For dinner though I would look elsewhere."}

You mean I don't have to wait for my refill or flag down the waitress? Love it.  The menu is very extensive.  There is such a variety of meals to choose from including breakfast items.   From pizza to pot roast to a burger... they've got you covered.    A nachos appetizer?  That has Bethany written all over it!  With toppings of cheese, tomatoes, jalapeños and chili, it was surely a winner.  It seemed like no time passed before our nachos were sitting in front of us.  They had a great flavor with salsa and sour cream served on the side.  I'd definitely get these again.  For our entree we split the Pesto Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  It was great!  The warm rosemary focaccia bread enclosed the juicy grilled chicken breast. The melted cheese and roasted red peppers gave it an extraordinary flavor. My husband did like the rosemary flavor... but not loved it like I did.  We all have different tastes.  Crispy french fries were served on the side ~ a great compliment to the sandwich.   I saw they offered sweet potato puffs on the side...  Sure!  Why not?! They were good but not great.  A little too soggy in the middle.  I would suggest sticking with the fries.   Phenomenal service from Lori! She was an absolute delight!  It just makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable.

Located in a shopping mall area off Stephanie, you walk in and get the choice of dining in a clean, bright dining area, or heading into the bar area which is a bit darker and smokier. Its a nice menu of comfort foods. Plenty of selection.  Now to the little things that make it a nice meal. Pleasant service and frequent check backs. Ice tea in a glass, and in a 32 oz pitcher for refills. Butter that isn't frozen but soft and easily spreadable. A steak knife that wasn't necessary because the chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly and you could cut with a fork. Portion sizes that are plenty.

There's bleu cheese mixed with happiness to create an amazing cream sauce concoction that makes my heart ache with every bite. If only I could make a bleu cheese sauce that delicious. They also have a Farm Burger and Nacho Burger that put my boyfriend down for the happy food coma coma. Good quality ingredients in a solid bun that somehow keeps up with all the messiness.  Their Garlic and Rosemary Chicken is fantastic. Tender, never overcooked, savory and filling in every way possible. The mashed potatoes on the side are mediocre, but who needs potatoes when there's a scrumptious chicken to devour?  Henry's is a 24 hour restaurant, and they have a GREAT late night menu. Everything is $5 and the best bang for your buck. The late night cheeseburger is equally delicious after 12AM. They have the standards, 2 eggs, hash browns and toast, but the star of this menu is the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. The smells of this sandwich followed me to the restaurant when it was in front of my boyfriend in the bar section. Great sauce, tender pork, great seasoning. It comes with plenty of fries that are crispy, well seasoned and not disappointing in any way.  To top it all off, they have mini-desserts, including a hot fudge sundae that proves sometimes you need a little sweetness at the end of every meal.  Definitely stop by here for a quick bite. Even though not everything on the menu is as good as the next, overall this restaurant has great quality for a perfect price. Top it off with consistently fantastic service and you've got a deal."}

Food: 4  Blackened Chicken Quesadilla: This quesadilla comes loaded with chicken and fried to a crisp on the outside. The salsa isn't spicy, but it adds a nice touch of acidity and heat. The guacamole was decent, but I definitely wished I got a bigger portion when I paid $1.50 for it.  Service: 4.5  As far as I could tell, there was a lone waiter manning the restaurant during lunch time. It's not super busy, so that's alright. However, it does become hard for him to manage if there are more than a couple tables, and it took awhile for us to get our checks.  That said, he was awesome in making separate checks for each person even though the restaurant's policy clearly stated that group of 12+ people could not get separate checks.

The only bartender that ever kicked adam out was MARY.. she stond  up for us females against adam when adam was telling me to go die already from my cancer however she got fired and tommy took a picture of her report of the event and sent to adams cell... who shouldn't been fired here ? I will never come back to this bar ever another due to the two facts.. they allowed adam to come back after how he treats female players and mary was fried when it should be tommy. Tommy has allowed this to go on for so long and then to take a pic of her report and sent it to adam is to me grounds of being fired. I will be telling my friends that servers and bartender to never go in there."}

When the burger arrived it was substantial. I've never been unable to finish a single burer but  this was huge and the fries were plentiful also. The burger itself was perfectly cooked and the bacon and bleu cheese were very nice. Much better that the new chain burgers places. The place is very small and quiet. I have been back by myself and with co-workers. All the portions have been huge. Cobb salad is excellent also."}

We were here during late lunch hours, like 2-3pm.  The menu looked like there was a lot of options that sounded good, but since it was still lunch for us I went with a simple chicken strip meal with fries.  I was going to order 4  chicken strips for my kid, but the nice waitress strongly suggested I go smaller because according to her the chicken strips were huge.  OK, she was NOT lying!!!  We got 6 total for me and my son to share.  These could not be classified as strips, they were like 6 huge chicken breasts and they were cripspy on the outside and very tasty.  My wife ordered a mushroom blueu cheese burger.  Her burger looked amazing (although I do not like mushrooms or blueu cheese).  There was so much bleue cheese sauce and mushrooms all over the place.  In my opinion, better to have too much on it than not enough.  She was thoroughly satisfied with her meal.  I could spend 10 minutes ranting and raving about the fries alone.  They were thick, but yet very crispy on the ouside.  I am not sure what they use, if it's some kind of batter on the fries or what, but I love the crispy texture while maintaining the excellent mushy potato insides.  They also have waffle fries which I will want to try on a future visit.  The waitress was very kind, and patient with us.  We took our time looking over the menu and asking her questions.  They have about 10 sauce flavors to choose from for the wings/fingers.  I tried one my wife thought I might like, but of course I ended up not liking that one..lol.  In the end I settled with the hottest flavor they offer which was pretty darn hot, and I mixed it with a standard hot buffalo sauce for the perfect blend for me.  I did not go into the bar because I was with family and I don't do the bar scene anyways.  Ive also heard it is very smokey in there, but the dinning area was clean and nice.  They have TV's to watch sports or whatever.  Some may think the price is a bit spendy, but considering the size and quality of the food, I was happy with the cost.  I think for the 3 family members, we spent around $30 which isn't bad at all.  That includes our sodas.  I will be coming back to try some of the dinner options, burgers, and nachos at least.  I definetly recommend this place to anyone who might be in the area.  Also, just wanted to mention, it wasn't that busy when I was there.  Only 1-2 other groups of customers at any point while I was there."}

I initially scoped this place out because they served open faced hot roast beef sandwiches which hardly anyone serves up anymore. My husband was happy that I found this place and the gravy laden mashed potatoes and tender beef satisfied his taste buds and tummy. I like the bourbon glazed carrots that comes with it myself as well!   Mooching off Mr. B's plate: Gravy Fries! - only resto I know that serves it lunch dinner breakfast time.  Either brown gravy or country gravy smothered on french fries. It's good, but a little too salty for my taste.  The Bourbon BBQ Burger is another favorite that is ordered. Mr. B goes on and on how it's the best!(better than Fatburger)  The burger seasoned and juicy, comes with bacon and a bourbon sauce.   Lunch favorites- Baked garlic chicken wings topped with shredded Parmesan cheese , Sweet potato tots, deep fried, crisp out, moist inside. Mushroom burger with blue cheese cream sauce, it's different twist on a mushroom burger, I like how they smother the Burger in the sauce. You need a fork and knife though to eat it.  The turkey wrap with turkey, bacon and cranberry cream cheese and alfalfa sprouts is nice for a lighter lunch.   The Southern Stack for breakfast or 2am cravings..Cornbread topped with sausage patties, eggs over easy and smothered in a hamburger gravy ...think the Southern version of the Hawaiian Loco Moco ;) Prime Rib dinner on Thursday nights! Dessert I have yet to order.   The atmosphere, family friendly, laid back & casual, come in your shorts, sweats, (and dare I say roll in your pj's in the AM?) Just walk in and seat yourself.  Main room of restaurant is larger. Clean, never too crowded.  Boothes can seat 4 people comfortably, table seating can accommodate larger parties.  Bar area is separated by wall and closed doors. It reeks of cigarettes but that is expected. There are smaller boothes to dine set against wall. Late nights you have to get buzzed in. This place has been here since the strip mall opened and has outlasted many of the shops that have come and gone.   Service has always been spot on at all times even in the bar area.  Always friendly, they get our orders right even with the special requests we ask for. Drinks always filled. We're never rushed out of there.  It's not outstanding, oh-my-goodness kind of food by all means, but it does not disappoint and it's affordable.  Cant go wrong with that!"}

Went in and asked the most important question. Do you use trans fat free oil?? Yes!! Perfect, I'm in. The cool part is the inside. Modern look and cozy atmosphere. They have one side restaurant and the other side is bar, some bar machines and tables. The menu is straight up COMFORT food. They specialize in American Fusion. From their Famous Mac n Cheese, Pot Roast Sandwich with Buttery Mash Potatoes and bourbon glazed carrots, Citrus Marinated Chicken Fingers from Scratch with up to 12 sauces to try. Incredible selection of hand made burgers and fresh made pizza. Interesting to say the least. They have a Cheeseburger Pizza with mustard, ketchup, onions, pickles, burger, lettuce and tomato. Im sure thats whats in it, can't remember since I don't have the menu in front of me lol. Someone had ordered it across from us and it looked freaking good. The Nacho Burger was amazing. Big hand made beef patty, grilled to perfection, topped with black olives, jalapeños, tortilla chips, nacho cheese sauce on a toasted bun with Freedom Fries. Gooey goodness on a perfectly cooked beef patty. The Blackened Chicken Sandwich was spectacular. Marinated and blackened seasoned Chicken breast on a toasted wheat bun, topped with pineapple salsa, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions and served with Freedom Fries. The Fries are so crispy and perfectly seasoned with their own special seasoning salt. They definitely make you addicted. I felt like a pig after devouring everything and wanting more fries. But I resisted lol. The chicken fingers were AMAZING!!! Fresh chicken fillets that are marinated in Citrus. Then freshly hand battered and fried perfectly crisp. The sauces to choose from range from mild to Nuclear hot. They even have a caption no refunds if its to hot lol. I prefer Buffalo Hot cuz I iove the flavor or an authentic buffalo wing. I can go on and on. The menu is definitely something try and enjoy. Can't wait to try some of their pastas and comfort food selections. Until next time, LET'S EAT!!!!"}

Henry's is a place that just simply gets it when it comes down to making a perfect hamburger or for any sandwich for that matter. They are spot on all their menu items.  To start, their menu is an eclectic display of the American menu - burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizzas and breakfasts.  I haven't had a meal I didn't like there.  My two favorites are their burgers and their Prime Rib sandwich called 'The Hank'.  This is a must sandwich everyone needs to try one time - request it medium rare.  Believe me, it's the perfect blend of flavors mixed in with the cheese, green bell peppers and onions.  On top of that adding another layer of flavors when you dip it in the au jus, totally tantalizing the tastebuds.  Although, most folks may think it's bar food.  The restaurant side is family friendly - it's simple and service is timely."}

Walking in, we noticed it was quiet for a Saturday afternoon (lunch hour) but they had a few families enjoying meals here so that was a good sign. They decorated for Halloween which we liked, makes it feel welcoming. Also noticed they have a lot of specials posted on the boards up front and they sounded pretty good on top of the fact there are specials every day of the week.   We sat at a small booth side table and within a few minutes we were greeted by Morgan. She was great! Very sweet, gave us time to check the menu and was very attentive. Brought us our drinks and mini pitchers for refills, good move because bae constantly needs refills, lol!   Food: We started with a bowl of their Baked Potato Soup to share. Morgan was not kidding when she said to be ready for the best soup! It was amazing. Awesome portion, great flavor, hearty and chunky. We're looking forward to trying other options once the weather cools down!  We ordered the country fried steak meal with mashed potatoes and veggies and the blackened chicken sandwich sub onion bun and with the waffle fries. The country fried steak was tender, meaty and has the right amount of crunch and the gravy complimented the mash and veggies well too. The meal also came with a dinner roll and a cinnamon/spice spread that was so good (even dipped the fries into it.) Definitely recommend if you like a good southern inspired meal.  The blackened chicken sandwich was well seasoned and juicy, and the pineapple salsa alongside it was a fresh compliment to the blackened spices.   If you're looking for a relaxed, casual local spot check this place out.   Looking forward to stopping in again and trying other options on their menu!"}

I recently snagged a Turkey Club at 2am on a Monday. It came with sweet potato tater tots. I couldn't believe how fresh the turkey was; it was carved (seemingly fresh) and NOT processed. The sweet potato tots tasted fresh, too -- not from a larger food service distributor.   The bar is smoky and the service can be a little slow. It's definitely a place for regulars. That said, you can call in a take-out order 24 hours a day and get a truly quality meal.   As far as I'm concerned: Henry's is a gem.   (Note: If you're a video poker player, their pay tables are not ideal. However, I imagine that's where the great happy hour, and reasonable prices come into play)"}

The place was not crowded, but walking in we weren't sure whether to seat ourselves or wait.  So after a minute of waiting, we just decided to sit down.  It took awhile to get menus or a drink order although the waitress did acknowledge us after we got seated.  She was very friendly and once we were finally waited on, the service was great.  The food was good - portions were enormous!  My daughter had the mac and cheese which she loved (it had roasted red peppers in it which was yummy).  I had a nacho burger. I liked it, but it was so sloppy it shouldn't have come with a bun.  In fact, I ended up eating it with a fork and leaving the bun on the plate.  I think any of the other burgers would have been better - the burger itself was good but the flavors of the nacho toppings did nothing for me.  I like that they bring out little pitchers of soda so you don't have to wait for refills.  I don't know why, but that was kind of cool. The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable. The décor was not memorable but for a family meal in a diner like this, we didn't come here for the décor.    The prices were average but the portions were worth it.  We'll try Henry's again one day for sure."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "From the outside Henry's doesn't seem to belong where it is. It's not a standalone establishment, which threw me off a little bit because the outside doesn't match the inside in a way.  In fact I pass by this place every day, and honestly haven't even given it a second glance until I ate there for breakfast with some friends. I was very surprised by the openness of the place, the portion of my meal and the quality of the food.   For me, I like mom and pop places, non-corporate and non chain food places.  I like to eat at places that are different so that when people come to town, we aren't always going to Denny's, I-hop, Olive Garden etc.  That so happened to be the case when my family visited and wanted to eat somewhere new.  I took them to Henry's and my brother commented that this was just the place he was looking for.  Good comfort food, great quality and great value.  I had a HAHA moment when we ordered french fries, and our server said they don't serve french fries. because being an American Grill there is no such thing.  Instead, they offer freedom fries...see HAHA.  8-)  Quick tip/tidbit of info - it's open 24 hours a day, and they offer free mints at the front.  These aren't your typical peppermints - they are chocolate mints.  Like Andes chocolate from olive garden, but you can get more than just 1, and it's hard so it lasts longer.  Aside from the overall greatness, it's the little things that make me a repeat customer."}

The pulled pork sandwich and waffle fries are a classic combo, and you can order many things on the menu past midnight and the bill will rarely go past $10 because of their late-night deals. Their pulled-pork sandwich is made just right with tender pork and soft bread. The waffle fries are your everyday fries and you can mix them in with your sandwich for a one-way ticket to no-regrets guilty eating.  The staff is friendly as you cant find past midnight, but the place itself has a cigarette aroma because of the bar next door.

The Dogs are unusual and delicious.    Heads up - if you want a $1.50 hot dog go to the Fremont St. Experience because this isn't the place for you. You can guzzle crappy drinks with that dog.  This place is miles removed from that kind of experience.  I had the Mac & Cheese Dog which was delicious - it needs to have a little added but that is dependent on taste . . .a little salt . . . a little hot sauce.   The Mt. Fuji is not to be missed.  Next time in I'm going for the Carolina Slaw Dog and/or but most probably and the PBB&JJ dog.     There are tater tots, crinkle fries and onion rings to go with the dogs. Over 50 kinds of cold vintage sodas, seating and a smiling staff.  The owner is engaging and fun to speak with. Without a restaurant to their name they dived into this creation and  I'm a fan.

The menu was decent sized, so I asked the cashier (whom I think was also the owner) which items were most popular. He gave me statistics on his top 5 dogs, which I was impressed with.  I ended up with the Mac n Cheese dog and I also asked for tittle bacon wrapped. Yes please!  My friend ordered a dog and also the loaded tots. We sat down and waited for out order and when it was ready, someone brought it out to us. I don't think this was normal, but since there wasn't very many people in the shop they seemed very accommodating.   I cannot tell you how good my hotdog was! The dog itself tasted like a sausage, not a ball park hotdog.  Plus the crispy bacon took it to a whole other level.  The mac and cheese topping was so cheesy it tasted better than it sounded on the menu.  I tried my friends loaded tots and they were just ok. However I would like to try the salchipapas on their menu next time! Salchipapas are french fries with hot dog bits on top and other miscellaneous toppings.  When we were done, someone from the back came and cleared our table, even though we could have done so ourselves. This is a great establishment, and I will definitely be back here in the future!"}

After the steam subsided I'd say it was the latter of my statements.   Go figure I found Steamie Weenie TOTALLY at random, but what a find indeed and by no means does the 5 star even do this place justice! Overall this was just simply perfection from beginning to end! I mean c'mon now see my pictures of how they segregate the bathrooms even (a weenie for the males and buns for the ladies). How can you go wrong?!?  Location wise it is based out of a small, but blossoming strip mall in Henderson and actually was not really much of a drive from the strip as well so certainly something doable. We were coming from the Southern Highland area (near the M casino) and it took roughly about 15 minutes and the restaurant itself was not that difficult to spot, but with a name like Steamie Weenie even in Vegas that tends to stand out? Ha-ha.  From perusing the menu ahead of time it was one of those has something for every member of the family type of menus. It had the regular go-to's for the kids, and what certainly made this outing even possible a vegan based hot dog (as I had a member who passed until she heard about the vegan hot dog offering) so definitely even among how it looks on the outside it was quite healthy on the inside.  As for the food, I did find everything to be surprisingly light and I did not feel like I needed to be carted out on a gurney afterwards which is a testament to the attention to health here. I went for the loaded tots as a side and they were prepared to golden brown perfection with a light crisp to it, but absent was the oodles of grease I'm used to getting pretty much everywhere else. Not scrimped on here was the loaded portion of the tots. The sour cream was lightly drizzled on the top of mounds of melted cheese, scallions, and the crowd pleasing: bountiful chunks of BACON!    Now for the main attraction set to knock your tooth out, the trailer park hot dog! There was a lot going on in this dog, but somehow it all comes together and works marvelously. It starts with the great tasting all beef foot long hot dog that had the much sought after snap with each bite (I appreciated that more than anything). From here it was engulfed in piles of crispy fried onion strings, to die for coleslaw that would make the south rise up again, and literal chunks of spam (I think I had the equivalent of maybe two thick slices of it actually). What sets it apart though was for one the beer cheese (and yes there's a difference) and the watermelon BBQ sauce. It had me wanting to shout OH YEEEEEAH like the kool-aid man during each bite!  All in all this place is amazing. We did strike up a conversation with the owners as we walked out and I'm very impressed at how humble they were, but also just the care that they put into what they do. We were treated like family and I really begged them to open up a restaurant in California so I didn't dream of this in between Vegas trips. So definitely when you want a well prepared hot dog don't waste time on the strip and channel your inner dog. Think steamie and even think weenie and trek on over here as you will NOT be disappointed!"}

I hope this place does well for many years to come. It is nice to have a place in Henderson for a good dog!

This was also very underwhelming. The flavors were not very dynamic. The whole time I felt as though I could make this at home myself.   Order:  Chili Mac Dog: hot dog topped with chili and mac & cheese.  2/5  Corn dog: basic nothing special. 2/5  Baked potato tots: basic nothing special. The beer cheese didn't add any real benefits as far as flavor. If anything melted cheddar would have been a better approach. 2/5"}

Somehow its never the same the second time, but still good. I ordered the jalapeno popper and my gf the Coney Island. Both were prepared quickly and presentation was amazing. They looked picture perfect. This was no McDonalds bait and switch. The Jalapeno Popper tasted exactly like a jalapeno popper and was amazing! My gf said the Coney Island was good. I can usually tell if she likes a menu item by the look on her face, what she says after her first bite, and if she finishes it. The Coney Island looked like a winner. The second time we ordered, the presentation was a a bit messy and the temperature was luke warm. We DID order ahead (maybe this is a factor). But for some reason, crushed expectations changes the flavor :(   Nevertheless we still love this place.   This is one of the best places to satisfy your gourmet hot dog craving.  I use to hate hog dogs. I remember having to eat those plastic wrapped poisonous wieners from the regular grocery stores when I was younger.

Steamie Weenie is the latest arrival to the culinary category of creatively topped dogs. There are so many cool dogs to try, some of the classics like the Windy City Chicago dog, the chili- and mustard-topped Coney, and the Carolina Slaw Dog.  Among the goofiest are: The Georgia Scramble, adds a pile of oyster crackers to mustard, ketchup, chili, onions and pickles. The 9th Island is mountain of fried Spam cubes atop a tangy grilled pineapple relish.   I've tried a few, my favorite one is Jalapenos Popper Dog. Its loaded Beer and Cream cheese with Jalapenos. (Yum!) See when food tastes good, my rationale tends to fail on me. I thought it would be fun to mix the Yucatan and the Sriracha sauce together for extra kick. Needless to say I caused myself unnecessary pain for being stupid. I still managed to finish it though.  I'm used to mixing my mac&cheese with hot dog meat, so I had to pick the next logical choice the M&C&C, this dog tastes awesome!! It can get really messy if your able to eat it with your hands, I'd suggest eating it with utensils.  The staff are nice people especially Bob (the owner).

I thought everything was really tasty, great quality, and the winning touch for me was that buns were steamed!!!

The atmosphere was great. It was clean and appeared to be new? Very nice.  The bad. Way, way, way over priced!!!. This meal cost 15.48. Being from Chicago no hotdog stand would stay in business charging so much. For a couple of dogs, fries and water should be 6 or 7 dollars at the most. No fountain drinks either. Only fancy high sugar bottles in a cooler to pick from. I chose water because their was no diet selections and was charged 1.25 for a 16oz bottle. The next customer asked for a glass of water and the just gave the water to him without charge. Seemed odd to give to one and charge another?  I won't be back because of the price. 16 for 2 dogs is not what I'm willing to spend on a lunch. But good luck to the owner because the details are good and you can see his heart is in the joint."}

I must say that I was not at all disappointed.  For starters, the owners are extremely friendly and welcoming.  Great people with great attitudes are the basis for a great experience.  They knocked it out of the park for me.  The decor is simple and colorful as one would hope/expect out of a hot dog spot.  Seating for about 20-30.  Standard fare aside from the custom painted wall which was a nice touch.  The menu!  I stood there chatting it up because I just couldn't decide what to choose.  All of the options were so creative.  I know I will be back to try several items but, this day, I decided to go with the following...  1 Trailer Park 1 side of Mac n Cheese 1 IBC bottled root beer  Total came out to 11.31.  Not the cheapest of meals but this wasn't your ordinary dog and side.  While not any one of the ingredients were outstanding, the combination was very satisfying.  It reminded me of my days as a child while integrating tastes I had acquired as an adult.  Very cool experience.  The mac n cheese was much better than I expected.  Had I not ordered it, I would have been all over a beer cheese option.  All in all, I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new and unique when it comes to the classic hot dog.  As a note, the only reason I am not giving a full 5 star rating today is for a couple of reasons.  1) Fountain drinks should be an option for those that want to save a little money.  The bottled selection they offer is great but having options would be nice.  2) The standard franks, while lengthy, aren't very robust.  I picked my dog based on the fact that there was an added protein topper.  Will be trying the hot link or bacon wrapped upgrade next time.  Congrats on the opening!"}

Husband had the PBB & JJ, bacon wrapped dog with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly, he loved it. He also got the Carolina, has slaw, watermelon rind bbq sauce and pulled pork, he didn't finish it, he didn't care for it. I think it was a bit bland. I ordered the Maxwell, I chose the hot link, comes with grilled onions, mustard, beer cheese and peppers, so good!! We also had loaded tots and floats.

The dogs themselves were flavorful and all beef.  We will go back to try more of their creations.  I do have some criticisms that prevent me from giving 5 stars.  (Actually, I'd give this a 3.5 rating because of these criticisms, but I rounded up because I like the dogs.)  For one, I think it is a mistake to upcharge for different styles of hotdog meat.  The menu items themselves are priced high enough that you should have the option to have a local link or an all beef dog or a brat for the same price.  I would love to try the local links but I'm not willing to turn my $7 hotdog into $8.  They only sell bottled beverages, and they add a hefty price to your total bill.  The basic sides, while inexpensive, are not good quality.  The onion rings were obviously frozen battered and the fries were also obviously frozen first."}

I got a plain hot dog, chili-cheese fries, and a bottled root beer for $13.05.  Pretty expensive but it might be worth it if you got one of the more exotic hot dogs. That's the only reason to ever return here, really.    Peeves:  1) The majority of my fries were completely raw in the middle.  I'm talkin' crunchy raw potato, folks.  It wasn't pretty.   2) Cockroach in the corner.  Not a big deal, it can happen to the best of us.  Doesn't mean it's a dirty place.  But sweep it up for crissakes.   3) The ketchup on the table was empty but the mustard was brand new.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Yummy! I really like trying new hot dog flavors and The Steamie Weenie does a really good job on putting together different flavor combos together. Be on the lookout for their Specials because it's usually a limited time flavor like for St.Party's Day they had a corned beef hot dog with sauerkraut which was pretty good. The hot dog bun is nicely steamed too and that makes the hot dog experience complete. They also offer craft sodas if you want something cold and bubbly to go with your meal. The sides are all comfort goodness. I really like the loaded tater tots. It comes with bacon pieces, sour cream, and sliced green onions.    Service is always professional and down to earth. It's a mom and pop shop and they make the effort to make you feel welcomed and are grateful for your business. They take the time and care to put the food together from prepping to presentation. Even on the to go orders! The food is never hastily thrown in a box or smashed together no matter how busy they get. As simple as a hot dog may seem, the fact that the workers care about how you get the food when you get home says a lot about the pride they take on their food and service. Definitely give this place a try."}

We also picked up a unique Pumpkin flavored soda from their collection of sodas which was delicious!   Their menu does offer different variations of the hotdog, all of which sound amazing.

We were pleasantly surprised that they offered vegan dogs ($0.99 extra), but even more surprised by how yummy their hotdogs were!  And not too heavy on the stomach, either.  Our typical orders are:  Mac & Cheese, Jalapeno Popper, and Mt. Fuji all with vegan dogs.    Family-owned business, super friendly staff, and they always keep the restaurant clean!

Perhaps a spicy red salsa would be much better. It had plenty of beans.   The loaded potato tots were better than the dog, for me, and they were a pile of greasy goodness!

This is not the normal hot dogs u get at the grocery store for 3.99....these are real genuine quality hot dogs!

There are quality hot dogs out there and please don't expect to pay what u pay for hot dogs at the grocery store.  You pay for what u get. :) and for me...Steamie Weenie was absolutely worth every penny. I can't wait to go back!! :)  Now enough of my vent....:)  I went with my bf and we ended up getting 3 hot dogs and an order of tater tots with chili and cheese.  Let me tell u...the tots were for real. Crisp on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside like any good tater tot should be. :)  My bf had the Coney Style....And he absolutely loved it!!!  I was the little porker and had the Mt. Fuji and the bratwurst special. :)  Let me begin the review for the hot dogs and say....WOW....the buns were freaking amazing!!! :)  They were soft and almost just melted in your mouth. :)  The Mt. Fuji came with teriyaki onions, green onions, carrots and wasabi mayo....let's just say it was bomb. The carrots gave it that nice crunch and the onions a nice little bit of sweetness and the vienna hot dog had the best snap and alot of flavor without all that saltiness that I get with regular hot dogs. And of course I can't forget the nori....:) it added just a little without overpowering the entire dish for that umami flavor. :)  And what can I say about the bratwurst....it was delicious. Had just the right amount of mustard and sauerkraut for that perfect bite. :)  And if u love spicy food like I love spicy food....get their Habanero sauce. Omg....it added so much flavor and a nice but of heat.....soooooo good!!!  And if u ask nicely....they'll even sell u a bottle....:)  I can't wait to go back and try their other hot dogs...yum yum yum....:)"}

I tried to explain to him about my order and he proceeded to keep interrupting me.   I recently placed my own order to just try the food here to have a better FOOD review as well. The hot dogs are just like any other ones you would get elsewhere, but just really was not what I expected.

It is decorated simple yet fun with dark wood floors and Steamie weenie spray painted on the wall. They offer not only gourmet hot dogs with interesting combinations of flavors but several sides as well as the coolest bottled soda collection I have seen.   We were welcomed immediately as we walked in. They were happy to offer suggestions as it was our fist time. I went with the Carolina slaw dog and a side of tots. The Carolina dog has coleslaw, pulled pork, diced onions and their famous watermelon rind bbq sauce which is excellent. Everything went together really well. My only minor complaint was that I thought the actual hot dog got a little lost as it was on the smaller side. The tots were good but could have been crispier.   I will definately be returning to try several other things on the menu such as the trailer park dog, onion rings, the mac n cheese and that pumpkin pie soda I saw. If your in the mood for a dog this is the place to go."}

I have always dreaded pulling into it's maze of parking barriers, funky travel lanes occupied by crabby angry people wanting to play bumper cars with you.  We were in Hendo recently and in need of sustenance.  Despite the heinous parking lot, PM is filled with little gems.  I rolled into the parking lot and assumed the form of water traveling all the paths of least resistance until I found a spot on the north end.  Still not sure where to dine, we spied Steamie Weenie.  I had seen it was trending on yelp and with that developed a hankering for a hot dog.  I pitched the idea to the GF and did some quick research on yelp to see if they had a turkey dog or something similar to sweeten the proposition.  She agreed to visit with the promise of a vegan frankfurter.    We entered and were greeted by Bob, the owner.  He happily explained the menu.  I spotted the Nor'Wester.  It consisted of cream cheese, grilled onions, jalapeños, scallions and siracha.  I asked if I could swap the regular dog for one wrapped in bacon.  Not a problem.  The crunch of bacon with the cream cheese was an awesome combination.  The bun was moist and very soft.  The GF got a Mac & Cheese dog with a vegan frank.  The Boy got something off the menu that was spicy with some fries on the side.    There is no soda machine.  You do however, have your choice of an assortment of bottled traditional and novelty sodas.  When I am on this side of the valley again, I would absolutely look Steamie Weenie up again!"}

The weenie on the wall is adorable. Most of the tables are high top tables, but some of the chairs have backs. A place to hang my purse! This excites me more than it should because normally I hate tall tables.   Both of the people working were really friendly. I could tell they want to be successful and appreciate their customers.   I had the Windy City dog. The hotdog was larger than the standard hot dog and delicious. The toppings were plentiful and tasty. The ingredients seemed fresh and better than what I expected from a hot dog place. For example, the diced tomatoes were definitely fresh and not from a can.   My husband had the Tucson and Georgia Scramble. I tasted these and loved them. As with my dog the toppings were plentiful and fresh. The Tucson starts with a bacon wrapped dog so you can't go wrong with that.  We split the Tot Chos which was like a frito pie (sub tots for fritos). So good! Hopefully I'm not giving them too much credit, but the chili seemed homemade or they chose good chili because I loved it. It wasn't like the canned chili my husband sneaks into the house.

For a side, I had the Tot-Chos, which are tater tots with shredded cheddar cheese, chili, sour cream, jalapenos, and tomatoes. Like nachos, but replace the chips with tater tots. More of a traditional and familiar side order flavor profile. Also delicious.  This doesn't get five stars because of price. The PBB&JJ was $6.29 and the Tot-Chos were $4.59. For about $12 after tax, it was definitely a delicious meal, but I was still hungry.

We also got a side of Tator Tots to share which I really liked, they made them nice and crispy, not greasy. Used some fry sauce for dipping, I'd go back for Tots.

I had the Pushcart Hot Dog  which was very good and the ends extended over the bun and had a nice crunch on the ends. I had the loaded baked potato tots which were good too. No soda fountain, bottle soda and water only  and kinda expensive for a hot dog but I will be back!"}

My husband ordered a rather boring Maxwell Street hot link, which he said was really good.  I wanted to be a little more adventurous, so I got a bacon wrapped jalapeño popper dog.  It was really tasty!  I loved the flavor of the beer cheese on it.  We also split a mac & cheese & cheese dog which was yummy as well, next time I might add grilled onions to it, though.  Shared an ordered of pickle fries, too -- the best I've ever had, I was confused at first 'cuz I'd only ever had sliced fried pickles & these looked like fries.  The ranch we had to dip them in was perfect. This place isn't close to our house, but we'll be heading back there soon 'cuz there are several other weenies I want to try. Oh, the only thing I didn't like was the lack of fountain drinks.  My root beer was really good, but overpriced.  I was still thirsty, but didn't want to pay another $2.50 for a second drink.  That made it a 4 star review for me."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "If you have not tried SW....redirect your car, SUV, truck, cab, motor scooter, bicycle, skateboard, Razor, or feet here! My first visit was to do a little hot dog recon (military vet here!), purchasing four different hot dogs to take back to a gathering for...taste examination: BLT dog, Carolina Slaw dog, Mac n' Cheese dog, and Windy City dog. The outcome: Mac n' Cheese got thumbs up! BLT got thumbs up! Carolina Slaw got thumbs up! Windy City...got thumbs tentatively up (the neon green relish combined with the peppers,      not so much, but the overall taste, good). If you are not a fan of the peppers, just leave       those off!  Yes, all their drinks are bottled, so if having the fountain type drink is your thing, you can STILL have a GREAT hot dog, tots (even specialty tots!), root beer float.  If you would prefer, you can bring your fountain soda in with you. Seriously, even checked with the owner and he was cool with that. Now, they have over 24 types of bottled sodas (including the line of Fanta's!!!!), bottled lemonade, tea, and bottled water. If you have children who may not be able to handle a glass bottle, they have cups behind the counter.  I'm not sure where the idea of the menu being painted on the wall was seen. When you walk in the door, if you turn to your left there is a large, framed area where the menu has been printed by category. If you want to see an individual one, they are right there to the left of the register. When they are really busy (I was there this past Saturday and wow....lots of people!!!!), you may want to just ask for a menu so you can be looking over your choices while you are waiting to order. That might be something to consider...having an employee zip around out there when they are really really busy and thank folks for coming, hand them a menu so they can connect before they get to the register.   Today was my third Carolina Slaw dog in.....I really shouldn't admit to this....about 10 days. I know, I know.....I'm going to turn into a hot dog! But hey, what a way to go!!!!  In terms of price, you will pay essentially what you pay when you go through that fast food drive thru. Seriously...by the time you order one of those numbered selections and respond yes to making it a large and add tax, it is about the same give or take a dollar or two. The hot dogs and toppings are a great size/helping and I can't imagine going away hungry....unless you were nice enough to share yours with someone so you didn't get the whole thing!!!!  Today was yes, the Carolina Slaw dog, a root beer float (I chose O-So Butterscotch Root Beer for mine), a side of tots, and a bottled soda. The atmosphere is indigenous to the type of business it is. Picture yourself at a hot dog stand on a busy street in New York City. You walk up to the vendor, order your dog, and you stand there eating it....you might see folks juggling a soda or maybe they found a bench nearby and sat down. It's exactly what I would expect...stand around a high table and enjoy....sit on one of the stools available at the tables. There are two regular height tables with chairs as well. The restaurant is ADA compliant in terms of access for wheelchairs, motorized chairs, etc. If you were to come in and need one of the two regular tables and they were taken, I can't begin to imagine that someone wouldn't move to make it available for you. :-)  Long review, but getting into this marketplace with all the other food establishments must be a challenge. I say....if you haven't tried one, c'mon......give it a try!!!!! YUM!"}

We tried Buldogis before so we figure the name here caught our attention and boy was this place a hidden gem pretty much. The flavors on the dogs we got mixed so well and nothing overpowered the other. I would even go ahead and say this place is better than buldogis just simply because the preparation and portion size is on point.  I got the Carolina which has pulled pork, slaw and an in house made watermelon bbq sauce. This one was not over sauced like some places that smother the pulled pork in sauce, the slaw was very good and not watery at all, plus they used a Nathan's all beef dog and a soft bun to compliment the ingredients.  My wife ended up getting the BLT and damn that was good too. There was just the right amount of toppings in this with a nice bacon wrapped Nathan's dog fried nicely. The last thing we got for ourselves was the loaded baked tots, it wasn't overly cheesy or heavy after eating any of this. We could do our hike afterward without the bloated feeling like some hot dog spots give you."}

I actually had Steamie Weenie bookmarked and heard about this place from someone before.  I stuck with the classic Cheese Chili Cheese dog with added diced onions and jalapeños. It was good, nothing extraordinary. Tasted like a chili cheese dog.  After trying my boyfriend's hotdog, that he custom made, I wished I had done that too. So he got the Vienna dog wrapped in bacon with spicy mustard, mayo, diced onions, scallions, jalapeños, and sauerkraut. It was a beauty and the flavors exploded in my mouth. It was so good that I think they should make this a staple on their menu.  Overall, I will probably be back. But it's not cheap. The two hotdogs with one side of tater tots and 2 drinks set us back $20."}

I would have liked to get a cup of water and keep refilling it because I was thirst and can't afford to pay $3-4 every time I want to buy another drink. Also, I HIGHLY suggest a glass recycling bin for all those soda bottles. I came with friends and we went through 9 glass bottles of sodas in our one visit and they all went in the regular trash. All those glass bottles not being recycled everyday? Just my two cents :) give this place a try! SO many non-plain Jane options. You won't be disappointed :)"}

Overall, a great addition to my neighborhood, particularly because I love hot dogs and the owners of this local store really care. The only con is that it is pretty pricy. Each time, I spent $7-$8 on a specialty hot dog. It was enough for a meal, but more along the lines of what I'd expect to pay at a tourist site (although this is better quality).  To start, they care a lot about the food. When I tried the brats and the dogs, the owners talked about how many different suppliers and dogs they tried. They tried a bunch of sauerkrauts for the bratwurst too. And the bread is soft and fluffy, and the tater tots were fried up super crispy and fresh and salted just right. These little things show that they are paying attention to the food. Each dog is grilled after you order it, so it's much, much better than a boiled dog or a roller dog. The dogs had a nice casing and good snap with juicy insides. I will be back regularly when the mood for a dog strikes!"}

I don't know how else to describe my meal beside saying it was delicious.   Today was my first time coming to Steamie Weenie and it did not disappoint. I've been craving for a good hot dog for the past week. Normally, I'd say lets go to Pink's but I live in downtown Henderson and hate driving in the traffic on the Strip. My fiancé recommended this place and now I found my new hot dog joint. This is definitely a place to check out."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Gourmet hotdogs are a trend many people would like to see die already. Lucky for this spot, I am not one of those people. The weird name, cute logo, low prices, and a wide variety of menu offerings make this place a hot-diggity darn good spot.   Follow them on social media to find out about their off-menu specials, such as the Run, Run, Rudolph dog for December: reindeer sausage topped with caramelized onions and sriracha cream. Simple but super tasty, it took a lot of effort to share this with my guy.  Solid menu standbys include the Everything Bagel dog (w/cream cheese and scallions) and the Japanese-inspired Mt. Fuji dog (teriyaki onions, nori, carrots, scallions, wasabi mayo). Don't even get me started on side options (tot-chos, anyone?!).  Location is cozy, service is genuinely friendly, and they even have a condiment bar to doctor up your dog with extra hot sauces and mustards. Don't forget about their house fry sauce and beer cheese!"}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Immediately we were greeted and after made aware that we were newbies, they did not waste any time to explain the menu to us. They also let us sample the jalapeno jelly and the steamie sauce; both of which were very tasty. The jelly was still sweet but had that nice spicy kick for the jalapeño but it wasn't overpowering. The steamie sauce is a mix of mayo, their watermelon rind bbq sauce, and some other secret ingredients.   My fiance got the jalapeño popper dog which had cream cheese, beer cheese and jalapeños slices on the top. It literally tasted like a jalapeño popper so the beer cheese was a nice addition. I got the trailer park dog which had spam, beer cheese, their watermelon rind bbq sauce, coleslaw and crispy onions (which I'm pretty sure is French's crispy fried onions). Super messy, but very tasty.  The real winner was their salchipapas fries. It had thin slices of a hotdog over the bed of crinkle fries along with a good portion of the steamie sauce drizzled on top. I think I'm addicted to the sauce because it complemented the fries so well.  Everything was made to order so everything was fresh,  crunchy and steamie. I will have to try the pbb&jj dog the next time I come back if I am ever in the area again."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Anyone can make a hot dog at home with the usual toppings, but if you want to try some good gourmet dogs, The Steamie Weenie is the place to go. I usually don't eat dogs unless I've got a beer in hand and I'm at a baseball game or picnic, but I was given a gift card and it was loaded up enough to get lunch twice for a party of two. Some of the hot dogs were unique that I haven't seen before and the service was really friendly from this family owned dog-themed restaurant on both of my visits.  If you manage to find parking, you can order at the counter once you enter and enjoy your dog at one of the high tops. The menu consists of some old dogs, some new tricks or you can just custom build your own. They have fries as a side, but I wouldn't miss out on the tots if you're a fan. The loaded potato tots are topped just like a loaded baked potato with some extra crunch added from the fried, shredded taters. If the tots aren't enough of an accompaniment, you can have one of their house made dipping sauces or grab a soda from the cooler and drink it straight from the bottle.  You also can use the Eat 24 app for delivery, or for pick up, which is what I did on my second trip. My order was ready at the requested pick up time and nothing was missed. Out of the four dogs I tried, the Nor'Wester was my favorite with plenty of kick from the sriracha and jalapenos, sweetness from the grilled onions, and some tart from the cream cheese. The More Cowbell was my least favorite solely because the pulled pork was dry.  Steamie Weenie does proclaim that they use Nathan's and Vienna Beef, but when I hear hot dog, words like, processed, nitrates, and mystery meat pop in my head that give a negative connotation. I will still eat them occasionally and enjoy them. Although I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs, I am a fan of this locally owned business and will continue to support them whenever I'm in the mood."}

Located close to Green Valley Ranch, this place serves gourmet hot dogs for very reasonable prices. My favorite is the PB&JJ hoy dog, which is a hot dog with peanut butter and jalapeño jelly to top it off. Let me tell you, don't knock it 'til you try it! Being a little daring and listening to the cashier's recommendations, I ordered it my first time visiting and it has been my ultimate favorite ever since.  As many have stated, follow their social media accounts to keep in track of their revolving speciality hot dogs. For instance, they have speciality hot dogs during Thanksgiving, Mardi Gras, etc. Sometimes, they even pair up with local charities and give some of the proceeds to them if you buy said hot dogs. Great hotdogs for a great cause, right?  Don't forget to try some of the sides they offer! Loaded Tot-chos and Doggy Style Tots? Yum! The names are as fun as the deliciousness of the items.  Service is as great as the food. Never once had a bad experience. Come and check this place out! There's nothing weenie about anything here!"}

I must say the Carolina slaw dog was my favorite! Pulled pork on a steamie weenie with slaw and watermelon rind bbq sauce. The flavors were bold and they popped! My jalapeño popper dog was just as good, everything is good when you add cream cheese and jalapeño though in my opinion. Their Chile cheese fries were also delicious and just the right amount too. Our order was under 20 which you can't beat considering its lunch for two. I am looking forward to coming back and trying their other dogs!"}

I didn't try it because I personally don't like Chicago dogs but my boyfriend said it was really good.   Cheese chili cheese dog-beer cheese, chili, and melted shredded cheese. Really good chili cheese dog. I shared with my boyfriend because it was big.   Kids puppy dog-smaller hot dog served with crinkle fries. Perfect for kids.   Kids Jr corn dog-fresh battered corn dog. Actually really large so lucky me since my son couldn't finish it and I got to snag a few bites. Crunchy batter that was really good. Also served with crinkle cut fries.   Loaded baked potato tots-tater tots piled with cheese, bacon, sour cream, and green onions. So good that I'm already craving them as I write this review.   We asked for a water and they gave us a bottled water which was really nice.   We also got 3 ice cream floats for happy hour. Really cool to choose a vintage soda to pair with the two scoops of ice cream.   The food was really good and filling. The service was amazing. I didn't catch the name of the cashier but he was so helpful and even on his way out of work he stopped to ask us how everything was. Great food and service will definitely have me back for more."}

Immediately the name caught my eye and what I saw briefly of the menu intrigued me. My boyfriend got the Maxwell classic dog and he loved it, I tried a bite and it had one of the best brats we've ever had in it. The only thing that would improve that dog would be to chop up the grilled onions versus the long slices, but it wouldn't stop us from getting it again. I tried the 9th Island and it was oh so ono! The spam could have been cut into smaller pieces (for easier eating and less falling off to floor) but the pineapple relish was the best! I don't know who provides their local made hot dogs, but they were very good and big! We also loved that they had all glass bottle sodas of different varieties because I am always up for trying ones I've never had.  Be sure to get the steamie sauce which is their watermelon rind BBQ sauce/mayo fry sauce. It is the perfect consistency and tastes great! I would gladly drive across town to come back to this place!"}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I mean, it's probably the best named restaurant in town, ammaright?   The food was decent. I went with the chili-cheese dog. Think it was called the Cheese Chili Cheese. Nothing too notable about it though. The chili was decent, there really wasn't enough cheese on there, despite the extra cheese noted in the name. We did get a side of the beer cheese and honestly that would have been a homerun if there was more of that on there.   I think the best part of Steamie Weenie is their ridiculously awesome variety of bottled sodas. I can't remember which Cream Soda I went with, but it was top notch. They even had Dad's Old Fashioned Root Beer which I haven't seen in many years. Remember when you could get them for a quarter at Costco? Anyways, I think I'd be inspired to go back just for the pop.   The service was excellent, especially for a fast/cas place. The kid who rung us up was super helpful and knew the menu through and through. Appreciated some of the suggestions he was giving on the soda front since that was a bit overwhelming.  This is a strong three star rating, but I'd like to see a little more out of the dogs next time."}

Oh my gosh was it delicious!!!!!!  I'm not sure of all the toppings, but I know it was a bacn wrapped hot dog topped with bleu cheese and grilled onions.  Easily one of the best hot dogs I've ever eaten.  The Jalapeno Popper was good.  I love spicy and this one hit the spot.  I especially liked that the jalapenos were fresh and not pickled.  The creme cheese adds a nice rich creaminess to the dog.  The Loaded Tots was my least favorite item.  I kind of thought the portion was a little small for the price.  Also, the toppings were a little light.  I'd rather have had a third hot dog over ordering these tots.  Overall a great place to grab a bite to eat.  Service was good.

As others have mentioned, they do not have a soda machine here, and a bottled drink (they have the glass bottles drinks here) will run you over $2.00 with no refills.

They had a sign out front saying Wednesdays $2.00 dogs so I thought great, I get to try one at a discount.  The place had several customers eating and my order was taken at the counter immediately by a friendly person.  I asked if the $2.00 dogs applied to Coneys and he said he could dress up a couple of dogs for me.  I ordered 2 Coneys with mustard and onion.  The two dogs came to $6.60.  The buns were almost cold, the chili was luke warm, and tasted as if it was the cheap canned chili.  I was not impressed with the Coneys at all and was actually disappointed.  I thought at least the dogs would be steamed or hot and did not expect the canned chili.  The menu said the Coney's are normally $5.75.  I don't know how they will be able to stay in business selling a cold generic coney with canned chili.  Their other dogs looked appetizing but I did not try any, as I had to hurry home and see if I could get the mustard and chili stains out of my shirt."}

I definitely recommend the Cheerwine while you're there!  (No alcohol in it)"}

They let us know about the new hours they had (open earlier and later) as well as some new dogs they had coming. One of the dogs they mentioned was the Ring of Fire. It sounded like happiness in a bun, so I ordered one. It took about 10 minutes for my order to arrive, and it was worth the wait. The Ring of fire had a chipotle aioli, deep fried jalapeños, and goat peppers. It was flavored beautifully, like a perfect desert sunrise. It was refreshing without burning my taste buds.

I originate from Cali, so I love the bacon wrapped dog and add some grilled onions, mustard and ketchup. Reminds me of the street vendors outside of Staples Center after a Lakers game. Great sides, the baked loaded tots are a great choice and are more than enough to share as well are the onion rings. I also really like the old school bottled sodas they have instead of the fountain drinks. Nice touch to an already great hot dog experience. Best thing is that this is a small business run by a local husband and wife team. Bob is always there and greets everyone with a smile and is eager to assist you on your gourmet dog journey."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "So far so good! What lured me into coming here was the variety of toppings and creative combinations that they have to put on top of your hot dog.   MENU:  They have the favorite regional classics; including Windy City, Coney, Tucson, Carolina.  You can also customize your hot dog too! Choice of beef, bacon wrapped or Vegan one!  Also hot link that's made locally.  The dogs they serve here are Vienna Beef brand, but the owner told me the bacon wrapped ones are Nathan's.  The fun creations: 9th Island! with Pineapple relish and Spam of course! There's one with Mac and Cheese too.   Also novelty items they sell are vintage sodas in glass bottles with retro labels.  Upside: made with pure cane sugar, downside: a little pricier for the amount you get. There's no fountain sodas, so you thirsty soda addicts, don't count on refills.  ORDER OF THE DAY :  I ended up getting the Trailer Park with Beer Cheese, Fried Onions, coleslaw, watermelon rind bbq sauce and SPAM!  Yes you read right, Spam! Hot dogs don't scream healthy eats, so sure more nitrates, why not! I live for cheat day/weekend. Anyways good stuff!  Especially the beer cheese and watermelon bbq sauce. The hot dog buns were soft and our weenies were steamy!   Oh try the crinkle cut fries!  They made these perfect!  I mooched some fries off of Mr.  B's order.  Crunchy exterior and potatoey moist inside . It doesn't taste like those store bought ones which I hate.   I regret not getting my own now.  LOCATION - ATMOSPHERE  This joint is located in Pebble Marketplace, where Smith's is the anchor. Hightop tables and barstools make up most of the seating in dining area. Cool graffiti wall art for deco.   PRICE:   Average... if you look at it from the it's a gourmet dog perspective. I personally think  $6.28 for my dog is a little out there, but don't mind paying, because the toppings they added on justified the cost. But among the hot dog places we dine at, we spent the most amount here. The owners said they will have daily specials and deals coming up so look forward to those.    It's family owned and operated. Staff was really welcoming and helpful!  Bottom line, cool niche for foodies. This place fits right here in Green Valley!"}

Really nice that they care about their vegan customers like that!   The dog was amazing, and I can't wait to try more combos (as well as onion rings!). The actual restaurant is so adorable - I was especially tickled by the plain bun on the door for the women's room, and the hot dog on the men's room door. My boyfriend also asked them for a cup of water and they handed him a full bottle of water. I was so taken aback that we had to tip extra.

The hotdog itself is small... so I don't know if it justifies their prices. With that being said, I've had gourmet hotdogs before- Steemie Weenie isn't as gourmet as I thought they would be. Maybe I came at an off day. Overall, their hotdogs are at par. Hoping to try other toppings. Great job for originality though."}

Some places don't take care in this. The hot dog was good but was very skinny. The mac & cheese was very good. However, I thought $10 was pricey for a skinny hot dog and a tiny side of mac & cheese. I think I might go back for just the mac & cheese."}

Boy oh boy, do these guys know how to make a killer hot dog to satisfy those road trip cravings! Make sure you grab one of the delicious sodas they offer to quench your thirst! Oh, and did I forget to mention, they're also vegetarian friendly which is always good when that one individual in your group of friends is anti-meat. The tots and hot dogs we ordered were beautifully prepared for us! One of the best I've ever had! Will be back!"}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Postmates is now like my go-to way of getting food. Why go out when you can have pretty much everything delivered to you? Including yummy hot dogs from Steamie Weenie.  The to-go packaging was perfect. My dog arrived just exactly how the pictures look. Pretty impressive for to-go / delivery. They also wrap it in foil and then put it in the to-go container. No leakage here.  It was difficult to choose just one dog. I was quite tempted to order 2 or 3. And I have a sneaking suspicion that I would've found a different choice more impressive.  So let's talk about my dog. I ordered the jalapeno popper one as it sounded spicy and unique - cream cheese, beer cheese sauce, and jalapenos. The dog was perfectly cooked. The bun was soft and yummy all on it's own (a rarity when it comes to hot dog buns). And I was impressed that the toppings were just right. It wasn't overwhelming and sloppy where you just taste toppings and not the dog. But they also weren't skimpy on the toppings either. It was definitely very tasty. But I was hoping for some more spiciness. But still, tasty.  I also ordered some crinkle cut fries topped with their beer cheese sauce. Again, perfect amount of cheese. Not so much that the fries got soggy. But not so little that there were naked fries. And the fries were perfectly done.  So while I haven't actually been inside this establishment yet, consider me a fan. And if you're someone who can appreciate finding that perfect middle when it comes to toppings (just the right amount), you'll definitely appreciate this place."}

Went a bit overboard because one GIANT Ohio state fair corn dog or a couple chili cheese dogs would fill me up but I didnt know that so I ordered one of each and some totchos which are nacho tater tots.  Way too much for my fat...um...     The food was delicious, service was excellent and it was clean and a bonus was finding sprechers soda which is very hard to find in Vegas, Zia has cherry but not Grape as this place does!  My only negative would be that it was pricey, $45 for the 2 of us but then again we went overboard...still I wish they had combos, like a chili dog with fries and a soda?      We will return though but probably not for a while, Its time for Christmas shopping for the next 2 months.    :)"}

The guy who took my order was friendly and the inside and tables were clean.   Coney ($5.75) - Vienna beef frankfurter with their special hot dog chili, diced onions and yellow mustard. The hot dogs here are the kind that hang off either side of the bun. I'm not a huge fan of those, I personally like some bun with each bite.  Good amount of mustard and the chili did taste good. They have a lot of different hot dog options here.  Tot-Chos ($5.25) - Tots topped with beer cheese, chili, shredded cheddar cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos and sour cream. This was a good sized portion and worth every penny. The tots were perfectly crisp and everything tasted so good together. I'd come back just for these. My hubby had some and really like them too, even the fresh sliced halved tomatoes they added which he'd normally turn away from.   There's a Teeny Weenie Kids Menu that's reasonably priced. No fountain drinks here it's a cold soda case with a variety of bottled drinks priced at $2.25 each. I'm not sure if it's still going on, but they did have in September a promotion called Weenie Wednesday where they sold hot dogs for $2 each and sometimes they have a special themed hot dog for the month."}

This is not a place to go if you are not into a laid back environment as it is more of a family/friends place. The servers are great and leave you to your meal but the space is so small it is extremely easy to flag them down when you need something.   My only complaint and I always tell the manager is that they used to make their cucumber salad with shredded cucumbers but they have since changed to chopping them.

Out of the 4 of us, 3 (myself included) ordered all-you-can-eat, so they were already getting a decent amount of $ from us. What we didn't appreciate is that EVERY TIME the guy came to our table he would warn us that we HAD to finish EVERYTHING. We charge extra for leftovers, or, We charge extra for uneaten rice, or, I told you we charge extra, right?   The worst part was, if he wasn't at our table warning us, he never stopped staring at us. He would stand at his podium and WATCH us eat. Then he'd go back to his sushi chef and make comments in Japanese. Specifically, he kept his eyes on me and it made me lose my appetite. He seriously made us feel like we were trying to pull some scam; it was ridiculous. Who wants to be stared down and made to feel uncomfortable while they're trying to eat? I've been a server and bartender for 5 years, and I NEVER treated any of my customers (even the deserving ones) the way the server there treated me.

I've tried a little bit of everything on the menu. Rather than talk about each individual thing, I'll just give you the gist. There have only been two places that I have been too where all the fish and seafood from start to finish has been completely fresh. Number 1 is Goyemon. Number 2 is Sushi Bay. All the nigiri was very fresh across the board, no weird off flavors or textures. The rice was very good as well, just the right texture and temperature. I liked all the apps as well, they were simple but well prepared. If you do go there, I would also recommend trying out the Cherry Blossom, a marvel of avocado, crab, and goodness. They also have yaki-udon, which I haven't seen on a lot of AYCE sushi menus, and it tasted good. The only minor complaint was I thought the salmon skin was a bit too chewy for my taste, but nothing to take a star off or anything. The server was nice and attentive, and the sushi chef was friendly.  This place was very suprising. I've recently heard that Goyemon has changed a lot since my last visit, with a major turnover in staff, so this will probably be my go-to AYCE sushi spot in Vegas. Everything across the board was very good. From top to bottom, I can't find any major complaints about this place."}

Atmosphere was cute, decorated with traditional Japanese decor like in Japan, felt comfy. Waitress was really nice and friendly and took our order right away, never asked For anything, all refills kept on coming along with napkins. Hubby and I got the all you can eat which was $23 dinner, and for lunch I believe it's $19, by far the cheapest sushi bar I've been to!   All you can eat menu had a large variety of different kind of sushi, including specialty sushi, baked sushi and deep fried. My absolute favorite was the Sushi Bay roll. It's a must to try that. Also the Super White Tuna so fresh and creamy.   I will most definitely come back for more. Give this place a try, I guarantee you'll leave happy and satisfied and possibly full."}

However, I noticed something really odd with the Fried Scallop. The scallops tasted off and looked like imitation crap meat. When i sent it back, staff confirmed that it was indeed deep fried imitation crab. That is very sheisty to mislead the customers and serve fake food. Makes me question about where else are they cutting corners? Hence 1 start rating."}

Especially impressive were the little things. Rice, so often overlooked, was high quality and done to perfection. The miso soup was homemade, fresh and light. One of the best I've had in years.  Service was very polite, attentive and fast.  Satisfied and impressed, I'll be back for sure when I'm on this side of town.

I live down the street from here and it's always packed so I decided to give it a try.   It's a really small place. Maybe 6 tables and a sushi bar. My husband and I sat at the bar and went with all you can't eat. For dinner it is only $25 a person! Half a roll ranges from $6-$9 so if you're going to eat a decent amount, AYCE is the way to go. That is such a great deal so right away I was thinking this food is going to suck. I'm happy to report it as pleasantly surprised!   The food did not take very long at all, especially since we were at the bar so the sushi chefs just handed the food to us as they made it. I highly recommend anything fried - tempura, sandwich roll, etc. That was by far my favorite. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not the best sushi or freshest I've had, but the price and customer service was excellent."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "I remember the first time I came to this place. 4 years ago I just moved to this side of town and was searching for a decent sushi place. Henderson is littered with sushi places but the good ones never offered AYCE. I understand that but sometimes I'm just in the mood to OD on sushi.   Years ago they was offering a special for that time being of AYCE sushi lunch for $18.95. We took a chance since we didn't find any good AYCE sushi nearby. This place is literally a hole in the wall, being in the vicinity of a grocery store and surrounded by fast food joints such as Taco Bell & Dairy Queen. Don't let that stop you from visiting. What it lacks in trendy decor, they make it up with a good variety of sushi.  I always take and suggest Sushi Bay for guests looking for AYCE sushi. It's not expensive and the variety will make anyone happy. My sister is a diabetic and they offer enough riceless sushi for her and for anyone looking to cut down on carbs. Sushi is never formed with too much rice (like some other AYCE sushi places) and when I mean variety I mean the sushi isn't replaced with 1 ingredient  and is renamed.   I always coming when the rush hour is over for AYCE sushi. If it's too busy you can eat at the bar. I recently ate here for their lunch special too. Their lunch special isn't anything special but is priced for a quick healthy lunch. Some reviews complain about the host/hostess and to be honest perhaps they don't want to talk so much because maybe their english isn't perfect. Who cares though? I'm not paying to talk to them.   Will be coming back in the future just as long as they keep up the good work."}

It's a hole in the wall type place on the corner of Pecos and Warm Springs.  Not very many seating, however, every time I've visited the location, I've always been seated right away.  Because of the small floor, they usually have only one server at a time.  If there are big parties, it can take a while before they come to your table.    We usually get the same thing:  All you can eat for $23.95 per person.  Can I just say how wonderful of an idea that is!!  You get an entire menu, front and back to choose from.  I usually go for the side orders and if any sushi, from the Nigiri section I strongly feel getting your money's worth is important.  I don't ever want to be weighed down by lots of rice.  Here's somethings I love from the menu:  Shrimp Tempura:  batter is light and super crispy.  The dipping sauce is lightly salted and sweet at the same time.  Works well with the shrimp.  Teriyaki chicken:  comes in a cast iron mini skillet sizzling!  It sits on a best of sliced onions and Teriyaki sauce.  Love!  Bacon Wrapped Scallops:  Small little bite sizes of mini scallops and salty bacon.  Yum!  Sweet Amaebi Shrimp nigiri sushi:  Comes with 2 per order, per customer.  The shrimp is sweet.  Works well as a bite sized sushi piece.  This dish is served with the deep fried heads as well.  That was a huge surprise, not into eating shrimp heads so I was kind of grossed out LOL.  Soft Shell Crab:  The whole crab, battered, deep fried and cut into 4 huge pieces.  You can eat the whole crab.  The tangy and lightly spicy dipping sauce really works well.  Fried Gyoza:  Pork filled fried dumpling with a great soy dipping sauce.    Hamachi Nigiri:  Love this white yellowtail sushi option.  Not too much of a fishy taste to it.  Really good!  If you're ever in the area, come down and get your sushi fix on.  Overall, this place is actually pretty good.  I would definitely come back and get the All You Can Eat option!!"}

When they walked out, she blurted something out to the sushi men. Let's just say i know their language pretty well.....n what she said was not nice. I have  gone there a couple times n they actually talk smack a lot about their customers. Some customers seem like they come there a lot based on what i hear from the conversation. What disloyal people?? It made me mad.   I felt uncomfortable the entire time. Maybe i should have gone elsewhere when i first felt the weird vibe when i walked in. Another family walked in and out too during our meal. It was really weird there. I would not go back."}

The chefs weren't even trying it seems, and the place was practically empty. I was a loyal customer for 5+ years, but with so many sushi options in this town there is no reason to settle for poor quality and mediocre service."}

But to to lack of customer service, they are getting only 2. My son ordered a roll, after eating the first piece realized that he did not like it. After pushing it to the side the waitress comes up and says that we have to eat it. I nicely said that my son did not like it. And instead of just taking the lost on 1 cucumber maki roll responds with, well why did you order it then and forced us to eat it.

Because me and my boyfriend love the sushi here. We will not be going back after last nights experience. We go here often, but havent tipped much because of the rude waitress. A few weeks ago we ate here, and my bf had a small sip of my coke. He didn't order coke though and the waitress snapped down his throat telling him he couldn't sip my coke... I understand about non all you can eaters eating all you can eat. I know that is not allowed. But it was a soda... like one dollar soda, and he only had a small sip... She scared us so bad yelling at us. If she would of said nicely. He can't drink your coke that would of been fine... So we were like woah...that was bad.... But we gave it one more shot and ate here again thinking maybe she had a bad day or something.  Well as soon as I sat down. The waitress confronted me yesterday and flat out asked me  Why don't you tip more? I was like woah... I told her the food is great thats not the problem. She said I notice you come here ALOT and don't tip a lot. Then she told me basically I couldn't eat there anymore unless I tipped more. I was like WOW never in my life has that happened anywhere I have ate at. She said and your bf or whatever never tips either. I was like wow so insulting! Then I decided to stay and eat. She was like oh so you decided to stay? I felt horrible!! I stayed and ate and even tipped 7 dollars but  I won't be going back. I am now going to eat at sin city sushi. It is such a shame because we were loyal customers who brought friends often. We were probably most of their business. Oh well...."}

If there was a choice in putting zero stars, that's what I would've put for last nights dinner. I called a head of time to see how much AYCE was for adults and children and whomever answered the phone said $25 for adults, $12 for 10 and up and $6 for 5 year olds.   As soon as we got there, my family of 7 were seated, and then ordered AYCE sushi dinner, so a total of 9 sushi rolls and Tuna Poke salad and few more appetizers for the first round. As soon as the Chef (main) saw what we had ordered he asked the waitress how much did you tell them the price for dinner for AYCE. As soon as she told him, he changed the price. Which was unacceptable, but we decided to stay since we were already there.   As we were waiting, the SF Giants game was on and we asked the Chef if he can change the channel and he says no we don't that with a very rude attitude. Normally I don't take that kind of customer service, but I was hungry and was already there, so we stayed.   As soon as we got our Tuna Poke. I can automatically smell the tuna. Which I'm sure wasn't fresh, just by the smell of it and I've been to almost every sushi bar in Henderson and never smelled and tasted the way Sushi Bay's is. Just as I take a bite of tuna, it was very stringy and tasted horrible. So that didn't work out. Then we got everything else, but we ordered 5 baked tempura sushi rolls which was rock hard almost as if they meant to over cook it to make it that way.   They kept brining sushi we didn't order to our table and also had skipped 3 sushi rolls that we ordered and they said we had them. The first thing I order when I go to a sushi bar is Salmon Skin roll, so I know for sure they didn't make me that. No to mention, they never checked on our table and kept having to ask for water.   At this point, I was already aggravated and not only did this place ruin my dinner, they ruined my ability to try new places. At least I know Island Sushi and Sushi Mon are still there to satisfy my cravings as I've been going to those sushi bars for years. Who ever is reading this, DONT COME HERE. Their fish is never fresh. TRUST ME when I say this. GO TO ISLAND SUSHI or SUSHI MON.   I WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE. EVER."}

I spit that out too.  We ordered steamed shumai and the crazy jalapeño. The shumai appeared to be the same ones you buy in the freezer section of an oriental market. It tastes like it had been in the freezer for years. The crazy jalapeño was unnecessarily huge and packed with a stick of cream cheese and spicy tuna. It was disgusting.

Yes I've gone back here, not because I wanted to, but because I had no choice because my co-workers insisted on coming here since we were on lunch, it was nearby, cheap and of course I was hungry.   Of course that Korean chef was there, the rude one, the tall one, the loud one, the one that stares and talks smack about all his customers. I try not to associate with the help there because by now, I know how they work. All I did was wait for my food and try to get out of there as fast as I can.   First thing we order, is the Poke. Mind you, we went there on a Thur and I guess that's when most fish arrive fresh that same day and the poke was smelly and stringy. Then I ask for Salmon Skin Roll w/ less rice and that tall Korean not Japanese Chef says NO, they cannot do that since it's a part of the sushi and how they make it. I tell him, oh you mean you wanna get your customers full from all the rice you put so they don't order anymore sushi? Then it's obvious he's taking smack about me to his people. I've gone to plenty of sushi bars that always did that for me and anyone else whom asked for it. Had to ask for water and napkins countless times. Handed the lady my Debit and walked out.   Of course I find out that I left my Debit card there, so I called there and I said I left my Debit card there and the lady who answered (CHRISTINE) if that's her real name, said yes it's here come pick it up, then hung up the phone before I can even ask any questions. So I called back and asked her why the hell did she hang up on me? she say's I'm very busy and have no time to talk on the phone if it's not regarding any orders. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS??? I asked for her name and she hesitated and asked why? finally she said her name was Christine. LOL I'm sure it's not real. THIS PLACE IS A CIRCUS.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "FOR THOSE THAT LIKE SALMON FLAVORED CHEWING GUM... I've had Krab with a K before but not Phish with a Ph (as in PHOOEY!) A group of friends and I went to The Ka on a Wednesday night and they were closed for construction so we Yelped for an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi (AYCES) place near by. Here is a prime example as to why you cant rely on a Four Star rating when there are only seven ratings. Of the ratings, three were from locals, four from visitors. We Vegas locals take the AYCES trend for granted, but most major cities don't have a lot of AYCES places. When a FOUR STAR review starts like this:  7 words...  All-you-can-eat-sushi-to-order! Wow.  Not the best sushi I have ever eaten but when it's all you can eat for $21.95, what can you really complain about?  can you really rely on a review like that? NOT ME! I can excuse the visitors that are enchanted by their first AYCES experience (And who can't? It's like the time you popped your cousin's cherry at church camp!), but I've got seven words for that reviewer: Glutton! It's all about the raw fish!   But it's the locals and those that call this the best in Vegas and high quality that leave me speechless. For the woman who has been going to this joint for three years (THREE YEARS!!!) here's a bit of advice: Get a date, have him take you out to another respectable AYCES place like The Ka, Sushi Mon, or I Love Sushi, and DISCOVER THERE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE. Good God, it's like a Mormon who has his first Silver Bullet and thinks he's found the Nectar of the Gods. WALK THE TWO MILES TO THE KA and discover fishy yumminess. You could use the walk after eating so damn much!  Look, there are literally over 100 AYCES joints in Las Vegas, and they range between $21.95 and $27.95. There are some decent places in the $21.95 range, but hell, it's SUSHI, pay the extra few dollars and go to a GREAT PLACE LIKE THE KA!  The ambiance was the same minimum standard in the valley. It's a good thing I didn't come to eat the decor, because there wasn't any to look at, let alone eat. The sushi bar had 7 stools and they could seat another 30, maybe. At least the place was clean.  But let's get down to the REAL reason we are here: TO CONSUME A TON OF RAW FISH. Why else are you going to get so excited to eat at an endless trough for $21.95? If you want to just stuff your gullet, go to one of the Station Casinos' Feast Buffet for 2/3 the price and roll yourself home. WE ARE HERE FOR THE FISH, BABY!  Well, at least, that is why I WENT there, but I won't be going back there for the fish. My #1 marker for a good sushi joint is the Salmon, and my girlfriend (former LA food critic) goes by the Yellowtail. While the Yellowtail was passable (but still not good), the SALMON SUCKED. Wrigley's makes a much tastier chewing gum and it ain't $21.95, either. You know how good salmon looks, that beautiful orange color with as little of the white marbling as possible? Well, apparently they don't at Sushi Bay. Not only was it heavily marbled which made it less than favorable texture, but it had a lot of that brown stuff which is too close to the skin and is just out-right chewy. BLECH. Sadly, it didn't even have that good salmon taste. It was very bland and watery. And they are STRICT and annoying as hell constantly telling you (maybe even threatening you) that they'll charge you for anything you don't eat, so I got stuck eating 10 pieces of bad salmon. Grrrr.   The menu has a good variety of rolls, but that's typical for almost every sushi place in Vegas these days. The rice was mushy and they use WAY TOO MUCH RICE in the rolls. Only a few were passable. I never get Lobster Rolls in anything but the very expensive joints because THINK ABOUT IT: do you think they can afford to give you GOOD lobster roll for anything less than $20 a roll? Hell no, most places are using the lowest quality lobster just so they can say they have one. And no surprise here at Sushi Bay, it sucked. And of course they are going to suck, as the quality of the fish is rotten. Even the seaweed in the miso soup was chewy, not the light, delicate stuff found in good sushi joints.  Look, you don't have to take my word for it. There are six other people who recommend this place. If you've read my review and the others and you still want to check it out, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to do so. And then come back here and mea culpa and we can go to The Ka together and have some REALLY GOOD SUSHI THERE.  Now, bring me a bucket!"}

The miso was good, just a bit high of a price for such a small amount. The fried calamari didn't take take long to stink up inside my car. If calamari is done correctly it has little to no fishy smell and I live less than 2 miles from this place. I think the (very polite and friendly) waitress gave me the wrong sauce for my tempura. She gave me an extremely oily and spicy dip. Just double check the sauces they give you before you leave.   On to the roll...Honestly, what is it about LV and their unusually small sushi rolls? I have been now to 3 sushi spots of varying price and all small! These rolls were teeny tiny. The quality of the roll didn't impress me either. Note: They do use a good balance of rice to filling ratio but I was definitely still hungry after that.   If anyone knows of a sushi spot around where the rolls are larger than a quarter than please send the info my way!!  At the end of it I paid $15 to still be hungry, and eat fishy calamari  As much as I love a local small chain sushi spot I will not be back. On to the next spot!"}

When finally getting some form of service, we asked for water, and the girl disappeared for another fifteen minutes.  A party of two who came after us were seated, serviced, and had food before us.   At this point an hour has gone by without us every being asked what we would like to eat, so we left.  The sad part is the main chef kept looking at us and knew we weren't being serviced. It's only my second time, but my brother and his family have been going here for several years. We walked out after another twenty minutes of not being greeted at the table. Terrible customer service."}

The quality, portions and service has declined gradually over the past few years.   The visit before this one should have been my warning. I fell extremely ill after having dinner there with my brother.  I decided to give it another try today and was disappointed yet again.   The salmon skin roll was so tough - almost jerky like that I had to swallow the pieces whole (They charge you for leftovers).   The tuna poke portions slowly decreased over the years but has been so tasty that it didn't matter too much. They must have gotten a few complaints because they added bagged mixed lettuce to the poke to make it seem like a larger portion.   I was so hungry that I decided to stick with cooked foods and they couldn't even get that right.   I've never been a race girl but I kinda took it there when it was completely OBVIOUS that they were treating everyone else different (better)  than me. The waitress went around 4 different times filling water and never filled my glass. The portions of food were larger at everyone else's table and not mine. I'm hoping it wasn't a race issue because we have enough of that going on in society.   At this point (because it really hurts me to give this review) I've decided to declare this as an off day. I'm not sure if I'll visit again because they've been so inconsistent. I really hope they get it together because their good days were truly amazing!!"}

We were the only ones in there for quit some time, so when we ordered they didn't have any sense of time spacing, they just made everything at once and threw it at us and the table wasn't big enough for what we wanted to try!.  the bacon wrapped shrimp potion was comical... take a look at the picture... the picture makes the plate look huge but that thing was not more then 3x3  The tornado roll was good though, however the lobster roll was a joke, the only reason I ordered it was because of the picture, either they play favorites to regulars or they completely became stingy with how they make their stuff..   the search for the best AYCE sushi place in henderson continues! as I don't think i'd be putting this one on the top.."}

So yesterday i decide let me do the take-out this time i call it in so i can pick it up so they aren't so rude but they messed that up too. I saw an order sitting bagged up as soon as i get there, they have me wait and pay i waited 10min i told them i have a service dog in the car i need to go, then the buss boy comes to the hostess and says this is her food. so i got cold food an attitude from the hostess.

Half way through dinner I started feeling nauseous and slowly lost my appetite. I had at least half of my steak, but then felt like I hit a wall and was done.  Don't get me wrong, the steak was perfectly cooked, but it seemed like everything I ate was super salty!   It wasn't until the next morning I felt really sick. I'm not talking 'bout hangover sick (because I didn't have any alchie bevies at dinner) but this was a different kinda sick that I wasn't familiar with before.

Only to be ignored at our table for ten minutes before a drink order was taken. We should have left, but we had invested so much time already. The online menu wasn't current and the entrée she wanted wasn't available. A similar item was $3 more. Totally parched we finally received our drinks. The diet was flat. The iced tea was served with a rotting lemon. Then, later her entrée, came with a rotten potato. They switched it out, but obviously rotten food shouldn't be prepared, let alone leave the kitchen. Cheese, bacon and butter was requested with the potato, and the cheese was some sort of liquid. Ew. The rest of our meal was edible, but underwhelming and overpriced.

I've been here about 4 times and every sushi dish and roll I've ordered has been very good to excellent. The not so good news: So far every dish Ive had not sushi related has been mediocre to poor. Once I had a noodle dish that was obviously made the day before and reheated. It was sticky, clumped together and tasteless. Tonight I had a fired won ton appitaizer. At first glance it looked nice, but then I noticed the lettuce it was served on was wilted and brown. If the won tons were good I won't not have cared, but they were so bad I couldn't eat them. The cream cheese inside was cold and pasty while the won ton themselves were tough as shoe leather. Again obviously made the day before and heated up and served. This place has so much potential, but the corners they are cutting is going to make people stop coming here. I may come again for the sushi, but Ill never order anything else here."}

We read about the hibachi and family style menu and wanted to do family style since there were 7 of us (all adults). We were greeted very quickly, we opted for a table since they didn't have any hibachi open at the time for 7 people, it wasn't too crowded but there were a few people. We were seated in the sitting area and our waitress AUDREY came to get drink orders. Tried to sneak in a question but ignored me and left. Came back with drinks and asked if we were ready to order, when I said I had a question about family style since that is what we were interested in, she didn't even let me finish as she rudely spoke over me and said we don't do that, then I showed her on the menu where is said family style online and she said that they didn't do that we all had to order indivisdually and then share (that's completely fine portions are huge, I just wished she would have explained it or atleast let us ask questions without being bothered). She then brought out the soups, rather than giving each person one she just told the person at the end. Pass them down again with a huge attitude. Same thing with the salad. After she started bringing out the entreees we saw it was a lot and wanted to cancel one of the sides (vegetable fried rice) she said we couldn't do that since the order was already placed again with the attitude. We ate and tried to make the most of our time after all my family came in from California and Arizona for my bday and we were less than thrilled with our service.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "The wait was 15 minutes long..... we waited with no problem.  We were seated and later greeted by our waitress.  I asked for water with lemon, and a spicy cilantro margarita. My guy ordered a Stella.  Our drinks took at least ten minutes to come.  The margarita was awesome.... Worth the wait. Possibly the best margarita that I have ever had. However, the Stella was lacking a little...and not as cold as it should have been.  One thing that really WOW'd me, was that they have a baby plate.  That I had never seen before, or heard of at any other restaurant.  And it's complimentary!   It comes to the table, covered in saran wrap,  with a stick of cheddar cheese, a slice of turkey, apple sauce, and mini orange slices.   Gourmet, no. But very thoughtful. It kept her busy.  We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza as an appetizer, along with the shrimp with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and slathered in BBQ sauce.  The pizza comes out, and it is the wrong size. That gets sent back. The shrimp were quite good. I would have liked more cream cheese, and they could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce.   My water was almost gone... Our waitress walked by us at least four times, and didn't refill it.  oh, and did I mention that I was the only one at the table that got water.......?   When customers are drinking, aren't you suppose to supply water..? Or do these people not watch Bar Rescue.?  One water between the two of us was kind of lame. Between our waitress and the supervisor, they both said that they were getting our drinks 3 different times...   Geez. THANK GOD IS WASN'T SUMMER.  We both ordered another round. My margarita was again, awesome. However, the Stella this time was flat and gross.. The supervisor took it away.  The right size pizza comes out, and we munch on that. It was good, like better than Metro Pizza good. Happy with that.   Still waiting for water refills.  I ordered the Frisco burger, on grilled sourdough, with thousand island and fires. My guy ordered the beef ribs with fried Mac and cheese.  When our food finally arrives, I take a bite. Salty. I take a drink of my water (waiting for ice cubes to melt, at this point). I take a second bite to make sure that I'm not too loopy.... Still salty. I pass it off to my guy (who loves salt) to try it. He thinks it's salty too.   UGH. The fries were good though. Best fries ever. A bite is taken out of the fried mac and cheese, and it's not hot.  I finally am able to flag down our waitress, and we let her know about the unsatisfying food. We take dessert (red velvet cupcakes) to go.  This was probably the longest dinner experience I have ever had in my life.  The check comes, and even with my over salty burger and the flat, warm beer taken off, our bill is $93.   Yes, $93. My guy thought I was joking.  Red velvet cupcakes are Ok. Nothing Bundt Cakes has waayy better Red Velvet.  Stick to just drinks and appetizers here. Nothing else is worth it."}

For our main course, I had ordered the country fried steak and a house salad. The steak was cooked well, but it had a bit too much breading on it. My fiancé ordered the ribeye with a house salad- they were made very sloppy. Her ribeye was cooked as she ordered (medium rare). The food was all cooked very well, and I felt that it was totally worth the money.   My problem I had here was the atmosphere. The restaurant was full of people who lacked manners and courtesy.

Compared to a similar dish at Chili's (Cajun Chicken Pasta), with a full chicken piece is on top of the pasta with thick cuts, CJ's was definitely inferior.

The service has always been quite stellar, our server was always pretty great. The food, I would have to say is very good EVERY TIME.  Always up to a high standard.    Today, however, was a whole 'nother experience. We came in with a party of 8 (technically we asked for a table for 7, plus a high chair for my baby nephew) and we asked if their happy hour was still going on.  We were informed that it was and it was a self-serve area by the bar.  So we just put two tables together and no biggie.  When we walked in the waitress, Olivia, assisted in putting together the tables.  Keep in mind, we only came in here because Cheesecake Factory had a long wait time and we wanted some desserts ONLY. Also, we came in a whole HOUR before the place closed.  Nevertheless, we sat down and we became interested in their happy hour menu which was advertised, not only in their website,  but also all over their tables.  So we decided to add some appetizers to our order.  After ordering, we were informed that the Happy Hour prices are no longer valid, despite the fact that it's clearly stated on ALL their tables and we got a happy hour menu.  She said they just changed the policy that day.  And that the advertised Happy Hour is only valid during the REGULAR Football Season.  Is she stupid?  The REGULAR season is not over until the SUPER BOWL!!!! Uhm, OKAY.  So we placed our orders still and I went to check with the hostess, she got the manager and I spoke to her and she informed us that she will honor the happy hour prices.    Once we got our order, my sister accidentally spilled a bit of blue cheese in her coffee.  When I asked the waitress for a new cup, she ignored me.  When I asked for an extra bread for my nephew, who wanted more bread, she looked at me with an incredulous expression and paused to say, uhm, yeah...okay.  She comes back to refill my coffee (without any spoons distributed to us, AT ALL) and proceeded to refill my sister's drink SEEING that there's white stuff floating all over it.  This whole time, she would go back forth to the bar and whisper with the bartender and they would roll their eyes.    As she poured that coffee, I was astounded at her stupidity and her laziness.  I was just staring at her hoping she would notice and it would click that she should get a new cup.  NOTHING! She avoided eye contact with me and had this stupid smirk on her face like she's mocking us.  WHAT THE HELL!? I understand that she may be having a bad day, but proper customer service should still be practiced to keep professionalism intact.  Unfortunately, she had neither professionalism nor proper customer service etiquette.  I once again asked for the Manager and she could not even do anything but serve us the remainder of our order, in which time, my sister walked out because she couldn't take it anymore.  I have seen a lot of bad customer service in my time, but this has got to be the worst I have ever seen.  She should not be a waitress if she does not like having to wait on others.  It's absurd! It's insulting! And most importantly, it's unacceptable!! This will definitely not be the end of it.  We're great tippers as people who has worked previously in the service industry.  We know the value of a good service and we pay good money when we receive it.  But that service that we received did not even warrant a single penny.  They're lucky my brother in law is still very generous and still left a tip.  I cannot  believe that experience.    For a company that is under Landry's Inc., who claim that they are the leader in Dining and Hospitality, this kind of service is truly unacceptable.  It's abhorrent and just plain idiocy to have those kinds of servers employed at such a facility.  I will not go back to this location EVER.  Lastly, the hostess, provided better customer service and professionalism that the manager and the two servers we came across during this visit.  WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! They totally ruined my sister's 17 years anniversary with her husband!"}

The restaurant was  nice and looked well organized . I sat at the teppanyaki table and placed my order with the friendly waitress. I ordered the NY steak which came with soup, salad , vegetables and fried rice. I waited patiently for the grill to warm up so that the chef could start cooking, I didn't really need the frills and thrills of the teppanyaki show ( which was great btw) I just wanted to taste the food. Now , I'm not sure if it was because I was the only one at the table and the chefs are used to making larger portions of the fried rice, but my rice was super salty. Moving on to the meat which I ordered medium well and ended up being medium and was tasteless , I tried dipping it in the sauce the chef gave me but those didn't taste so good. Now to my beloved vegetables, they were bitter as if the garlic had been burnt .

Yesterday we decided to give them another try so we arrive at the hostess booth. She tells us there will be a 20 minute wait. I don't mind waiting if the place is busy but you can clearly see from the entrance that there is almost nobody in there and plenty of empty tables. So I inquired and was told by the hostess that they do not have enough servers.  I don't think that I should spent my evening waiting for a table because management does not know how to schedule, so we left. This was the final straw for me and we will avoid this Claim Jumper location entirely from here on out."}

I have spent a lot of memories there and I don't think they are that busy to throw some food with the rest of the food they are cooking isn't that what the chef is paid to do and went to hibachi school for. I feel I should of been treated better. I have had a $25 sea bass burnt and that is why I requested because I new it would be cooked right!"}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I have to start with a disclaimer. Among the chain restaurants, I am partial to Claim Jumper ( you can look at my reviews of their restaurants in Town Square and Downtown Vegas which were positive). We were coming from the movies at Green Valley Ranch with friends and thought we would have an informal, after the movie, dinner at the nearby Claim Jumper. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there. We got seated right away and our server came to the table immediately taking our drink orders and bringing the oversized croissant bread plate for the table. The bread was the highlight of the meal. When at Claim Jumper, I usually get one of their salads and my wife usually gets a simple hamburger (bun, burger,  bun). I wanted to try something different, so I ordered their jambalaya. Our friends ordered salad and a burger. My jambalaya came first. Few minutes later, the burgers came. And then the salad. My friend took one bite out of his burger and we had to start looking for the server to send it back. He found it so over salted that it was virtually not edible. My wife wanted her burger medium rare with nothing on it. It came medium well with lots of lettuce and tomato. The server said it must have been someone else's burger. My friends wife also had to return her salad. As to the jambalaya, it was a good sized portion of what looked like a plate of linguine with 6 shrimp on the perimeter. I did find two small pieces of what looked like luncheon meat chicken mixed in with the pasta. There was absolutely no sausage. There were no vegetables that I could find. In my experience, jambalaya should have some kick to it. This was absolutely bland. I can't say that the dish was bad. But it certainly wasn't good. And it certainly wasn't anything that I would call jambalaya. They did make good on my friend's burger as well as my wife's burger. But they were brought to the table separately much later,  well after I had finished my meal. The salad came back even later than that. So while we all sat at the same table, we ate our meals separately. At the end of the meal, someone who I believe was a manager came to the table with the standard so how was everything? frankly, she should have known and come to the table with an apology. The bottom line for me: 1. When at Claim Jumper,  stick with ordering the salads, they do a good job with them in general. 2. Don't eat at the Green Valley Claim Jumper. Stick with town square and downtown. Those kitchens seem to work well. The Green Valley outlet, not so much."}

It took a little over an hour for our food to arrive, and 2 of the 7 dishes were ice cold. The cashier did remove the items from our bill, which was nice. I don't want to be completely negative, so I will say I ordered the mini chicken artichoke pizza which was extremely tasty. Claim Jumper is fine.. chain food, huge portions.

Arrived about 8:30 it was pretty quiet and dark  inside. There was no wait which kind of made me wonder why on a Friday night. Walking past the food prep area two of the wait staff were laughing loudly after one dropped an F bomb in front of us. We were seated and we had a nice quiet meal that was on par with Denny's for a premium price. My salad was good other than they make croutons out of sweet corn bread. The combination of Blue Cheese dressing and yellow cake croutons was just wrong.  I ordered fish and chips because it's hard to mess that up. Wrong again. Over cooked fish jerky fried in rancid oil. All on a huge pile of soggy french fries. My wife got grilled shrimp and fillet Mignon. A different  waiter brought her plate and announced here's your sirloin and shrimp. He was told we ordered Fillet Mignon and grilled shrimp not Sirloin and Fried shrimp. He said Oh I think it's the same thing. No sirloin and fillet Mignon is not the same thing. He took the plate back to the kitchen. Our waiter came back and said whats the problem? We told her and she went to the kitchen and brought the same plate back with a side of grilled shrimp. I seated facing the kitchen and could see that her plate had not moved from when it was taken back. Now it had been sitting back there and was cold. Well we left knowing why it was nearly empty on a Friday night."}

At 3pm, I called and made a reservation for a party of 7 people at 7:30pm, then at 5:30pm I called again and said if I could change the reservation time to be sooner. I was told that YES. We arrived there at 6:35pm and was confirmed by the MANAGER that he doesn't have a table for me at that time, but would try to get a table for us in 10 min. While we were waiting, the other waitress told us that there was a table should be finished soon. 20 min has passed. We came back inside and realized that that table was taken by another party. We asked and that MANAGER told me that sorry but I gotta wait another 30 min. He said that: i try my best to get the table for you, but because you called today to make reservation, while others had made reservations yesterday WOW, really????? If it's full, why did you accept the reservation?? Because you are greedy????? I really need a better explanation of how we are treated like that. I wanna say sorry to the owner if I had said the bad words in the restaurant, but sorry I couldn't hold myself anymore. I couldn't ever imagine I was treated like that. We didn't come to eat for free. We deserve a better treat. Also, when I told him that if you wanted us to wait another 30min, why didn't he tell us at first? And why the other waitress told us that we could get the table in 10'. His answer was:  they don't know anything, they don't have the right to coordinate the table. My little 11-year-old cousin responded:  so why did you hire her if she doesn't know anything. In short, don't come to this replace if you don't wanna feet refused for the service.

Given we had a group of 25, I had fairly low expectations for the service, but they did an excellent job! From the time we sat down to the time we left it was just over two hours, which I think is pretty decent with a group that size!   Now beware, the menu is huge. Pages on pages! I had my mind made up three different times and finally when put under some pressure, made a decision. I settled on the Frisco Burger and fries, a swiss cheese burger with thousand island dressing served on grilled parmesan sourdough (like toast, not a bun). It was tasty but nothing special. I actually wish it were served on a bun. If I were to describe my eating pace, I'd say its fairly normal (if I'm not lying, a little quicker than the average) and the bread quickly became soggy. The fries were also nothing special, thinly cut with a good crunch. Again, nothing wrong with the food but I could get a similar burger under ten bucks elsewhere.   Overall, everyone in the group seemed content and no problems arose, but I think this is a one and done experience for me."}

It was weird. Then once he was finishing up cooking the server was seating another family at another hibachi table and I could see him being visibly very disgruntled mouthing and using tons of hands motions to the server. He finally gave up and rolled his eyes, I'm sure because he saw me watching him he explained he was so annoyed and so sick of servers not filling the small tables first because then he has to clean the larger tables.

I asked for it to be medium rare and what came out was a 4-5 oz fish portion with a smattering of crab.  What a sad dish.    I have become more vocal of not accepting half the dish I ordered since I am certainly paying full price for it.  So I told the server my disappointment.  She sent the manager and he came over to ask if I would like anything else.  Mind you my companions are halfway through their meals already.  So I ordered the shrimp fresca.  I should have known from the previous event that it will absolutely NOT look like the picture but I took a chance.  Disappointment once again seized the chance to show me he was king!    You would think that the server would realize that I was disappointed in my dish since I refused to take the rest of it home.

The salads were brought out to our table and the citrus was good size mine was 1/2 the size of theres, when I asked about the difference to the server she said she would check at that time someone from the kitchen came back ,who never identified himself and said that was the full size!I said take it back I'm not paying that much for a cup of lettuce.  The server stopped by and said she would get a manager ,we watched her talk to two managers and neither one stopped by our table ! As we left I stopped up front to get a number to call and they got the gm,I told him the story and his solution was to give me something to go!

Every egg he broke had egg shell in it and he mixed it into the fried rice. Then he kept adding oil, oil, and more oil. No season at all. The rice was brown but only from over cooking it and burning all the oil in it. When I took a bite it tasted of oil and I was so pleased to get some broken egg shell. I set the bowl right back in the grill and said something to the cook. I got no answer. On to the shrimp. I got 5 pieces of shrimp in my meal.?and it was loaded down with oil. Thank good ness for the sauce on the side. It took away some of the oil taste. Buy wait, I didn't get any vegetables when the other did. When I said something he asked for some vegetables from the back. Again drilling with oil and even after I asked him not to use so much. So my 5 pieces of shrimp cost me $19.00. Almost $4 a shrimp. Expensive dinner. I didn't eat the rice or vegetables. Not one person in that resteraunt asked about the meal or why I left the food there.  I don't recommend this place anymore.

But I went ahead & ordered my favorite thing on the menu...the Cashew Chicken Salad Sandwich.  When it arrived, it was HALF the size it normally is.  I soon discovered why!  The wonderful slaw/lettuce mix they had always used & added so much to the sandwich, was now changed to crappy & plain ole lettuce.  I was NOT happy in the least.  Fast forward to lunch today when I took my other half of the sandwich for left overs.  Imagine my shock when I bit down on a chicken BONE!!!  It freakin broke my molar tooth.  Then I found 2 more hard white bone grisle pieces that had been mixed into the Chicken Salad Mixture.  I just sent the Corporate office a nasty gram via email.  I had BETTER hear back from someone.  I do have to say, the waiter (cant remember his name) was really great & explained that corporate just made all these changes to bring Claim Jumper out of the 1980's.  Apparently, Claim Jumper was just purchased by some other corporation & decided to change things.  I will NOT return to the Green Valley Parkway location ever again.  I normally go to the Summerlin location.  I may never return at all.  It is such a shame because Claim Jumper has always been one of my favorite places to eat.  I do have to say, the new onion rings were delicious.  I guess they had been previously frozen like the fried zucchini.  Now they are hand battered & made fresh.  That was the only good change corporate has made.  If it wasn't broke, why fix it???"}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Here's the deal: I have not been a big fan of this restaurant for a long time. Primarily because it just never struck me as something special and it really isn't. I always remember the food as being just a shrug. Nothing bad, but nothing great either. However, I have been visiting their restaurants lately per request of family and these recent experiences have changed my view of this brand and their food.  The last time I dined here, I decided to take a different route and go with a steak. I ordered their Ribeye Steak: hand-cut, boneless USDA Choice, 12oz  ($24.29) with Salt & Pepper Shoestring Fries. To my surprise, the meat was delicious. Tender, grilled perfectly to medium rare, and most importantly, tasty. I was floored. I have spent more money on less steak to have it cooked improperly! I was ecstatic. The fries were unbelievably salty though. It was okay though because I was just so happy about my steak. I also tried some of my fiance's Chicken Pot Pie ($13.29) and I couldn't believe it was better than the one I had at Grand Lux Cafe in September!  We also visited this past Thanksgiving with my fiance's parents. I selected the roasted turkey with gravy, stuffing, cranberry relish, baked potato with butter and chives, and roasted vegetables. Again, delicious! The turkey was surprisingly moist, gravy was tasty, the stuffing was also moist, the relish was sweet and added texture to compliment everything else really well, and the carrots, zucchini, red onions, and yellow squash were roasted perfectly! It was truly a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and very, very filling. The apple pie and pumpkin pie offered with the dinner were just okay. Oh, we were also served gigantic dinner rolls were so delicious.  Although Claim Jumper won't be one of my first choices for dining out, I can say that I am truly pleased with the food and wouldn't mind returning. I had a hard time deciding on 3 or 4 stars since the food has definitely been a four-star experience, however, the service and over dining experience would warrant three stars (our server couldn't remember anything - our orders, that there was a child in our party, if we paid our bill, etc - it was odd)."}

The Chili inside - STONE COLD.  Like someone opened a can of .89 cents Chili from a shelf and and simply spooned it in.  The menu indicated it would be topped with Cheddar Cheese, 3 small shreds of cheese. I tried 2 spoonfuls, the meal (if that's what Claim Jumper calls a meal), was sent back 98% untouched.

The Gyoza were under-cooked. The fried rice was basically rice with egg and a little scallion and lots of minced garlic.  The vegetables were properly cooked but bland, with the primary taste being the onions.  The NY steak was properly cooked, but a mix of chewy and parts that were tender.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "For starters I would like to say that we did not eat at the Hibachi table we ate in regular dining. I have also lived in Japan for 4 years and know my Japanese food.    Just to let you know before you read.  This place is not an actual Japanese restaurant, at least when it comes to the regular dining.  They have Japanese dishes, but it more Chinese and Korean if anything. Most of the people I saw working there were Chinese. I did not see a single Japanese person which had me concerned about the food in the beginning.  For starters when we walked and was asked if we would like Hibachi or regular dining.  I said Hibachi, then the waiter left for a quick moment and came back with the manager.  The manager (older Chinese lady) said while walking to us no you can't sit in at the Hibachi table. I felt very disrespected at the tone of her voice. I asked her how long the wait would be she said 40 minutes.  I said regular dining was fine then.  We sat down and the service from then on was fine.  Now on to the food, We ordered Gyoza and Yakitori chicken for appetizers and my daughter (5yrs old) wanted the Shrimp Tempura Udon.  The Gyoza was deep fried which is fine, but had very little taste.  The Yakitori was 3 pieces of white meat chicken (it didn't specify it was white meat on the menu) on stick x3 and it was slightly dry and and no taste even with the sauce on it.  For a Japanese restaurant to serve white meat Yakitori is hard to find. Typically in Japanese culture it is dark meat chicken.  The Shrimp Tempura Udon The Shrimp comes on the side which the waitress told us.  The Shrimp Tempura was okay nothing to brag about.  The Udon noodles were overcooked and way too soft.  The Broth was very sweet, not salty or any meat taste for a Japanese broth.  When my I take my daughter to eat she eats all her noodles. She ate 4 bites and said she didn't want anymore. which has never happened.   I ordered the combination Yakisoba and White Tiger Sushi Roll. The Yakisoba came out and I saw instantly that the noodles used were chow mien noodles (a medium fat noodles) not actual a noodles used in Japanese Yakisoba (a skinny type noodle).  The Yakisoba was very sweet like the Shrimp Tempura Udon.  I couldn't finish it and asked the waitress to take it away.  They did take it off the bill and asked if I wanted something else I told them no.  The White Tiger Roll was very small.  The roll was about 3/4 an inch High maybe.  I was very disappointed in the size of the rolls.  The fish was not fresh and they used a lot of spice to try and cover it up.  Overall I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I had to return part of my meal because the only thing Japanese about the dining area was the names on the menu.  Some things are priced too high for what they are, and the food was not good at all. The best thing I had, was the water."}

He still had the grill on cooking vegetables and he couldn't even bother to get some more fresh shrimp to cook up for him but instead he cut up the few pieces of shrimp he set aside on the grill to save for after so that he can toss it into people's mouths. He served those 4 pieces of shrimp to my 4 yr old son he forgot to serve, after it's been sitting on the grill. He did not even apologize and the manager seemed like he could care less. They did take off our son's meal off our bill but that is not the point. He could've handled that better.

O and MG, no one stopped by our table for about 20 minutes, so we gave up and went to sit at the bar. Things did improve after that, luckily! We got our drinks pretty quick and were finally able to order. We had 2 appetizers- the spinach/artichoke dip and breaded lemon pepper zucchini. The zucchini was delicious, and the dip not so much. It was not hot and needed more flavor. My meal of simply grilled mahi was pretty good, although the sauce could've been tastier. My dining partner really enjoyed the steak and shrimp entree.

I try to stay away from them but after debating where to eat for 15 minutes we just decided to pull over and eat here. The service here was actually very good our server and busboy were very attentive and friendly. We usually avoid appetizers because we always leave so full and that was definitely the case here that night. Our entrees came with choice of soup or salad. I chose chicken tortilla and the babe had clam chowder. The winner was the chowder. Very good. Mine was good too but not equally delicious. The babe had beef ribs and I had beef tips with mushrooms atop mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. Can't remember the name of the dish. The beef ribs were huge. They could have been more tender but we really enjoyed them. I wasn't a fan of my dish too much because it had so much Rosemary in the sauce but the beef was very tender and the veggies were really good. The service was great and I liked the log cabin decor inside. Made it very cozy. I would definitely come back when in the mood for comfort food the ambiance is nice and the service even better. Just Make sure u come hungry because portions are huge. I took home more than half my meal!"}

We sat in the main dining, not hibachi, and the restaurant was nearly empty. Once seated, it took our waitress 15 minutes to come to the table and take our drink order. Another 15 minutes later, drinks were delivered and food order was taken. It was still another 30 minutes before we got food (not what we are used to based on our experiences at the Decatur/Blue Diamond location).  We are dining on the hibachi side tonight, so I'm hoping our experience is better."}

And the fried rice is too dry, you can feel the dryness cause its hard to swallow, i saw the other people who sat at the same table cant finish the protein and the fried rice. I wish the owner pay more attention about the chef, the way Jason cook describe how poor the quality of  maintain the food for the customer!! One star is just for the ambience (they played 2105 pop music) I Dont think it will last longer if the owner still dont care about how the chef cook and let the chef work as what easy for them,Keep doing like this and it will closed down like the previous restaurant named Pumi."}

The host suggested we eat in bar for faster service.  Since it was such a beautiful day out we decided to eat outside.    The service was extremely SLOW!! I felt that we were forgotten about, when I finally received my Burger it had paper in it, apparently they did not take the paper off the cheese and I ate part of it.  The server told me it was ok because it was just paper, she grabbed a manager who told me the same thing.  I argued that it was not ok, no one should eat paper!    The manager told me she would replace it with soup or a salad, I told her forget it I was only on lunch and I would stop somewhere on the way back to work to get a burger at a fast food place, my friend said no they can just make you another one  and the manager just looked at us....she was not prepared I guess to give us another burger?!  Weird.....she disappeared for about 15 minutes, but we could see her walking around in the bar area, when she came back out she actually lied and said she cooked it herself....kind of difficult to make a burger in the kitchen when you are in the bar!"}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I used to love Claim Jumper and rarely ever got to go as a kid.  It was too far from home for a regular dinner outting.  Then I moved to Las Vegas and just sort of forgot about them.  Just the other night, though, my family visiting from California recommended we go.    It was a bit different than I remember.  The food is still, for the most part, enormous.  It is what they are known for.  My step mom ordered fried chicken.  It looked my like a turkey filling up the plate the way it did.  The only food of disappointing size on this occassion was the dinner salad we all ordered.  It was a bit skimpy and sort of soggy even though we all ordered different dressing.  I don't remember the bread with tomato dipping sauce being brought to the table before.  It was alright but sort of forgettable.  It was fluffy which was nice.  But the sauce on top and the sauce on the side were bland.  I had a piece with and a piece without the sauce and could hardly tell the difference.  I'll pass.  There were also some items I don't remember seeing on the menu previously.  And even a few I remember that I did not see anymore.  There was no salad bar and we were told it is because we are in Las Vegas and they cannot compete with the casino buffets when it comes to salad bars.  Interesting.  Service the other night was not bad.  Though it is worth noting my grandma ordered fish and chips with no chips but rather a side of fruit instead.  When her meal came, it had fries and no fruit.  We had to ask again for that.  My aunt had to ask for the sweet potato she ordered because it was not brought out either.  Everything else seemed to go off without a hitch.    I had a Widow Maker burger that was crazy good.  It was cooked to a perfect medium the way I like it.  It was topped with onion rings, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato and some sort of relish.  It was difficult to eat because of its size.  But it was also delicious.  I was impressed with that.  What I was disappointed in with my overall meal was my iced tea.  It was weak.  It was more like water with food coloring.  The lemon helped to give at least some contrast to an otherwise tasteless beverage.  I think I have pretty much fallen out of love with Claim Jumper.  It might as well be just another page in my high school year book that I look back on with fond memories.  I am moving on."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "We went Friday the 13th. Maybe that was the wrong idea...I am mainly giving it a 1 star due to the not-so-good service and the expense of the meal not being worth what we received. First off, we made reservations, and glad we did. We walked in and it the waiting area was about 15 people. We walked up, got brought right to our table. I'd have to imagine a lot of people made reservations, as there were a lot of empty seats. We sat down, my friend got the house merlot ($7) and I got a domestic beer ($5.25). We ordered the zucchini sticks. VERY good! a light breading, and ranch dressing. I would recommend these. You get a huge pile of them, so best if there are 3 of you to share since it is an appetizer. They also brought out a big loaf of warm cheddar bread. When salads came, we did not get any cracked pepper. The people behind us did get fresh cracked pepper.  My friend got the blackened bow tie chicken, I got the rack of baby back ribs. The blackened chicken was good, but not fantastic. You can get better pasta at a cheaper price at Pasta Cucina inside Sunset Station Casino.  As for my baby back ribs... I only got 7 bones. There are 13 ribs in pork, granted a couple of ribs may get left off on the shoulder. Basically you are NOT getting a rack. You are getting a half a rack, cut into two sections. I would guess they are taking a section of 3 or 4 that should have been on my plate, and putting it on someone's plate that ordered a half rack. And my supposed rack was $25.99!!! I was told gravy came with my mashed potatoes, it didn't. by the time it came, the mashed potatoes were cold. Now maybe this was a mistake. If it was, the manager can contact me here. I doubt that will happen as I am sure they give everyone a half rack when they order a rack.  Bottom line, we paid about $75 for a dinner that we felt cheated on and that the service left much to be desired. For that price you can go to Carve steakhouse inside Eastside Cannery and get great service, both get the Rib eye or prime rib (both are fantastic) and get out cheaper. But no drinks (hey, you are in a casino, gamble and drink for free).  Just too many good places to eat in vegas and not walk away feeling like you were cheated."}

When it came down to the cooking it went down fast. A lady was vegetarian and kept advising him to not add egg in her rice and to use a separate utensil but he was drunk and kept forgetting. I'm not exaggerating he had like 4 sake bombs just at our table and he had a cup he kept drinking from. One of the other patrons actually commented on it and Jason said it was tea lol sure. But I digress. He was talking so much while making the rice he forgot about the vegetarian no egg in rice and my fiance and I noodles. he didn't even stir them once. he literally threw them on the grill and tossed them our plate a while after. they were dry, over cooked, and tasteless. I was livid as I could see where this was going. Hibachi isn't crazy expensive but it's not cheap either. I expect quality food at that price point. Anyways, I ask him to remake our noodles in a low tone and just so he could here. I wasn't trying to make a big deal but I wanted edible noodles. Well he made 3-4 lippy comments and by 3 or 4 I replied with an even more snippy response. I'm beyond irritated at this point. First he says while making my noodles that usually people tell him how they want their noodles in the beginning. Mind you there noodles expecting them to not be over cooled and have flavor shouldn't be deemed a preference more so a standard(this is what I was thinking but I didn't say it). Second time he puts the raw noodle on my plate and say this is how they come out. third thing, he makes a scene, while placing the noodles on my plate he says no one has ever said anything about . y noodles before and involves another patron at the table who was acknowledged as his friend. and start to pick at me as of I was being difficult. At this point I respond and advise the chef well I'm a regular at another location I know how noodles are suppose to taste and these aren't it. He made a couple more jabs. By the end he ordered like 3 more meats and looked around the table confused about who got what and started piling food on everyone's plate and to finish off the night you guessed it another sake bomb. He was obviously intoxicated. I will never go to this location again. I'm very upset I spent $90 on food I took home and threw away. The only salvageable food was the lobster and that was because I literally walked him through cooking it. I told him when to take it off and how much garlic n butter etc. Overall horrible experience. Maybe well most likely a different chief would have yielded a better experience."}

Then, when we got to the dessert course, the waiter straight-up lied to us and said that it was taking a long time because there was a big rush from the happy hour at the bar, when, in reality, they simply didn't have the dessert we'd ordered. Took almost 30 minutes for the manager to come out and TELL us that, by which time, we were already late for our evening plans.   I so wanted to like this one. Other Claim Jumpers to which I've gone don't have this problem. Front and back of house need a complete overhaul in staffing.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Ok so I'm a huge fan of teppanyaki and this place seemed to come highly rated but I have to say I was slightly disappointed.  We got there on a Friday night with no reservations around 9:00 p.m. Surprisingly we were seated rather immediately.   We were sat with 2 other groups at a standard teppanyaki grill. First thing I noticed was great they try to fit more chairs at each table than is probably comfortable. I'm sure that's maximizing space. And I know it's like that in most places.  Second thing I noticed was the large menu. They do offer a lot of Chinese and Japanese dishes in their regular sit down menu. They have about a third of the restaurant set up for just normal sit down.   Third thing I noticed was how the menus for the teppanyaki was set up. You start off with an $8.95 starter set. Choice of fried rice, brown rice, fried noodles or white rice. Then you get a salad, onion soup (no onions) and grilled vegetable medley.   Then the other proteins are almost like sides and add ons. Everything you'd find in other places. Shrimp, scallops, lobster tail, filet, NY strip, and even Kobe beef for $48.95.  We added the filet for about $10. The chef walked out and started cooking. Asked everyone the basics like confirming orders and the how do you want your meat cooked.  Started off with the vegetable medley. Wasn't too impressed. Mainly broccoli. Something about broccoli on a grill just didn't taste right 2/5.  Second was the fried rice and everyone had and that lacked flavor. 2/5. For as cool as the show was, the flavor was lacking. More like fast food Chinese take out to be honest. Most other places use Gaelic butter. I think that's what's missing.  The soup came out and it had those fried Asian noodles in it that you'd get back in the 80s at Chinese family restaurants. Also lacked flavor 2/5.  Salad was ok. Not the standard ginger dressing but more like a thousand island 3/5.  The chef was good. Had us laughing.   Meat started next. No shrimp appetizer like most places. You can add that on if you want.  My filet was cooked good. I asked for it rare. It came rare. I've the cut a 4:5 but the mustard sauce and the ginger sauce were way too sweet. Couldn't use either for my filet. Ended up salt and peppering my steak.  Overall the place is clean, staff is friendly but I'd rather dish out the extra cash and make a trip out to Benihana."}

This is not the case at Claim Jumper.  We were very disappointed and really felt cheated during this happy hour experience.  We were greeted the moment we sat down by our waiter, Hunter,  who took our drink and food order. We ordered 4 items and our server offered us a loaf of cheese bread while we waited. The apps came quickly but when they came we all 3 looked at each other and said these are not full size appetizers. This was quickly confirmed when neither the zucchini or the artichoke dip looked anything like what was displayed on the happy hour sign at the front door or the picture of the artichoke dip on the happy hour menu itself.  We got 7 zucchini, 4 coconut shrimp and a artichoke dip that was served in a tiny oval ramekin and not in the mini iron skillet in all the happy hour pics.  These were half size apps at half size prices.  When the manager asked if every thing was ok and I asked him about the apps he said these are our happy hour portions and walked away.

We tend to eat in the bar where it's a bit more relaxed.  Just avoid the bar on Friday nights as the Zappos crowd is a bit loud. They are not obnoxious...just loud...and it slows down service a bit.   Menu favorites: all of the salads, potato cheese soup, pretzel sticks, gigantic club sandwich, chicken/mashed potato/cinnamon apple dish (PLEASE BRING BACK THIS DISH WITH PORK!!!)"}

Chassir was right on top of business w/ service, drinks & food.. awesome!    Wish the food was as exceptional cause I would give five stars for both, but rarely the case.  Our mini cheese HH pizza was dripping w/ a pool of grease & I can assure you that even for the $5 HH price, I would not eat it for free.  Hours later we still regretted even eating one slice.  Thankfully we didn't try the mini pepperoni cause I can't imagine the grease on it.      The only worthwhile item on the HH, as I've found out the hard way is the Wedge.  Very fresh & crisp Lettuce & I love balsamic & blue cheese mixed.  The bacon on it & red onion were in perfect portions & I asked for no tomato.    Excellent portion so just take off the Spinach & Artichoke, mini pizzas & add the calamari or something.  I am totally satisfied w/ five stars for the HH Wedge, but it's like hit or miss w/ the other items on HH.  I even got a free item for our bday month in June & was still left disappointed in their food.  You end up spending more on HH to get satisfied or have to complain.  I have eaten off of the regular menu & the best item is the calamari & dessert!  Next time, will have to try that again.  It's a large portion also.  Add the Wedge & I think it would be a perfect meal.  We will see next time."}

I think the presentation was the most disappointing.  We ordered the app of shrimp ceviche and chips. Everything was just thrown on the plate - it was so messy.  They no longer have the turkey dinner so I opted for the tri tip. It was a bit dry and the muffin was way too sweet (sugar coated....ugh overkill...lose the sugar).  Kids pizza was decent sized but that was it....prices are high, a little too high for the food that was served.  I think the Towne Center location is Prob a little better than this one. Maybe one benefit is this is not as crowded....but that's it."}

This is the place to go for a lot of food for little cost. Most of the portions are good enough for two or more.  Even though my friends and I were not too hungry, the appetizer, soup, and sliders were enough to put us pass satisfied. The calamari ($11.99) were cut from some monster squid that always makes me think of eating rubber bands. The French Onion soup survived the down scale in size that some other dishes did not. The sliders came in an order of four with a pile of shoestring fries. Another friend had joined later on. He ordered the chicken tortilla soup and a chicken bow tie pasta. With an alcoholic drink, the total bill came to less than fifty before tip. I always enjoy the French onion, but otherwise it was a mediocre meal.

The Chicken Fried Steak seemed to have shrunk in size from what my husband remembers. His dinner salad had no taste, he said. I had the Caesar salad it wasn't bad. The chopped steak was good, the bread was good. My husband wasn't thrilled with his dinner. Too much batter not enough meat.  The waiter wasn't very attentive, though he did let me sample the cider before I ordered it. It just seemed the table next to us got more attention from their waitress.

I was always happy with the meals I got, but I did stick with what I knew for the most part. I mean let's face it there isn't THAT much opportunity to really get crazy and branch out here.  The salads in my opinion are great. Huge and if you get the lunch specials big portion for a great price. The portions of everything are massive so come hungry. The chicken pot pie is one of the best I've ever had. There is usually a good selection of soups including a yummy French Onion and Chicken Tortilla.   Dessert is a new level of portion size depending on what you get. At least LOOK at the dessert case as you walk in, just to stare in awe. The berry pies are awesome and if you get it to go there are instructions on how to warm it up best at home.   The service can vary from server to server. Sometimes they're at your beckoned call and other times it takes some flagging down to get attention. We almost always sat in the bar area so that could be part of the issue, it's a bit off the beaten path.

We were seated at 4:55 and noticed that the other diners at the hibachi table already had appetizers and drinks.   The waitress (Susanna?) came over and gave us our menus and asked what we wanted to drink and if we were ready to order. She was not the least bit friendly. We hadn't even opened the menus yet. We placed our drink orders and the soup and salads were placed in front of us and the other guests. She brought our drinks and again asked what we wanted to order. It was a really bad way to start our dining experience.   The food and the hibachi chef were good but nothing exceptional. One thing I don't like is getting all the components separately. I had finished each one before the next was ready. First came the fried rice, then the meat (which was a small portion) and then veggies were last. The check was brought before we were even finished eating or offered a dessert menu which I had to ask for. We actually left a little hungry.   We were rushed out at 5:50, Im guessing so they could seat the 6:00 guests. I thought it would be a nice relaxing dining experience but I was very wrong. Don't see any reason to return here."}

I know these chain restaurants are notorious for bad-for-you food, but until the person next to me found nutritional information on the table, I was in the dark.   *Bravo to Claim Jumper for publishing the nutritional information for every menu item and putting it on the table.  This is great for diabetics, etc and is actually quite impressive. *It is my psychological problem that I felt the need to look at it once I knew it was there, and learned that 99% of the menu items had more than any human's (besides sumo wrestlers or Michael Phelps) caloric intake, 600 times the sodium intake, etc.  I was frightened when I saw my order's nutrition so I just ate half and then walked for hours after at the District, and am eating a lean cuisine right now. *Like everyone else said, the menu is huge with lots of choices, but the food is nothing spectacular. *The mango iced tea is unsweetened and yummy. *MAJOR bravo for the vegetarian menu.  Most of my group eats vegetarian out and even as regulars, did not know about this.  You have to ask for it but there are tons of veggie options! *summary: good service, average food, nice ambiance, kudos for published albeit scary nutritional info, brownie points for veggie menu  UPDATE 11/18/09: Tilapia Veracruz is awesome.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I won't lie, I am livid as I'm writing this review. We've been to this Ohjah multiple times and usually it's pretty good. Tonight we went and every single part of my hibachi dinner was horrific.   The chef comes to the table, and he verified each persons order and asked how everyone would like their meat cooked. I ordered my steak rare. He starts making the fried rice first, and once it's done he's somehow confused about who ordered which sides. Everyone at the table ordered fried rice except one person who wanted noodles and one person who wanted fried rice without egg. So he separates the fried rice without egg first and gives it to the person. Then put egg in the rest of it. He's somehow confused about who has fried rice once it's done cooking. He starts passing it out starting with the two people on my right, then somehow skips me and serves my husband and the entire rest of the table. Then he's STILL confused about who had fried rice. Well now that I'm the last person and he's been confused the entire time I get maybe 1/2 a bowl of rice while everyone got a full helping and since he waited so long and tried to make the bowl fuller by scraping all the burnt bits off the grill, mine is entirely burnt and crunchy and pretty much inedible.  Next came the vegetables. Thinking he'd feel bad for messing up the rice I thought I'd maybe get adequate vegetables but I was wrong. He went around starting on the other side so I was one of the last people and my portion was 75% onions and I got very little of a portion anyway, while he then passed around extras to others.   He then started the meat. He's cooking all of it and AGAIN comes back to me to ask the temperature of cook I'd like, I again say rare and he responds with medium rare?, I say no, rare and he says medium rare? I say again no rare and he says oh, okay, rare! So I have he audacity to think that this is the one part of my meal he'd get right. NOPE! There's shrimp, lobster, chicken, and two types of steak on the grill. Somehow, my steak is the LAST thing to come off the grill and it's WELL DONE, like dry nasty well done. I'm fuming at this point and $70 later I didn't get to enjoy any of the hibachi dinner and left hungry. I hate being the person who sends food back or asks for the manager and with how irritated I was I just wanted to go home. I would never want to have that chef again and I probably won't be back as I've never had bad hibachi until tonight."}

I then had a Ceasar side salad and the Caesar dressing was completely flavorless.

The sides I picked was the roasted veggies, mash potato and caesar's salad. First that came was the salad and it looked so bad. i counted less than 20 cabbage and 2 croutons with barely any dressing. It was so shitty. I had to order the croutons and the dressing which i didn't have to do before. Next was the main dish. The tri tips. I liked my meat medium rare but this dish was hard and the slices are paper thin. My mother ordered the same exact order except she chose chowder soup instead of the salad and rice instead of the mash. Her soup was way over cook plus the rice looked like the rice you had for leftovers and was stuck in a fridge and heated in a microwave. This use to be my most favorite steakhouse. Unfortunately today the quality went super low. Very very disappointed."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "The name Sushi Cafe is a little misleading, disappointing and underwhelming. The last thing Sushi Cafe is, is just another sushi joint. Bento Cafe? Sushi burrito Cafe? Lunch box Cafe? Poki Cafe? All of those would bring more people in and would better describe their menu.  I think the highlight of Sushi Cafe is their Protein Box lunches. Rice, veggies, seaweed salad, korokke, egg and your choice of meat = Protein box. The Monster Box includes a giant sushi burrito and 5 pieces of sushi. SUCH a good deal AND they serve it in those cute brown boxes and not styrofoam- yippeee!  I've had the fried white fish and the chicken protein box. Fried white fish: I was a little worried at first (it looked like the frozen fish sticks you can buy), but they were far from it. There was plenty of fish in it and it tasted GOOD. I loved it, but for me, having fried fish and also fried korokke in the box was a little too much fry for me. It put me into a food coma way too fast.  Chicken protein box: yes, yes, yes. So much chicken! The sauce is in a container on the side so you don't have to be worried about it being drenched in teriyaki.   The sushi bento boxes were another story.  The quality of the nigiri was HORRIBLE and the giant rolls were pretty bad. The salmon in my roll was so tough I couldn't bite through it. It was like chewing on rubber- a couple of bites of that and I had to spit it out. It was easily the worst piece of fish I've ever had. I would not recommend ordering anything with raw fish from here.   There is no AC in Sushi Cafe................................ I wouldn't recommend eating here, just taking out on your lunch break or on your way home. They also have some Japanese snacks, drinks (Calpis, etc) for sale and cup noodle with a hot water machine as well."}

Opening it back in the office I was greeted by a cup of rice, seaweed salad, tamago , some dumplings and the bulgogi.  Rice was done well, seaweed was not too dry or salty, but I wish I didn't get the cucumbers under it, the tamago was sweet, but dumplings was alright. The bulgogi though... I've had better. It wasn't badddd per se but it was just...bulgogi. What I usually see people get wrong is that the meat gets really hard and dry but Sushi Cafe didn't have that. The juices also seeps down and kind of mix in with the rice which I have no complaints about. I would suggest less... purple cabbage(?) as it had a very bitter taste to it... but that's just me.

And worst part is when the Yellowtail came, it was just hard as rocks because they were frozen. Disappointing!"}

The last two times I've been here the usual lady that takes my order has been in the back sleeping -and the wait staff doesn't speak English. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem, but if you have any questions or ask any specific things...there's a language barrier. Very frustrating when you're hungry and the guy keeps smiling and nodding but has no clue what you're asking.  Last time they put mixed greens that were warm and wilted in my sushi...gross.  This time they ended up waking the lady in the back room and we were able to order. But three things still came out wrong!! One thing was never brought out. And yet they did nothing to fix it nor adjust the bill.  Not a good experience at all. Won't be coming here again."}

About a year ago, a Monster Box was a Sushi burrito, 4 pieces of Nigiri, and 2 potstickers for $9.99.. Fast forward to about 6 months ago, and the sushi burrito was $9.99 alone, with the Monster box coming in at $13 or so. That's cool. Inflation. I come in 2 weeks ago, and asked for the Monster Box. The lady who's ALWAYS at the register (more on her later), said they don't have that anymore, but she'll hook me up with it as a special. She rang me up. Came to over $16. She just charged me regular prices for all 3 items. That THREE price changes in less than a year. Not cool. Not consistent.  Back to the lady. I understand she has to sell people on their product but she's literally borderline harassing. Twice in the past few months, me and my ex visited and she pushes and pushes and pushes their special rolls. Even after you tell her no, not interested, she walks by asking, Are you sure? ...and even walked someone else's special roll past us to show us. We finally ordered it to shut her up. It was AMAZING! ..but that's besides the point. I eat sushi all over the country. Never am I pressured EVERY time I go. Even when ordering the Monster Box to go, she tries to get you to get the special. It's really annoying.  Will I be back? Yep. I'm leaving here right now actually. Would I come a lot more if they had consistent pricing and the lady at front had a muzzle? Absolutely.  Also: Call ahead.

You would think the large cup of what looked like whipped butter would be perfect.  Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. It was a large cup of whipped ... fake something.

There are cool little stores nearby to kill a few minutes in.  Service: The service was good. That was one thing I enjoyed about the place. Our server was ready to recommend items and substitutes for entrees at the drop of a hat. In fact we saved a little money from it. BONUS!  Price: This area made me sad. You get a lot of food, yes, but everything was overpriced. I got a Joes scramble which was about 10 dollars. I could have made it at home for a fraction of the price. Their coffee is 2.25 for a cup. OUCH. I'm used to being kind of tight with my money, so everything on the menu made my wallet cry. Especially since you can make a lot of it at home.  Quality: The quality of the food was good. On par to what you would expect from a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. The portions are good and everything is well cooked. The eggs are fluffy and the potatoes weren't overcooked.   Overall: It was a decent experience but once was more then enough for me. There are other places to go for a good breakfast and that cost half as much. I suggest going there once to try it and judge yourself."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Still on the hunt for a good burger in an unassuming restaurant, I recently ventured to The Cracked Egg's Henderson location. It's been in my to-do list on my phone for a while now, pulled from some Yelp list that hasn't really brought me any real treats yet. Most people's recommendations and opinions for food are typically below my expectations, but someone has to come through right? Looks like I might have to keep going on that list.  The Cracked Egg is in a typical local strip mall and blends in with everything else from the outside like the rest of our mundane suburban locations. The inside is very open, pretty loud and not that fancy. Some breakfast themed restaurants have a slightly cozier feel than this, but in no means is it uninviting or that bad.  This restaurant is really a breakfast place, and the menu reflects that all the way; you have the full gamut of breakfast choices but I'm sure way better than anything you'd find at an IHOP. The burger options make up a very small section of the menu, with only a few choices that seem like typical offerings for a menu like this.  I went with a mushroom and Swiss burger to once again sample a baseline offering, as they don't really give you the option for a stand-out feature burger. What you're given is a pretty standard looking plate with a good sized burger, pickle wedge, lots of onion, a very large piece of lettuce and some oddly seasoned fries. The seemingly pre-made (not hand-made) patty was thin, yet juicy. It had ok flavor, but wasn't really cooked medium as I had asked. The bun was a bit thin, and made me nervous based on how juicy the burger was, but still held up through to the end. The mushrooms and Swiss both had good flavor and were welcome toppings, whereas my giant hunk of lettuce was a bit much.  As I said before, the fries had an odd seasoning on them I can't quite place. They were just ok, not that fresh and not too crispy. Overall the meal was just ok, depending on how much of a factor you consider the fries to be I don't have too much to complain about, but it just wasn't that great overall. At $8.95 it's not a horrible price, but I've had far better from some other less-than-fancy places lately that were even cheaper. If you're a breakfast lover I'm sure you couldn't go wrong here, but if you're looking for a good cheap burger in Henderson, there are much better places."}

We chose the seasoned potatoes, the hash brown, and the coffee cake to go with our food.  The coffee cake was warm and moist, with cherries at the bottom.  Tasted delicious with the coffee.

Starved and fatigue since the night before, this sweet beginning couldn't have come at a better time.    I knew I wanted some scrambled eggs but my rational mind opted for an omelette with vegetables, the Garden Patch.  It was a wrong choice as I was eyeing my friend's scrambled eggs the whole time.  Luckily I got to steal some and heavenly fluffy it was.  Don't get me wrong.  The Garden Patch omelette would have been a great hit if I were a rabbit.  Note to self - never put broccoli in an omelette.  Go for the hashbrown if you can.

Typically I love this place, but usually eat at Egg Works (my friend prefers it)  However, I had purchased a Groupon to The Cracked Egg so I needed to use it.  The catch. I accidentally purchased a groupon that I could only use Mon-Fri.  Since I am always at work M-F, It ended up expiring.  If anyone knows anything about Groupon it states right on the page that the value you used to purchase the groupon never expires.

My boyfriend and I basically go every Saturday...so with that being said, I was REALLY ASTOUNDED by what happened today...  BUGS IN OUR FOOD. THE FOOD-ON THE PLATE-EVERYWHERE.  My boyfriend ordered the croissant french toast, and I got one of the egg scrambles. All was fine, and then I saw a little brown bug crawling on the side of my boyfriend's plate. I looked closer, and saw literally 5 of them...and then more...I immediately told him to stop eating. We called our server over and she took the plate away. I then decided I couldn't eat because I was so insanely grossed out. The server then brought over our check and charged us for everything except my boyfriend's meal.

After 5 minutes of searching the small restaurant for her, she came out and seemed ANNOYED to talk to him. She had a smug don't care attitude. My boyfriend is wayyyy too nice in my opinion...and the manager said that this is the food industry and that bugs happen. !!!!!!!!!!!! What!!! management should never ever tell their patrons that. My boyfriend then asked her how she would feel if she had bugs in her food and her reply, well, i grew up around animals so I wouldn't have cared. !!!!!!! What!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally after the manager made my boyfriend feel like an idiot for politely complaining, she said, ok, if it'll make you happy, i'll take off your girlfriends meal too. That wasn't even it! It was the principle behind everything!!!!!!  I teach service recovery in the hospitality for a living and that was the most piss poor excuse of a manager I have ever encountered.

The dish is served on traditional English muffins, topped with tomatoes, poached eggs and avocado, smothered in hollandaise. Yet don't forget the Potatoes, these little squares, seem to be deep fried and seasoned yet not quite to perfection, but all the same they are good. I would say that the hollandaise could be thicker. But as a whole this restaurant has a menu with a wide range of traditional breakfast and lunch favorites. This wham bam breakfast joint, is a nice place to go with family and friends in a very relaxed environment, even appropriate for a quick breakfast or lunch for any business oriented outing. This location is definitely going to give the corporate chop shops, IHOP, Denny's, and the Original Pancake House a worthy competitor in the turf war that is breakfast.

I asked about the holladaise sauce and she didn't know hot describe it other than it was yellow. Hmmmm, I wasn't too please there so I ordered something I was familiar with.   Orders were:   Monte Cristo - Turkey, ham, cheese, and bread dipped in french toast batter and fried to a crisp.  It was very interesting, it came with syrup and 2 sides of either hash browns or seasoned potatoes and eggs.  Although the concept was interesting, I thought it was ok.  It was a weird combination and it did go together, but it's something I probably wouldn't try again.    Biscuits and Gravy - Biscuits served with gravy, the name says it all.  The biscuits were really soft and the consistency of it with the gravy did compliment each other well. Oddly though, I prefer the biscuits and gravy at South Point's Coronado Cafe.  Now that says a lot, especially since that's not voted Best of Las Vegas.  The gravy was ok, there were meats here in there, but it did taste a little watered down.    There were a lot of other things that I did want to try, but it didn't seem as interesting.  I'd probably return here cause the service was good, and the seating was fast."}

Second,  there was a lot of cross contamination going on. I have went to school for culinary so I know all the requirements working in a kitchen and serving food. My server kept rubbing his nose because it was running. Also, he coughed in his hands and then went to vet the toast out and put it on my plate and served me. Then as I'm eating I found an eye lash in my potatoes. The server was caucasian and had tattoos. Will never go there again thanks to him."}

On my latest visit I had The Garden Patch Omelet which had broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese. The omelet was around $10 and came out very dry, almost inedible if it wasn't for the pounds of melted cheese on top. The veggies on the inside were mushy and indistinguishable. The side of hash browns was okay, as was the toast... but a hefty price to pay for some toast and small side of hash browns. I picked at my omelet, and left over half of it un eaten. My previous visits here were equally unmemorable, but I got to catch up with lovely Jaime W here, so I opted to give this place another shot. I think this will be my last visit to The Cracked Egg though."}

I was really excited to try The Cracked Egg as I love trying breakfast places, and I wanted to compare it to some other local places we have been. I wanted to love the experience so much, but I couldn't. I didn't feel that relaxed, comfortable, local feel. As in, the service was below average. I understand places such as here get busy but I worked in the restaurant industry for years so while I can be flexible and understanding I still expect good service. Our server hurried over and asked immediately wanted to order. I asked a couple of questions, we asked recommendations (she did not give us any). I wanted to do a build your own because there were a few extra things I wanted to add to my skillet. She told me just order the corned beef hash skillet off the menu instead of doing build your own (in an annoyed tone) and said it cost less (which it did not, and she said it in an insulting way as if I was trying to jip her or something). I took her recommendation anyways. I love corned beef hash, I order it almost every breakfast place I go but this was not up there compared to some other restaurant's in the areas of quality, taste, and value. I will say the coffee cake was to die for!! I absolutely loved it. The texture, temperature, and flavor was perfect. Our server wasn't seen again the whole meal except to come over and grab our plates (I wasn't done yet) and give us the check. I felt rushed in and out. I just sadly wish our dining experience out on this occasion could have been better. I was disappointed."}

The sausage gravy had great texture (not too thick/not too runny) and flavor, which is difficult to find on this side of the country!  The biscuits were soft and the egg was cooked perfectly.  I wasn't impressed by the seasoned potatoes, but after eating the main entree, I didn't have much room for them, anyway.

Coffee cake was absolutely delicious so I am glad I read the reviews and knew to order it. Four dollars for orange juice was pretty steep when the entree itself cost ten dollars. Lesson learned though.   Overall 10$ for a small omelet and 4$ for orange juice leaves me wanting a lot more for the price.

We came to meet my mom and surprise her, we asked to have one of the several empty tables near my mom's table pulled next to her table and my mom's server refused, because it wasn't her section. Uh ok, whatever! So my husband and I just sit at a table next to my mom and wait and wait and wait for our server who never comes. I say to my husband, I think we need to let the hostess know since we just sat here. So I did and apologized for not making her aware of us taking the table and could she get our server.  The hostess was more than put out but I ignored it. Our server grudgingly showed up, took our order and disappeared, never to be heard from again until our food showed. I had two eggs over medium, they were fine except my food was served on a  warped plastic plate that kept spinning every time I ate off of it. My husband ordered basic eggs Benedict. The eggs were so under cooked that the whites looked literally like snot. So nasty. He pointed it out to the server and she proceeded to tell him that's how eggs Benedict are served and continued to argue with him even after he told her that was not true. The manager who came over was quite nice and apologetic and removed the EB from our bill with out hassle. It took forever to get our bill from the disgruntled server and when we finally did, it appeared that the EB had not been removed. I asked the previously rude hostess who is now our cashier to look into it and she proceeds to tell me that the reason we had such a bad experience was because we had sat ourselves. Well needless to say at this point, I'm offended beyond reason and I begin to lose it with the hostess. The manager comes again and is very nice again, but he clearly has no control over his staff. I NOR MY HUSBAND WILL EVER FREQUENT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! The food is not worth the hassle and it's very over priced. I ended up paying $18 for two eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon,  and coffee. And as someone else that wrote a review stated the entire wait staff starting with the hostess are rude, unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor. Stay away. I had been going there since the place opened and kept having bad experiences, which culminated into my last and final atrocious experience."}

They keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendly and warm.  The menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration I decided to go light and try the Lowfat Scramble which combines Egg Whites scrambled with Chicken, Diced Green Chiles, Tortilla Chips and Salsa. The mouth feel of this dish is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy Tortilla Chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients. I had a hard time figuring out what was Chicken and what was Tortilla Chip until it was too late. Tortilla Chips should never be soggy, this you can trust.  This wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.     I may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now I can only give 2 stars worth of bleh."}

We always have left overs no matter what we order.   I've tried breakfast and lunch items, but honestly nothing really stands out as wow I need to order this again. The only thing worth mentioning is their COFFEE CAKE! It's served warm and it's so so soft. The flavor changes daily but my favorite has got to be the strawberry or the pumpkin. Even if I order a burger, I will still order me a side of coffee cake, it's that good.   The service is hit or miss. I've had servers who looked happy to be there. However, I've also had servers who hated their lives and it showed. On our last visit, our server seemed to be rushing through the motions. No biggie though. The one thing I'm definitely not a fan of is the waiting area. It can get congested really fast. With customers having to go to the register to pay, that just adds to even more congestion.  I'm not in any rush to eat here again. But I wouldn't be opposed for someone suggested this for breakfast."}

While my husband waited in line at the register, Monica returned to the register area and told a waiting customer, we are trying to get you seated together, but some people just won't leave, you know how that is.

Like many Americans, I find myself skipping the most important meal of the day, however, once in a while, breakfast is valid.  Today was one of those days.  My boss and I decided to have our meeting at The Cracked Egg, for a change of scenery.  AMBIANCE: The place is alright.  The decor is a little drab and boring.  There are booths and table tops, as well as a bar top to choose from.  I think it's kind of a lame attempt at a diner/breakfast nook-ish ambiance.  Hard to pin point, because nothing really comes together for me.  I do know, however, that it's very busy.  A lot of people seem to enjoy this place.  I'm guessing it's because of the food. LOL.  FOOD and SERVICE:  Today, I got the Eggs Benedict for $9.95.  The bread was kinda of soggy.  Although this entree is smothered with hollandaise, I've had a lot of benedicts to know the potential of the bottom bread.  The poached egg was cooked perfectly, the canadian bacon was thicker than what I'm used to, which is good.  The hollandaise was thicker than what I prefer.  My entree came with hash browns which was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  The way it should be!  YUM!  All in all, my breakfast was a hit.  Here's where The Cracked Egg falls short for me.  Whenever I come into this restaurant, I always end up driving separately and meeting my party there.  If I'm the first person there, I'll get a table.  Although my entire party has not arrived yet, the server DOES NOT greet our table until all members of the party arrive.  This was the third occurence that I've noticed.  I think as courtesy, they should at least greet any member of the party, no matter what percentage is present.  I will say that they have employees taking beverage orders in the beginning which I appreciate.  Two instances though, including today, I needed to order right away so I could leave early and make a meeting at work.  That's where I see the benefit of the actual server coming by to greet whoever is there.  Please don't let my rant determine your decision to visit this place.  The food is actually good.  I appreciate the fact that they have healthy options like Garden Patch omelette, the lowfat scrambble, Lighten Up scrambble and an option to have fruit as your side instead of starch options.  Their menu is filled with lots of a great choices.  Please go in and try their coffee cakes.  They are to die for!"}

This is not my favorite location, but the food is definitely good.   As everyone has already pointed out, the coffee cake is fantastic. It is not exactly what you think of when people say coffee cake, it is more like a white cake with some fruit filling on the bottom and some delicious frosting on top. My only gripe is that I wish they told you what kind of coffee cake they had that day and that there was just a little more fruit filling.  We usually end up getting a skillet, but they also have delicious pancakes! I am in love with the Kicking Potatoes, seasoned potatoes, bits of bacon, and melted cheddar cheese, served with a side of salsa and sour cream. I also like the option to make your own skillet and if you are in the mood for veggies, the vegetarian skillet is a fantastic option. Most of the skillets also come with coffee cake, win!  Now, I am usually very satisfied with the food, but have received spotty service from this location. Nobody seems too happy to be working here, from the hostess, to the waitstaff, to the manager. I have even seen the manager take on a customer who had a food allergy and was very specific about his order, which they messed up. I don't think it is ever OK to argue with a customer, especially in this situation where it could have gotten really severe if the customer had a life or death allergy. There were quite a few people in the restaurant and the loud exchange was certainly avoidable, I think a sincere apology would have gone a long way. I was also present when they messed up a rather large take-out order for some of my fellow team mates at work and didn't do much to rectify the situation.   I also really dislike the fact that you have to take your check up to the cash register. That area can get very congested in the morning since it is also the hostess station. If you manage to fight the crowd and make it to the register, I find it quite uncomfortable that they ask you how much tip you would like to leave. I don't understand why they can't just let you fill out the receipt like every other business. Overall, the food is good, but don't prepare to be WOWed by the service."}

It wasn't steel cut oats, just regular Quaker Oats you add water to and it was served with brown sugar, milk, cheap cereal stale granola and a cup of berries, mostly blackberries. It was a healthy portion of oatmeal, but it should have cost closer to $5. I did try the coffee cake, which was good but not out of this world.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I'd give it 2.5 stars if possible simply because most of the food is good (not great, not mediocre, just good).  However, the food is overpriced, portions are not huge, and service is usually bad.  Count on spending $12-15 per person for a meal, tax, and tip; add a few more bucks if you're getting a beverage.  Coworkers who suggested this place to me said I could have a full meal for $6; based on menu prices, I assume my coworkers consider toast and coffee a full meal.  The restaurant is very loud and cramped.  Your wooden chairs will get bumped into by anyone trying to pass and the screeching of wood on tiles will give you a headache.  There isn't much of a waiting area and given this place's popularity, you'll probably have to wait.  My chicken chile verde omelet was good, seasoned potatoes very tasty, and our various sandwiches good but nothing special.  The coffee cake was awful.  It was like stale angel cake purchased from a gas station, sprinkled with cinnamon, and stuffed with canned apple pie filling.  Good service usually changes my opinion of a restaurant, but this was downright bad.  Our waiter was curt, only gave us one coffee refill (after flagging him down), and tossed our check on the table before we'd finished eating.  The restaurant was significantly less crowded than when we arrived so I'm not sure why he was in such a hurry to get rid of us.  We're nice people who have worked in restaurants and sympathize with overbusy waitstaff.  I only go here when I'm with pretentious friends who insist on eating at local mom & pop shops instead of IHOP or Denny's.  Eat here if you must and enjoy your smug satisfaction; I'll be over at IHOP feasting on better food for less money."}

I usually end up ordering the same thing: Chicken Fried Steak Skillet. It is a chicken fried steak over a bed of house potatoes, smothered in delicious gravy and topped with copious amounts of cheese. I usually order the two eggs that come with in on the side rather than on the skillet.   I am not a fan of their omelettes. I think they lack a little flavor and flare, especially for the cost.   One thing that is great here is their coffee cake. They usually have a different flavor every time I go.   My main complaint about this place, aside from their omelettes (I like omelettes with meat, and their big bad wolf omelette (or whatever it is called) is definitely not laden with meat as you are led to believe) is that their service is slow. While I don't work there so can't know for sure, I would attribute it to how busy they are and a staff that is not large enough to handle everything. They also have a waitress there who never seems to like what she is doing. When I go out for breakfast, I don't want to deal with other people's problems and bad moods. That needs to be checked at the front door when the waitress comes in to work.   Aside from that, I do like this place, especially their chicken fried steak skillet.

Whether you're in the mood for their breanne's basic, fluffy and folded omelettes or eggs with attitude scramble you can't go wrong. Also, depending on how busy they are you might opt out of ordering an omelette since per usual they take longer to make. The portions are generous as well.    Today, I got a veggie skillet with turkey bacon. I was thrown off by the turkey bacon since it looks liked ham. It didn't taste like your regular turkey bacon too.   Overall it's a plain Jane spot with bland coffee to their entrees and sometimes that's exactly want you may want for the first meal of the day. And if it's not then bring your own sauce for flavor!

She tried to make little quirky jokes every time she came to the table, but they just came off like she was mad at the world and we were the cause of it. Like I said very TV sitcom-ish.   The decor here needs to be updated desperately. It has a cafeteria look; very open and very cold, but with a country grandma style. By this I mean there's random farm and rooster decor on the walls. Which makes me laugh because roosters don't lay eggs. It's Science!   The food is tasty, but basic. I was here with four other people and I tried everyone's dish... I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad; the salad for the guy who never orders salad. This was great in my opinion, big chunks of chicken coated in buffalo sauce on huge bed of fresh greens w/ eggs and tomatoes. My foodie friends ordered the Veggie Benny, The Cobb, and the Pesto Scramble.   The Veggie Benny was the star in this line-up. This plate comes with spinach, avocado, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, but lite in an interesting way, and the hash browns were golden brown and crispy. I would most likely order this if I came back to the Cracked Egg. The other dishes were forgetful and don't need to be mentioned in this review.   This place needs a design overhaul and few updates on the menu. These simple changes could really elevate this place...Where's Robert Irvine?!?  Pro Tip: The baked goods in this place are steller.

The one time we decide to branch out to the other restaurants and it doesn't start off well at all. Our organizer checked it out a week ago and even called in a reservation for our large group. We get here and they apologize profusely because they allowed a large party of 17 people in just before us and pretty much told us calling in advance for reservations does not do any good. Not professional or organized. Not good for planned large parties, especially parties with several elderly and handicapped members.   If you do want one that will actually honor large planned gatherings, professionally and with organizational skills, one who won't blame your party for their lack of both, then try Egg Works on Sunset. Not good, The Cracked Egg, not good.   I'll update if we ever get a table.  We were seated at 30 min after we arrived and now feeling a little better. The server was very nice and prompt.   Okay, now that I've had coffee and my MIL is comfortable, I'm going to upgrade the rating to 3 stars. Menu looks nice and I'm excited to try the coffee cake.   Food and service was excellent.

The hash browns were crispy on the outside / tops and bottoms, but somewhat soggy in the centers. The chicken-fried steak was perfectly crispy on the outside, and the gravy was good. I'm not sure what all the hullabaloo about the seasoned potatoes is - ours were hard, dry, and extremely salty.   Service: came right at lunchtime on a Saturday, but managed to get seated right away. Service started out great, but after the initial greeting, any time we needed anything we had to flag down the waitress. The only time she spontaneously stopped by was to drop off the bill, about 5 minutes after the food came out. Upon checkout, if you pay with a card, the hostess asks if you would like to add a tip to the card. I find this incredibly uncomfortable and puts pressure on patrons to tip maybe more than they normally would. I would much rather have them include a tip line on the receipt so I can tip as much or as little as I would like without feeling guilty or embarrassed. Maybe they do this on purpose to help their waitstaff earn more money in tips? Next time I will bring cash to leave on the table instead."}

My friend Lisa L had the pancakes and I had the tropical french toast... I know the description said coconut but this thing was COVERED in shredded coconut. Like the whole surface was pretty much shredded coconut. The flavor was great and the texture was nice but I literally filled up on shredded coconut. We spent about 20 minutes sitting around waiting for our server to come back so we could get our bill and though he walked by like four times, he didn't so much as glance in our direction. By this time, the crowd had really thinned out too so it's not like it was crazy busy. The food was good enough to warrant three stars but the service left us frustrated. It would be one thing if the server was so busy he couldn't make it through the room but we saw him pass so many times and it took forever to flag him down."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "My boyfriend and I used to love the cracked egg. And when I say loved I mean we used to come almost every weekend (provided neither of us worked in the morning). However neither of us have had the desire to return recently. In a nutshell, service is not up to par and the food has been mediocre at best.   First of all, I get that the servers may be tired considering they open at 6am but don't take that out on the patrons. The last couple times my boyfriend and I have been here we've felt rushed from the moment we sat down. And it's not one server in particular, it's all of them. Often we get asked if we know what we want to eat before we even order our drinks. Then 30 seconds after we get our food the check is dropped off. Can they be any more obvious that they want to go home? Doesn't make me feel welcome.   Secondly, the food has been a hit and miss lately. The skillets are always excellent. My favorite breakfast is eggs benedict and the last time I got it here it was very cold like it had been sitting out. *thumbs down* However, the coffee cake is great which is why I'm giving this place 2 stars.   Overall, I feel like the cracked egg could go back to what it used to be if changes are made and the staff are taught what QUALITY and SERVICE are. I won't be returning anytime soon."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "When we first arrived in Vegas, we visited The Cracked Egg on Rainbow. It was okay but nothing special. So when we found ourselves in Henderson during breakfast time and with a coupon, we decided to try it again.  It was about 1pm on Saturday and the place was mostly empty. Not a red flag really because the recession is killing the restaurant business. Service was pretty quick - sat down, ordered drinks from the helper, the waiter was so fast that I had to ask for a couple more minutes, and he came back in a couple of minutes. All was going well until I ordered. Club Sandwich - no ham, no mayo, bacon crispy, 1000 island dressing on the side - and fries. Sorry, we ran out of fries. What???? No fries???? Big red flag - obviously the fries are not made fresh. But, you may be thinking, perhaps they just ran out of potatoes. Possible, yes, but they still had the breakfast potatoes that were served with my husband's meal. So, I am really not happy about this situation. Not because of there being no fries as much as them not being made fresh. I mean, seriously, In-N-Out makes fries - from real potatoes - all day long. However, I did regroup and try to enjoy my lunch.  As I said, I had the Club Sandwich. It was good - came with avocado and cheese which is a huge bonus for me and not always included. Unfortunately, it was nothing special. And, believe it or not, it was too big for my mouth so I had to cut it up.   My husband had a Sausage Scramble which was not actually scrambled together but layered. He said it was quite nice (that is like 4 stars in ratings talk). And, his coffee was getting refilled promptly AND they gave him more creamers than he could use. So, overall, great meal for the hubby.  I have seen some of the other reviews raving about the breakfast items and perhaps that is where I went wrong. If we go again (which we probably will since I have another coupon), I am thinking I will try the Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes. I will let you know."}

The chicken fried steak is VERY solid at this place.  Additionally, the specials are usually good, so check those out.  It's a large restaurant, so even during heavy traffic times the wait is usually not awful.  Also, kid friendly."}

We had the following:  The Veggie Skillet with Corned Beef $10.90  The Sweet Potato Skillet $10.50  Coconut and macadamia nut pancakes $8.95  My veggie skillet was pretty good. I loved the mix of broccoli, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes with the fried potatoes (and meat of course). My wife gave her skillet 6/10 bc she said her potatoes were not so crispy. I wouldn't recommend the pancakes as the coconut is not fresh coconut but coconut from a prepackaged bag. That kind of coconut is too sweet and with added syrup made the dish too sweet for my tastebuds. The one good aspect here is that the skillets came with their signature coffee cake (or toast if u prefer). Their coffee cake was pretty good. The texture was so light and soft and way better than Starbucks. After 4 or 5 bites however, it does becomes a little too sweet so I suggest sharing one with another person."}

After we had finished our food and before our plates were cleared, our server brought a nearby table their food, then got in a conversation with another table and his back was to us. He talked so long that the first table FINISHED their meal and he was still talking, ignoring everyone else. All we wanted was our check. Finally a third table asked if he could please check on their food and he was not pleased at being interrupted. He informed her that he has other tables, not just her, and stormed off to the kitchen. Rude. And to top it all off, 30 minutes after leaving both my husband and myself (we ordered different foods and different drinks) were extremely ill. Gut wrenching horribleness.

There are so many food options in Vegas and Henderson that to be treated with poor service, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.   It started from the moment we walked in. For some reason the hostess had an attitude, barely said two words to us, walked us to the table, put our menus on the table without a word, and walked away. Then it took about 10 min before anyone came up. Mind you this was 1:15 on Friday. By no means busy. We were ready to order, and I told the waitress we were in a hurry because we were on a lunch break. I ordered the Monte Cristo which clearly states on the menu comes with hash browns or home fried potatoes, something like that. When I order, she says do you want French fries. Threw me off because that wasn't a choice. Then the coffee cake was burnt on the bottom. Why would you even serve that. That's always been my favorite thing there. We ate the top but it just wasn't as good. You could clearly tell there was a problem with it and she never asked about it the entire time we were there. In fact, she left the plate with all its burnt crumbs on our table the the entire meal. It's like she wanted us to be taunted by it.   Then the food came about a good 15 min later. We are starting to panic by this point because we have to get back to work. There is no way all of this should have taken closer to an hour. I have a deep fried sandwich for crying out loud. I swear she put our food in late. We know that doesn't take that long. When the food comes, I ask for the check right away, and my daughter asks for ranch. She's brings the check but we never see the ranch nor do we see her again. Not once. I had to ask a bus boy for a container for the rest of my sandwich. Which by the way the sandwich was burnt as well. Very crispy.  You have to pay up front. The person up there asks how it was, and I said not good. She either is inexperienced on how to handle that response or she just didn't care. All I heard in response was her mumbling under her breath oh sorry to hear that as she's facing the cash register ringing me out. That's it. We'll take our money elsewhere."}

We ordered coffee, and I like that there was regular cream as well as vanilla creamer already at the table. The coffee was really good. Nice and hot, and had good flavor.   Our coffee cake came out very quickly, and after about three bites of that our breakfast arrived. The coffee cake was very crumbly, but really flavorful. Nice vanilla flavor with a hint of lemon in the icing. The eggs Benedict was not a huge portion, actually rather small. Definitely not worthy of sharing like we typically do. Good to know, so next time we will actually get separate breakfasts. I like their use of green chiles throughout the menu, so we will be checking those out at some point.   We arrived at 9:30 Sunday, and the place was jamming. It was loud, but not bad. We felt rushed, even though our server made sure to tell us we were not to be in any hurry. But with our breakfast coming out in mere minutes, and the small portions we were done quickly. The line to pay was really long. That was just bad timing on our part.

Not that service is not imporatant, but so often rates from pretty good to very good no matter where. I cannot say the same for this particualar location however. I have been there a few times for breakfast, and while the food never dissapoints, the service does. It is unlikely I would never serve a server, but this was the first place a few months ago the made me do exactly that. Not indifferent servce, downright rude service. Went there on Saturday (4th) for breakfast with my wife. As we walked in, we were instantly greetes with a dour faced blonde who blurted out,,,2? Nice. Would it be too much to say welcome, or smile, or good morning, or anything, besides 2? As we sat close to the door, I watched virtually the same 'greeting' for everyone that walked in. I saw a male employee arrive by the front door. He didn't get even so much as a 1?. There just seems to be a culture of unhappiness or something here. And it was not like our server seemed to offer much more.Cheer up people. Is it really so bad having a job there?"}

Normally I'd start ordering everything that looks appetizing, but nothing caught my eye. Maybe because I didnt know where to look.  Also im baffled at how huge the salads were, but then the entrees are so so, and you only get a soup cup of 8oz. It makes no sense!!! Like is the salad an entree?

The chopped salad was the worst salad ever. No server came and asked if everything is ok. So here's my advice.... Do not give a server a busy station, servers need to communicate with customers as people because last time I check I was a person and I can be talked to about anything. The manager was absolutely amazing and I thank him for that but no service recovery helped us. Please retrain your servers. The customers deserve that for giving you their money and are there for a positive experience so they will be repeat customers. I hope this changes because it's just another checked off place that I will never go to."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Update/January 2017:  After I had written my letter in June 2015, I reluctantly hoped that the level of service would rise and match the pleasant dining atmosphere and the great food that Sammy's has to offer. Indeed, we had not frequented Sammy's for over a year, thinking that instituting some necessary changes would take some time. Several months ago, we decided to return and were very pleasantly surprised that the level of customer service had improved a great deal. But, after several satisfactory visits, we found yesterday that things at your Henderson location had really not changed at all.  Yesterday evening, Saturday at 5pm, we were promptly seated at our table by a very friendly hostess, who recited the standard line that a server will be with us right away. This section of the restaurant was empty when we arrived and we were seated very near the hostess's reception desk and in plain view for all to see. During the 15 minute wait time, we witnessed some very astonishing events.  First, the hostess, who had seated us, seated an elderly couple next to us. As she walked by, she had not noticed that we had not been greeted by any server. Second, the busboy who was preparing a table for 12-14 next to us, walked by twice to move chairs and a table needed for the larger group. He also had not noticed that no one had greeted us. Third, and most disappointing of all, the manager on duty would never have noticed us because she was very busy displaying her new manicure to the hostess. After 15 minutes of holding menus and not being offered a glass of water in an empty section of the restaurant, we concluded that no one cared whether we stayed or departed. So, we departed Sammy's, disappointed once again. Our departure triggered a reaction that was totally unexpected. The manager with the fresh manicure ran after us in the parking lot. Apparently, someone had alerted her that we had left and she confronted us, mumbling something about inviting us back in, and taking care of something..... By then, we had decided to eat elsewhere.  I need not remind you that we have very many dining choices in the area. Our favorites are Elephant Bar, Black Mountain Grill, Pin Kaow Thai, and Kabuki. Please direct your attention to Pin Kaow on Eastern Avenue, which we started visiting recently. Their customer service is outstanding. The hostess is constantly attentive to the dining customer's needs. You should take some lessons from her.  June 2015  Hello Mr Ladeki: Hello Mr Anthony Kulick, Hello Ms Joanna Train,  It is again very unfortunate that we were sadly subjected to a disappointing dining experience as a result of the mismanagement and lack of training of your service personnel. My email with similar concerns which I had sent last year was apparently ignored by your executive team as my family and I have noticed no discernible difference in the quality of your service. This is not to say that the wait staff is in any way rude or unfriendly. They are polite and cordial, but they are at a distinct disadvantage if they are not trained properly and therefore robbed of the opportunity to sell more product, generate more revenue, and earn more gratuities.  How can it be that on a Sunday around 5:15pm, when the Green Valley restaurant is at my best estimate one third full, when there are at least 8 or 9 servers all running in different directions including past our table MULTIPLE times, when there is one very clueless onsite manager running all around, and within the entire 15 minutes after being seated and reading menus, that NO ONE, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON, can take responsibility and assume the duty and obligation to greet us at the table and assure us that our server will be with us shortly? Within those 15 minutes, NO ONE even asked us if we wanted water on a day where the temperature outside was 108 degrees!! I am sure that your very inattentive wait staff was very, very busy doing other things in preparation for the evening crowd, but this lack of a simple greeting is unacceptable.  I know 15 minutes is not a long time in the scheme of world events. But some patrons know what they want when they sit down. At the very least, they know what they would like to drink. Perhaps you should convert the restaurant into a self-serve establishment and eliminate the need for staff and a clueless onsite manager.  Please do not offer your phone number to discuss my concerns. I do not care to be offered any special treatment because I raise these issues. When I walk into a restaurant and have minimal expectations, I expect them to be met without having to write a long-winded Yelp post. Certainly I have better things to do with my time than to bring these deficiencies to your attention.   We left Sammy's and wandered over to the Black Mountain Grill, where we were greeted by the server within 60 seconds of being seated. What a world of difference!  Perhaps you should visit Black Mountain Grill yourself and observe their operations."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "For awhile I was on a Sammy's kick and wanted to come here all the time. This spot is close to home and I like the ambiance inside of the restaurant. It has a sort of Florida feel.  The brunch here is great. The menu has a nice variety of options and all of the food is really good. I love the small plates here, especially the Lettuce Cups, Lobster Mac & Cheese, & Edamame. They also have a Raclette & Potato pizza that I enjoyed. It was a thin crust pizza with potato and cheese. It didn't have a traditional marinara pizza sauce making it a little different. Different in a good way. The Salted Caramel Pudding for dessert was one of my favorites too.  Now on to the reason why I don't come here anymore despite the fact that I love the food, ambiance, and location. The service was always a miss. The bad service was the most consistent thing that they do at this location. From slow service with disappearing servers to dirty dishes that sit on the table and aren't cleared I just got fed up. Since I liked the food I kept coming back, but ultimately the bad service started to mar the experience and I just couldn't keep coming here. I can deal with mediocre service for good food, but not awful service. The tables here are tiny and the tapas style lends itself to many plates. I found that we were always trying to clean the table ourselves since nobody would clear plates. Every.single.visit. The final straw was when we came in a group at my suggestion and I felt really embarrassed for even recommending the place.  So, the food is good, but you have to be able to tolerate slow and inattentive service to enjoy yourself here."}

Then, although we were beyond ready to order our food, she disappeared for another  5mins. We were really hungry and really impatient at that point. We felt bad but we just grabbed our drinks and made our way to the bar, as she was taking way too long. The table next to us even noticed our irritation, as they sat there with the same irritation because they had been sitting for a while without service too. As we got up and moved ourselves to the bar, that table next us got up and left the establishment. We obviously told the bartender why we moved and he apologized but hardly had any urgency and the manager was even right there and she didn't even care! It was a rather lengthy late night dinner and we're definitely disappointed, as we always are when we leave Sammy's. Can't come here when I'm in a hurry that's for sure. Guess I'll stick with California Pizza Kitchen for similar menu items and much better service. Doesn't ever get any better at Sammy's unfortunately."}

There were about 8 people at the bar, the bartender said hello as we walked to our table. There were 4 tables dining.  We were told Heather would be right with us. After perusing the dinner choices on the menu Heather arrived. She asked if we would like anything to drink. I had flipped my menu over and as I was deciding between the house chardonnay and the Clos du bois Heather apparently grew impatient. She said I'll get you some waters in a clipped tone. Not more than 45 seconds had transpired since she had arrived at the table. We said water would be great thank you. She arrived back with the waters and said she would come back if we hadn't decided on entrees. We then ordered the crab and artichoke dip. She did not ask if we wanted anything other than water. I felt as though she was judging us, our appearances, and our financial status.  When she came back from placing the appetizer order I ordered a wine and we placed our dinner order. The appetizer was tasty and we enjoyed it while mulling over what Heather's issue might be. While waiting for our entrees we heard a plate clatter to the floor in the direction of the kitchen. We joked that it was one of our dinners considering the amount of time that had passed. 5 or more minutes later Heather comes to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. Ten minutes later she tells us my sliders were burnt on the outside so the kitchen was remaking them.  I work in Hospitality as a Supervisor for a large corporation and have heard every excuse for a long ticket time there is. Blaming the kitchen is a servers go-to excuse. Once the food arrived we were for the most part satisfied with it, but still slightly put off by Heather's demeanor. She was not friendly, nor did she attempt to engage in any manner. We were one of her two tables she was serving at the time. We ate quickly and when she came to clear the plates she asked if we wanted dessert. At this point I had decided against dessert not because I didn't want have dessert but because I didn't wish to be Heather's guest any longer. She brought the check, I placed my card in the book and she offered mini doughnuts to go on the house. Too little too late. I'm not saying we will not dine again because the food was enjoyable once it arrived, I am simply hopeful that should we dine again we get a server that enjoys their job and puts customer service first. We left Heather a 16% tip which was generous considering her service."}

But last night was such an exception that I felt I needed to write this poor review. First of all, they were out of skinny margarita mix.  On a Friday night??  Really??  So, I settled for a Moscow mule which showed up in the wrong glass.  Our server said it was because they didn't have any more copper mugs.  As I drank it, I found something in my ice.  It looks like the stem of something...but it was frozen in the ice....so it must have been there for a while.  The server apologized and said she would have another drink made for me.  This one showed up in the right glass!  So they were or they weren't out of them??  She explained to me that the thing in my ice was a part of the mint.  It was definetely NOT part of the mint.  But whatever...I'll move on from the drinks. The Kobe sliders were ordered medium and showed up well.  The flatbread was greasy.  The Chinese chicken salad was spicier than normal, and the New York pizza was awful.   The service was ridiculous.  We could see that she was busy and I noticed managers running food, but we were there for 2 hours and the service never got any better.  We had no silverware at one point, no water for 20 minutes.  I usually give servers a break because I used to be one....but it was bad.  Not bad enough for me to call the server out online, though. In conclusion, I won't be returning to Sammy's for a good long while.  It's too bad, too, because it used to be great.  Hope they work out their kinks soon."}

I placed the order 5 days in advance AND reconfirmed my order the following day, to ensure event day would go off without a hitch. On the day of the luncheon, Sammy's arrived 15 minutes late and delivered a completely wrong order for only TEN (10) people. I was so humiliated. All 30 executives had to CHANGE the board meeting agenda so they could eat an hour later, when the rest of my order was delivered. I then asked for a receipt for this second delivery, but Sammy's said there was no receipt since they were going to take these 3 trays of food off the bill anyway, but lo and behold, they charged my card for 2 additional trays, without me signing for the receipt. What a bunch of sneaky liars! Honestly, no monetary amount could have made up for the humiliation I endured while the CEO and the rest of the C-Level executives were waiting around for food.

Not sure why they would even think of having the guest struggle walking let alone that distance, when we were standing next to available tables. The waitress was prompt & courteous, took the order, received drinks, food was fantastic! Than she disappeared. The rest of the meal no service was to be had. Just plan awful.

I make better mac n cheese at home.  The fries are really good but make sure you order a side of ketchup or two if you like to dip it. The Kung Paw Calamari is more like steak calamari. It is really good so definitely try it. I was not impressed with the Crab & Shrimp dip. The bartender let me try the watermelon cooler which was not good. Nothing exciting about that which I was bummed cause it sounded refreshing.  It is convenient to grab a bite or a drink late night or a happy hour but not if I want a good meal.

Tonight - and as I can see from reviews on Yelp for the past five months that validates tonight's experience - service was an absolute disaster.  Appetizers took way too long to come out. When one if the managers came by to see how we were doing, I made a comment about the kitchen being backed up. He said she would find out what the delay was. Literally sixty seconds later, they came out... along with one entree. Sent that back and were told they would remake it and serve with the other entrees. Entrees came out - 4 of the 6 ordered. Ten minutes later the missing two finally came out after my husband complained to the manager.  Had to send one of the entrees back. These mishaps continued throughout the evening. Though the manager 'adjusted' our bill to compensate for all the mishaps, our semi-absentee waiter and all the other mistakes ruined the evening. And from recent reviews, these types of issues have been ongoing for months. No wonder, on a Saturday night, the place was half empty.  Please Sammy's - FIX THE PROBLEMS.

We arrive at 11:15 for our reservation and we're seated quickly. It was clear that they had understaffed. Both managers were running food and there were about 3-4 servers on the floor. It took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and after 40 mins our food arrived, cold. Imagine a cold Eggs Benedict and a asparagus scramble, not good. I will never send food back usually, but after that kind of wait, the food had better be good. We returned both our dishes to be remade, after another 20 mins our food arrived and mine was a completely different meal! It was so bad it was laughable. I sent that back and just enjoyed the side of pancakes we ordered. Sure, Sammy's removed the meal from the menu, as expected and none of this was the fault of the server, she was slammed with tables, but it's nothing short of poor management.

Meanwhile, our server took 15 minutes to initially approach us.  Water took another 10 minutes and tasted like it came straight from the faucet, although our server assured us that it was triple filtered.  One bottle of beer came to our table almost 20 after we ordered it!  Out server brought our food out without any serving utensils (we had to ask for it) and one glass of wine didn't arrive until our meal was almost finished.  Instead of checking us, he was busy chatting with his coworkers. The most insulting part of our meal was the 2 employees who were furiously sweeping the floor around us as we ate.

So when my sweet friend Jaime W. asked if she could take me here for brunch to celebrate my birthday I was stoked to check out the place so many of my Yelp friends had raved about.   This is a gorgeous restaurant! I loved the beautiful decor...  It felt like we were dining on an island somewhere. I was also excited to see that a friend was being trained as a waitress while we were there... Sometimes it can be annoying to get a trainee as your waiter or waitress, but I enjoyed getting to see a familiar face (and she didn't make any major mistakes while serving us).   As beautiful as the interior of Sammy's is, there were a few things that needed some work. I originally wanted one of the special 'handcrafted juice refreshers'  but they were unavailable. So I decided to get a mimosa, we were celebrating my birthday after all. Mimosas are listed as $8 on the menu with a $10 all-you-can-drink advertised as a Sunday special... but somehow, my single mimosa was $10.   The highlight of the meal, for me, was the adorable little donuts that we started with. They were served with chocolate and raspberry sauces and were super delicious.  The breakfast burrito I got was large, but just ok taste-wise.   Sammy's staff was generous enough to give me a free dessert for my birthday, the Messy Sundae. It  was rather cool looking but uninspired in terms of flavor and very  difficult to eat.  Overall, I enjoyed my initial visit to Sammy's enough to want to go back sometime.

I noticed they didn't have any busboys or extra staff to clean the tables. The tables around me still had dirty plates and glasses from previous diners who had left. I understand the waiters were to take orders, run the food and clean up. It's never a good idea to cut back on staff when the patrons are the ones who suffer. It's not a great way to promote your restaurant. My family of 4 had wanted a quick lunch which turned into very long experience. After waiting 15 minutes to be spoken to add another 15 till we got our drinks and then 30 minutes till we got our food, which by the way was not what we ordered.

The last time I went here they had a lot of new items and I was pretty excited about them. I tried the empanadas from the appetizers. Being Argentinian, I was interested in seeing what their interpretation of an empanada would be. Sadly, they were not very good. They were definitely not your traditional empanada. It seemed like they were frozen and heated up in a microwave. Needless to say, I won't be ordering them again. The service here is fantastic though, so I kind of wish their food matched the service.   A few tips:  If you want bread, you will have to ask for it. They don't provide it to you otherwise.  The salads here are huge, even for sharing. I would recommend getting the individual sized salad, even if you are sharing it. If you have the option, ask the hostess to seat you on the right side of the restaurant. This is where they have huge windows that brings in a lot of natural lighting."}

The BBQ pizza looked good, supposedly tasted pretty good, but not going to lie, he said he has had better pizza nearby. It was a nice portion though and smelled delicious!  The sliders got a thumbs up, but he said to go with truffle fries since the basic fries are just that. Basic. The Kobe burger was delicious (per my fellow employee) and juicy.

Nothing irritates me more in a restaurant than when I feel like a hostage (can't refill my drink, can't leave, etc) because the waiter is no where to be found!"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "TWO STARS is all you get. Reason being I am glad this location was not taken over by a pawn shop, happy ending spa or a needle exchange and also because the food is decent. I repeat. The food is decent.   My big beef with this restaurant is the service. When I say service I mean the Management.   I have been to Sammy's on three separate occasions. First time with a fellow Yelper for brunch and I had the breakfast tacos which were good. Not great, but good. Service was on point.  Second visit was at lunch time on a Sunday with my mother. It took our waitress 25 minutes to get us our drinks. I realize how long it takes to get water and how difficult it is. What was even more annoying than our waitress was the fact that they let the patrons who were sitting at the nice bar in the center of the restaurant scream at the TV during the football game. They were tossing back $10 bottomless Mimosas and obnoxiously reacting to every play and startling all of the dining customers who most of them appeared to have just come from church. Not cool especially because this restaurant has a side sports bar where they should have been directed to. Not cool especially because the Managers did nothing at all about it. The Managers stood by the bar and watched the game the entire time, too! Not my idea for a relaxing Sunday brunch. If I wanted this ruckus I would have gone to the sports book!  Third visit I really disliked a pasta dish I was sharing. Took one bite and no more. I mentioned it to the waitress and was still charged for it. Way to keep it classy, Sammy's.   NOT ONCE IN ANY OF MY VISITS DID THE MANAGERS TOUCH ANY TABLES TO SEE IF THE GUESTS WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR FOOD AND SERVICE.  Lastly, I did not want to write this review.It's my favorite time of year when I pretty much love everyone and everything.  I shared my frustration with their website directly. But, when 2 MONTHS later I did not receive anything more than a generated email response from the Sammy's website I knew I had to let the Yelp family know. I will not be playing it again, Sam I am."}

The waiter brought us a carafe of water that had no ice. The water was warm. It tasted like it was unfiltered water right out of a garden hose. Undrinkable. If this is their attempt to force restaurant-goers to all order a drink, then I'm not falling for it. I hope I never go there again."}

I attempted to address a major concern to the manager opening the huge patio doors in front of my table to accommodate another guest when the   temperature outside was 62° and our party was literally freezing, only to be addressed in such a condescending manner by the assistant manager TAMERA. This was blatant discrimination and I will never bring any guest here again!!"}

It would have been probably a good salad if everything didn't taste burnt.  It was a company lunch but this is all bad.  Then when I asked to bring it back because the chicken was burnt and salad tasted bitter they were cool about it and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes....I get there and the idiots only wanted to replace chicken only!  Nevertheless, the waitress was Pissy because I had eaten a small portion of the salad how else would I know it had tasted like burnt chicken? I got a replacement salad and when I got back to the office I got a totally different salad and wasn't what the company paid for....they are not worth the damn trouble to patronize this business again."}

However, they need a better way or space for people waiting for a table.   The ambience was very nice (Californian). Cozy.  The menu was very diverse with still the staple of Sammy's (pizzas). Boys got pizza and burger, thumbs up. Asian salad was okay. Shrimp and grits good, but have to grab some chorizo and grits for flavor. Salmon with edamame was horrible. Their idea of flavor is to layer soy sauce on the bottom of the plate. No! Deducted Star.  Service was okay. Waitress didn't seem to have a good day maybe?   Overall, service just seemed off from the time you come in the restaurant to the end of service. Deducted star.  I would go back to give it another try."}

Upon walking in, place looks unkept and unorganized. We were seated and basically just sat there for 15 minutes and no one came over nor even bothered to address us that they would be right with us. There was some clueless blonde lady walking around(who appeared to be the manager) but did not really seem to notice her staff were just meandering about aimlessly.

However, I am willing to go back again and give it another try.   We ordered the Mediterranean Appetizer, Waygu burger, pear prosciutto and arugula pizza as well as the toffee dessert.   The appetizer was delicious. I would order it again, the babaganoush and the cheese were my favorites.   The Burger - Oh how we wanted to love you. The patty was well cooked and delicious, the bun was a soggy wet mess. It literally fell apart. I will attach a pic of what the bun looked like once we got it. He ended up just eating the burger alone and taking the remains of the bun off altogether.   The Pizza- Delicious! It was a bit heavy on the cheese but I liked it.   The Dessert- It tasted pretty good however it wasn't warm at all, not even room temperature. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be warm ... I kid you not 18 minutes later she still said she had no idea. It was confirmed at the end by the chef it should have been.   Management did comp our dessert which was very nice but not necessary.   Service- Extremely slow, asked for napkins and we never got them. Had to ask for water after our glasses were empty. Our waitress was nice however she really wasn't around, Multiple people in our section complained about her. We waited about 10 minutes just to get the bill, then the waitress said she forgot and we had to wait some more.   I'm hoping we just caught them on an off day. I like the ambiance and the location is perfect. Our waitress suggested we wait a couple more weeks before returning because its crazy.   We will do just that: be back in November Sammy's."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Place is pretty big. There is 4 sections (24hr gaming bar, indoor, regular bar and a patio section). We got there on Sunday around 6/7pm and it was packed. There was no seating area so we had stand and wait to be seated.   We finally got seated after 15min, the waitress got us our beverages and took our order.   Here is what I think of this place: - slow service/barely any service - dishes that are already on the table is dirty (still had old food residue) - portion size of the pizza is a bit bigger than your typical Sammy's but it's not the same because they do not have a brick oven to cook the pizza. And they didn't use the artisan crust for the Brie cheese w truffle oil artisan crust pizza - prices are a lot higher than your typical Sammy - it took over half hour to get our food and when we got it, it wasn't even what we ordered so we had to wait some more.  - place is very loud because if the high ceiling and glass surroundings  All in all my bf and I didn't like the place. We will stick to our Sammy's on 215 and rainbow where it's just much more intimate w great customer service."}

Very crowded and had families around which made it a little loud for intimate conversation. I ordered a Lobster mac and cheese for a tapas appetizer, was not as impressed as the reviews posted said I would be. I did see a lot of them ordered. If it was half of the price it was offered at I would have been okay with it. taste wise it was good, had lumps of crab meet and a good amount of cheese. I ordered a pizza The New York Style. I thought New York style would at least be cooked through. The crust was crunchy but the middle was under cooked and doughy. not impressed. Not sure what specialty is here since their menu is all over the place. Josie had the Grilled Hawaiian Mahi Tacos. These were fresh and spicy, maybe too spicy for the spouse. I had some and I thought her choice for dinner out did mine. Overall it was nice, they were attentive which is a must. May or may not go here again.

My first time here a few weeks back was much better, even though the place was packed, we received constant, excellent service. Tonight was a totally different experience. We ordered an app and two pizzas, waited at least thirty-five minutes, app never showed. When the pizzas arrived we asked that the app be cancelled. Our server came back to say the pizzas just cooked faster than our little dumpling app (really??). I can forgive a mistake (like if someone forgets to put our app order in...) but I don't like being lied to. She proceeded to say that it was being cooked and that the manager would swing by and 'take care of it'. We never saw such manager, our server only checked on us once, and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I love the feel of this new Sammy's but one cannot live on ambiance alone. There's a small mom & pop pizza spot down the street from home that always delivers on the service front. I'd rather give them my business no matter how meager it may seem. It would have showed some good character if a manager would've showed up and simply apologized for whatever mistake was made. No need to comp anything, just own up to the mistake, apologize and move on. Very disappointed, I really wanted to love this new location."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "To be fair, this was our second time dining at the upgraded version of Sammy's on Green Valley Parkway and we will NOT BE RETURNING.  The breakfasts consist of the same Sysco-type food that every other restaurant in Henderson (and Vegas for that matter)  have to offer.  The same frozen potatoes with peppers, small eggs from GMO fed farms (organic cage-free doesn't mean gmo free) and grossly processed meat.  So save a few bucks and just dine at the Grand Cafe up the street for the same low quality.  What ever you do, don't order your eggs scrambled - it's nasty.   Not sure what mix or cream they used, but it was like eating yellow creamy foam.  Never again.  I will drive the extra miles just to get the best breakfast on earth at EAT downtown.  For a place that boasts gluten-free options, I was stunned that they didn't even offer gluten free bread for breakfast.  Their juice drinks at $4+ a clip aren't even fresh - rather they are poured from a bottle and/or the equivalent to drinking a Coke.    Cheap ingredients and originality is very low.  The pizzas could have been frozen for all I knew.  Bland and no flavor.   If you like matzo crackers, then the artisan pizzas are for you.  The salads were wilted and over poured with dressing.  During BOTH visits, the staff refused to give me box for our pizza!  They offered to box it, yet BOTH times they ruined two left over pizzas  by wrapping them securely  in aluminum foil!   Who does this?   Do they think  the toppings won't stick to the foil?  Or maybe that people with a nice car don't want food leaking???  When I asked for a box, I was told, we don't give out boxes.  Mind you, they give boxes for take out, but if you buy two of the most expensive pizzas and only eat half, you get foil.  I told her that I would pay for a box and so the waitress returned with a plastic container that was clearly too small for the pizza and said will this do? Then she walked away in a huff.   The two California investors for this restaurant standing by did nothing.  It is my hope that the CA investors who are constantly on the floor and yet strangely never  interact with patrons, will bring in a few experienced servers from California to demonstrate to Las Vegas waitstaff how the job should be done.  This i will probably only ever serve you once mentality is best left for Las Vegas Blvd."}

I didn't plan on going back, but my wife wanted to see if we might have a better experience my second time.  We did.  She really liked the sliders and I ordered a different salad (the balsamic chicken) which was quite good.  Still seemed to be understaffed though.

The pizza tasted like something you'd get at Cici's or a low chain buffet.  Completely disappointed.  We also ordered the Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad and this was ok.  The chicken was a bit burnt and dry.  We also ordered some Pork Dumplings and they were probably the best thing we ordered.  As for the service, there was some confusion on how to pay for a to-go order when I went to pick it up . . . they were nice enough about it, but just seemed like they still haven't gotten the flow of a new restaurant yet.  I looked at the other reviews and just didn't have the same experience as others had.  Maybe it was an off night . . . maybe the food doesn't hold up when you take it to go.  Maybe we need to dine in and see what we think before completely writing off this restaurant.   I do know this . . . . If I want to order Pizza to go, I would much rather get it from Metro Pizza.

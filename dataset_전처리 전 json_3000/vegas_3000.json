Yup, its' gimmicky, yup, it's high calories, but I feel like all of that should come as no surprise!   I think the theme if you will is entertaining and fun. Wearing a hospital gown was pretty funny (you get to keep it if you let the nurses spank you!), watching the nurses dole out spankings was pretty hilarious, and I loved how the bill had medical procedures rendered printed on it.   Our service was great. Friendly nurse. Food came relatively quickly. No complaints!  We started our meal with the chocolate butter cream shake and added a shot of whipped cream vodka. It turns out the shot was actually 3.5 shots, thus earning the drink the title of strongest frozen drink on Fremont. I don't know if they really are the strongest drink on Fremont, but I do know it was the TASTIEST frozen drink on Fremont. If you are childish enough to enjoy whipped cream vodka (I am!), then you will definitely appreciate the delicious combination! There was no pat of butter in my shake (which was fine by me).   We split the single bypass (1/2 pound) and an order of fries. I LOVE that they cook their fries in lard (as all fries should be cooked!), and damn were they delicious. Perfectly crisp. The burger was very good as well. Definitely not best burger in Vegas material, but a great burger.   Overall, please don't come here if you don't have a sense of humor and don't enjoy high fat food. The food tastes much better if you are drunk - in fact eating a burger wearing a hospital gown should probably only be done while intoxicated."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "The one star is for the experience only.  The food warrants a negative rating.  The only way to sum up the Heart Attach Grill is kitschy, but fun.  Unfortunately, their food doesn't live up to their slogan of taste worth dying for.  We came in expecting good food, but not gourmet.  Worst burger and fries we had ever tasted.  To start, the burgers were chard to a wonderfully grey color. I think they were as well done as leather.  They lacked seasoning and the bacon was as chewy as they precooked stuff found in the back of a supermarket.  Lard fries should be crisp and delicious, full of flavors not found at fast food or your normal burger stops. No.  They were boiled in lard, soggy and mushy, and, like the burger, lacked any seasoning and flavor.  I would have preferred to eat at a McDonald's.  People giving this place anything over 2 stars need to reevaluate what they consider to be a good burger, because better food can be had at a roach coach."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Heart Attack Grill is a hamburger joint with a zany parallel universe hospital theme.  Waitresses dress in somewhat provocative nurse outfits (The type of nurse outfits you'll see in fantasy playbacks in movies with everything all boosted up and sticking out).  Following the theme, each customer is required to wear hospital gowns upon entrance.  Their burger is eloquently named the bypass and depending on the number of patties it'll be the single, double, triple, quadruple (more if you'd like...) bypass.    When a place is called heart attack anything, it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question.  Parodied movie posters are plastered all over the walls.  While I'm no Jason Bourne, I always do a scan of any place I go too before settling in my seat.  Here my sights stopped on a rather large scale.  Above the scale was an indicator pronouncing whoever weighs 350 lbs, WILL EAT FREE!  First off, if you weigh that much, eating here may be hazardous to your health.  I was lucky enough to see a fellow customer climb onto that scale and win a free meal.  Sirens went off with applause following.    A close buddy from L.A. had been talking about trying this place out on a couple occasions.  The three of us looking at menus in hospital gowns was a sight to see.  After a couple chuckles we ordered.  The smallest of the group ended up ordering the triple bypass while I chickened out and got the double.  We all shared a side of chili cheese fries which could have fed five or more easily.  Sizes are massive and while I did finish most of it; I don't think it was a particularly good idea.  Splicing chili on top of each burger patty inserted another layer of taste to a burger that consisted mainly of overly greasy meat flavor.  Take out the notion I was clogging my arteries at an exponential rate after each bite, the burger was ok.      The novelty of it all is an experience in itself.  Seeing a couple Japanese tourists being spanked by the nurse waitresses is another interesting sight.  Rule is if you don't finish, you get spanked.  I'm assuming this was optional since any normal human would assuredly have trouble finishing these burgers and not everyone got spanked.  Aligning their extreme gimmick with the same motto of a more adult Hooter's equating to more show than emphasis on food, Heart Attack Grill is worth at least ONE visit.  I don't know about a second.  My heart may not be able to handle it."}

The gowns are fun to dress up in- they do very well with the theme. That is how they got one star from me.  However, they advertise taste worth dying for.... WTF are they smoking? There is SO MUCH potential for this place if they had decent food.   I've had my share of fatty foods. They usually taste better than skinny people food. If all fast food tasted like this, I think the obesity epidemic would be solved. No one would want to eat this crap.   This place was an embarrassment to fatty foods everywhere. Other places'  fries that are fried in animal fat= amazing. Why? Because they are crispy and delicious. They are fried first in oil and then in duck fat. HAG misses the extra step and just fries their fries in lard in lard. Lard burns at too low of a temperature and cannot FRY fries.  HAG fries are limp, soggy, and burned ( AND luke warm). Gross.  The burger... 59 cent dry stale bun + overcooked basically unseasoned meat + bacon that was chewy and luke warm (somehow it was stale too) = disappointment.   It's not even a tiny bit delicious. It is disgusting and they don't even try. The whole restaurant is constantly advertising how amazing the food is and how it's food worth dying for. No- it's definitely worth avoiding though."}

It was campy before with its sexy nurses and absurdly large burgers and the policy about getting to eat for free if a person weighs more than 350 pounds. Yeah, this all carried over.   Now you are required to wear a hospital gown they provide and if you don't finish your meal, you're forced to stand in front of a camera while one of the nurses strikes you with a paddle from behind, recording your every facial expression. Honestly, it at times got disturbing. The loud WHACKS against people's backsides would pervade throughout the room while everyone watched and strangers shot video with their phones. It wasn't playful spanking; these ladies were really winding up and letting the paying customer who dared utter, I'm full, have it.    There's much more alcohol than there was before with the option of getting it in prescription bottles, IV drips, and syringes. This is probably the only fun aspect that I'm glad they achieved here, which I didn't see when it was one state over. Granted, it's definitely not cheap to drink here.   Again, the food just wasn't up to snuff. It didn't have the same flavors, it was greasier (which I guess they were aiming for), and things like the chili fries were overdone and dried out. Maybe they figured the chili would disguise it or compensate?   It's pretty cheesy and if you're easily offended, steer clear of it, but with sensibilities like those what would you be doing walking around Vegas?"}

I thought the burger was good - with a fresh bun, good meat and garnishes.  Even the minimal single burger is big, my wife could only eat half of her burger.

The burgers are always satisfying and filling. The fries are cooked to lard perfection and the shakes are so delish. I love the atmosphere and theme of the restaurant. You get admitted and have to wear a hospital gown. If you don't finish (burger at least) the seductive friendly nurses spanky you. Dr. Jon is a true genius and visionary. This restaurant has the potential to last years in Fabulous Las Vegas. Especially being at the center of Neonopolis on Fremont. The location is perfect.

I didn't get any fries but my man did and they were decent. I wasn't expecting the burger to be that good honestly. I ate it all and so did my man. We did however witness allot of people getting spanked for not finishing their meals. Plus you can ask to be spanked even if you do finish your meal. We skipped that option. One poor guy got the sh*t beat out of him because he said after the 1st spank that it didn't hurt at all. Well after she was done with him he looked like he could cry. Everyone is watching while they do this too. They have cute movies playing of the waitresses reenacting popular shows. The star wars one was the best. The décor is clever as well. Two single burgers, one fry and two waters we were out of there for about $26.00. Great price for the food and the entertainment. Later I didn't feel like I over ate either.

The nurses spank them really hard - it's funny to see who yelps in pain and who just takes it. It looks like they don't spank women - the woman at the table next to us couldn't finish her burger and our waitress assured her she wouldn't get spanked but her husband would have to take it for her!  If you weigh over 350 lbs, your burger is free, you just have to get on the massive scale to prove it.

It was a mighty fine burger. E and I came to the decision that in our burger eating lives thus far, we've had a majority of mediocre burgers,  a few downright not so good burgers, and even less good to great burgers. This was suprprisingly good. Moist, meaty, tasty, and all on a really great bun from a local bakery. I thought it was a potato bun but our nurse (server) didn't know for sure. Their chili chese fries were a great compliment to the burger, shoestring fries with what seemed like a 'no bean hot dog kinda chili' chili. I'm not sure what brand was used but that too was yummy; one of the better ones.  The floor entertainment was hilarious and I'm sure painful. Although, do you really feel any pain if you are swimming in an alcoholic fog? The tiny nurses literally wound up to swat a fellow three times for not finishing his meal. One even swatted the guy on the same cheek  each time - ouch!  All in all a grand time...good burger...great friends. Next time someone suggests venturing out this way, I will not be a naysayer."}

There was a nameless character on the show who just happened to be a buxom blonde nurse.Whenever Yakko would come across said nurse he would shout out his catchphrase, HELLOOOOO NURSE!  That began my obsession/fetish/whatever with girls in nurses outfits.I'm not talking about those lame scrubs that nurses wear nowadays(screw you male nurses for ruining the way that nurses dress now), but the white outfits and hat little white hat with the red cross on it.To this day, whenever I come across an attractive woman that phrase echoes through my head.I sometimes find myself imagining what a girl will look like in a nurse's outfit before deciding to approach her.Relationships have been ruined due to this obsession(why aren't more women into roleplaying?).Anyway...  The Present:  I find out there is a new restaurant opening up on Fremont Street that serves frighteningly unhealthy food and the waitresses are dressed like nurses....I'm there, dude.

The fries were pretty damn good.I have no clue what lard is supposed to taste like but it works well with fries.Apparently, the bun and meat of the burger are also coated with lard.Lardopalooza up in here.  Something about this burger was just not right.The cheese looked like it had been placed onto the burger the moment it had been handed to me, the onions had the texture of worms(Yes, I've eaten worms before.)Normally when one bites into a really good burger, you get that burst of flavor in your mouth that makes you pity vegetarians.I did not experience that here.  As I continued to eat, I gazed up at the video wall and saw the sign(Throwing out an Ace of Base reference).The video shows the owner in a doctor's outfit and two nurses shopping for supplies at a Sam's Club/Costco warehouse store.He pushes the 2 nurses around on a cart and comes to the meat section.Now it all makes sense.They buy all their product from a fucking Costco!sigh...

But, I tried to be a bit lighthearted about the issue during our vacation. I have to admit that this place did an excellent marketing job (e.g., eating free if you weigh over 350 pounds, interesting posters on the walls, waitresses' nurse uniform, customers wearing a hospital gown). HOWEVER, after all, this is a restaurant where people go eat. After looking at the menu, there was nothing I wanted to eat there. My husband ordered a chilly hot dog with french fries and soda. The food came out, and it was disgusting. French fries were all burnt. My husband took two bites and he couldn't eat it, and I didn't blame him. Who could? We saw a young guy who got spanked by a waitress because he didn't finish his burger as a punishment. Basically, we paid $20 as an admission fee to this restaurant for the entertainment.

The menu is pretty basic, a nurse will bring you it. You choose a burger depending on the topping and patties you want. As well as any extras such as drinks and fries. And the Doctors cook it to perfection. Eat, keep your gown on until a nurse takes it off, and finish your food. There are two reasons for this...The first, there's no take out here. You either eat it or leave it. If you can't finish it, reason two: You'll be punished! A few slaps on the butt by a gorgeous nurse sounds nice. Until you end up like me, I wasn't even able to finish a regular by-pass burger. So I was given the paddle and trust me they don't hold back on those who can't finish their food! But at least they give you a nice hug afterwards~ makes you forget the sting on your behind.

We got a seat right by the slapping bar where people got their butts smacked when they don't finish their food (and those girls don't hold back either). That's enough motivation to clean up your plate.  The decor is cleverly done too. The TV plays a variety of music videos, some even customized to the Heart Attack Grill, including one wtf? one with a little person and Ron Jeremy lip-synching to Summer Lovin' from Grease.   I love the little menu touches too. If you ask for lettuce they say we don't have anything green. They don't serve diet drinks either because, why bother? They DO have cane sugar soda which was actually really cool, and somewhat ironic because people would argue real sugar might even be healthier than the usual High Fructose Corn Syrup. If you order wine it comes in an IV and the receipt lists tax as government theft. It's all very clever.  The burgers themselves were actually quite impressive, even the dinky one-patty burger. For $10 it's actually a reasonable deal considering you'll pay that much anywhere else, and the burgers are a good size. You can easily split a burger if you're worried about not finishing one. I got fries too and even though they were fried in deep lard, they didn't really taste any different.  I'm glad I went, but I don't see myself going back again anytime soon. It's probably not a place you'll go regularly (unless you are over the 350 lb mark). Also keep in mind that it is CASH only and they do not let you bring in outside drinks, including water."}

Look at the name of the place and you'll find your answer that this is an UNHEALTHY place to eat.  It's part of the gimmick and as this is in Vegas, it's a good tourist attraction that is made to go against the politically correct attitude regarding obesity in today's society.  They advertise on their windows some of the most politically incorrect deals:  Morbidly obese people over 350 pounds eat for free.  And yes, they have cigarettes on their menu, but only unfiltered.    As soon as you walk in, scantily-clad waitresses in nurse uniform greet you and put a hospital apron around you.  You'll see a scale in the middle of the room and can get the nurses to weigh you, if you're near the 350 lb threshold. You're met with music from the 70's and get to take a look at their pro-obesity menu.  Again, these meals are not meant for its taste, but I take it that they try to make everything as fattening and unhealthy as possible to fit the style.  The menu is simple and the burgers come in four different sizes: A single, double, triple, and quadruple with each patty being 1/2 a lb!  I got a single 1/2 lb hamburger (they do not allow you to share any of the bigger burgers) and this was definitely the tastiest thing on the menu. I also got a ButterFat(this is the actual name) shake, fries, and a coke. The burger comes with a thick slice of cheese, tomatoes,  grilled onions, and about 5 strips of bacon.  No vegetables here at all!    Wasn't a big fan of the fries though.  Probably because they proudly proclaimed that they were doused in animal lard before being fried.  It was just too soggy and was as if i were chewing on a soft block of cooking oil.    The shake wasn't all too good either.  They use only cream and garnish is with a slice of butter on top.  I understood why it was called ButterFat though.  Because it was like eating a mashed up stick of butter.  I couldn't eat it, neither could anyone else that I came with  I did like their old school styled Coke though, where they use a glass bottle with actual sugar instead of corn syrup.  Really sugary, but delicious.  I did notice that it was just imported from Mexico however.  No harm in that though.  So my suggestion is if you come here, don't put your hopes on having a good meal.  Come with some friends, take some pictures, and get ready to play along.  And the experience is what earns this place three stars.  Good setting and overall mediocre food (but delicious burgers)."}

They have the strongest daiquiri, cigarette candy, animal-fat fries, etc. Yeah, I don't mind indulging on those things in moderation but when I do, it better be damn good. The burger was so bland, I asked for a side of pickles to help slither that overcooked mess down my throat but the owner doesn't like pickles so he does not offer it in his restaurant. Pffft!  The only thing this place has going for them is it's gimmicky, touristy and tacky. I highly doubt they have any repeat customers besides the morbidly obese that get to eat for free.

A restaurant that can thoroughly stick to there theme is a wonderful place to go.  They dress you up in hospital gowns, the food is directed towards the theme as well as the alcohol.  The waitresses at this restaurant love there job you can tell.I had an AMAZING waitress named Rianna who I would recommend to anyone who is going to talk to her. She was so down to earth and wonderful.  They do Karaoke there as well which isn't the main attraction and just kind of added but it is okay. I also don't know how I feel about congratulating people who are over 350 pounds with a free meal but it was cool seeing people get weighed and the scale.  I didn't eat but all they have is burgers and fries. Instead I decided to stick to drinks. I love that the Jello shots are in an actual syringe and are huge! I love that the only option you can get is red for the blood. My Mom got wine and the only option is to get a bottle of wine in an IV bag so that is what she got!

I understand we are in vegas and everything in the tourist areas is expensive, I get it really.  BUT when i'm paying close to 20 bucks for a cheeseburger with 6 strips of bacon, I expect 6 strips, not 2 strips broken into 3 pieces each, cmon.  Same thing regarding sodas n water, really?  I can buy a bottle of water on the bridges n bring it with me next time I guess lol.  Overall service/food quality were par at best, and they were slow.  Burgers were hammered and Im pretty sure our waitress was too.  She spent most of her time wiping down the same table, over and over, or just kinda lookin off into space.

Service was okay, not particularly stellar.  They do make you agree to the rules before you are allowed into the restaurant.  The milk shake was the best part of the meal, and i am not a big fan of ice cream or milkshakes in general.  The burger (a single bypass with bacon) was huge, but tasteless.  The onion rings were doughy and undercooked.  The hot dog one of our party ordered was huge, and probably the biggest success of the meal.  We saw three individuals weigh in over 350 pounds during our meal, which was enough to make me lose my appetite.  I only managed 4 bites of the burger, but got out without a spanking.  It's fun to say we've been here, but certainly won't go back, and i can only recommend it based on the kitschy idea."}

HAHA   This is definitely a novelty place, I don't think I could eat here to many times, if at all again.   If your over 350lbs you get your meal for free. LOL  So my friend ordered a Triple Burger with everything and I ordered a Double Burger with everything. In addition, we ordered the chili fries and there hot dog which seemed like 2lbs. Everything on it, has chili, cheese, onions and tons of bacon.   This was a mistake, we could have easily split the double burger. My buddy ate about a 3/4 of the triple which was a great accomplishment, each patty seemed like 1/3 of a lbs, if not more. Very tall and big, big burgers.   I ate almost half of my burger, for me it was a little too meaty, but was pretty good overall. The hot dog was really good, we split that. I could have had half of the hot dog and been perfect. But we went there to be pigs and try everything there. I had maybe one fry as I could not eat anymore.   You can't customize your burger, you can only leave ingredients off, I wanted chili on the side, but they said they couldn't do that. The chili looks like it can cause some serious damage, next day in the bathroom, just saying. HaHa  So if you go there, you can easily split a burger with someone, unless you are a super eater, then I recommend getting a burger just for yourself.   But for the novelty of it, you should try one burger on your own.. They make you wear hospital gowns when your eating in there, this is kind of funny and strange at the same time, but it's going along with the theme of everything.   They were spanking people in there that didn't eat all their food, it was quite humorous as they really spank them hard, a paddle broke when I was in there. LOL  I will definitely go back there with someone who has never been there, for the experience."}

It starts off with a scale outside the front door to weigh yourself; you know what kind of food you're getting into. Right when you enter, they put you in a hospital gown and tag you a with medical wrist band. Heart Attack has a Quentin Tarantino type twist to a medical facility, but with a food emphasis theme. There are nice artwork everywhere that changes famous pics to their own food version (look at some of the photos that people have taken). The waitresses dress up as hot nurses and the guy behind the bar, looks like a doctor. Alcoholic shots come in prescription bottles. Portions here are huge! They have up to a Octuple Bypass Burger (8 X 1/2 lbs beef paties, lettuce, red onions, cheese, gourmet sauce, tomato, and 40 bacon slices optional). Chili dog tastes like the chili burger except with a big hot dog meat of course. Fries are deep fried and lard and just taste greasy; chili fries are even more greasy. They even put a slice of butter in your shakes. Be careful what you order though because if you don't finish your food, they will spank you! No sharing allow except for the smallest level items and they will hit you really hard with a wooden paddle, 3 times :/. Being elite, of course I finished my burger/hotdog ;). A girl yelled out for her mommy, a guy ran and almost cried after being spanked. Overall, a fun place to visit and check out when in Vegas."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "We went to Heart Attack Grill for pure gluttony and it delivered. I expected it to be all gimmick, but I was pleasantly surprised that I did in fact enjoy the burger and fries.   I only had the single bypass, but others had the triple with bacon. Bun to meat ratio is quite good on the single. Great cheese and carmelized onions. My only complaint is that you have no choice on the temperature, all burgers are well done. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but I'd never request one well done. Considering its how this one comes it's pretty good. The bacon is very good if you choose to get it. Fries remind me of those I got as a kid. I prefer crisp and fluffy on the inside, but while these are a bit limp they have great flavor. I didn't have the shake, but a friend did. It was so filling he only finished half and had no room for his burger. It's thick like custard and the pat of butter is just a square that can easily be taken off.   I expected my visit to be a one time deal, but I would return. Note that it is cash only. A single bypass with bacon and fries will cost less than eleven bucks. Don't forget a drink and tip.  Come with a big appetite and sense of humor. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}

But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said Let me ask upon returning she said No sorry I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke. Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says'  In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!! I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food. At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what  you started it when you asked for a discount I was like What? He then says I cant stand the F ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the S out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man. BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED.

As far as the people in the place, they let me take pictures and were really friendly... That kind of speaks volumes in itself that I wasn't even giving them money and they were just overall very nice.  Maybe if I become a super fat guy I'll eat here.. you know.. to end it all.

Food was great VERY FILLING if you don't finish you'll get a spanking. It's all burgers and hotdogs. Sides as well as drinks and alcohol. Sodas only come in glass bottles and wine comes in an i.v beer comes in a glass. And no lite beer or brand beer. All beer they make. Waitress's dress up as nurses and doctors. If you are over 350 your burger is free. They have a scale. If you don't want to get spanked then you have to sing Karaoke. Over all this place is great and I would go back."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Despite the list of bad reviews and limited stars, I decided to try Heart Attack Grill  anyways for its amazing concept.  Talk about a place with giant weight scales, hospital gowns for its consumers, waitresses in skimpy nurse outfits, XL wheelchairs, witty pop art that grace the walls and an unbelievable shout out to all 350lb heavy-weighters who can dine for free! Sounds like fun... Sounds like Vegas!  With a name like HAG, I'm definitely not dinging them for how much fat is packed into their food.  Coming out of this joint in a state of food-coma and lard oozing out of your pours is a given.  Call me self-righteous, but I'm dinging them because I felt that there was no content that backed their concept.   I would expect that the unhealthiest burger known to mankind would also be the tastiest.. but their claim to fame simply did not meet my expectations.  The burger bun was stale and dry, not even a trace of flavor could be found on the patty and the burger altogether along with the grilled onions, bacon and cheese was a $7 bunch o' bull. Another on my hit list was the fries (deep fried in lard) with cheese and chili.  Again, I have no animosity against the lard.. it was the fact that they had the nerve to call the item chili-cheese fries!  The chili had the texture of diarrhea and the oil drenched, browned, curdled fries were more saturated in lard then fried.  Once again, not a trace of flavor.  If you are coating your meal with catsup and mustard, you know you have a problem.  Props to their extensive beer line-up, but if you are not into drinking, your only choices are glass bottled coca-cola and/or bottled water which will run you about $3+.    The service was good, quick and easy.. but if you are in a skimpy nurses outfit dressing your patients in hospital gowns, I would've expected a little bit more enthusiasm from the servers as they are constantly bombarded with an array of one-liners from the customers like, Hellllloooo Nurse! Do I need to bend down for this examination? But they themselves seemed bored out of their minds as if one too many puns came along their way.  Once again.. Flavorless. One and done!"}

If you're reading this review, and you're thinking about going here, either (A)  You're looking for entertainment value, or (B) You have a death wish.    If it's (A), you won't be disappointed, it's fun.  Staff dressed up as Doctors and Nurses (naughty nurses that adminster shots), entertaining menu's, mandatory hospital gowns, parody posters on the walls, they even produced their own video news clips.  Marketing guys get 5 stars.  If it's (B), IMO it would take quite a few Quadruple Bypass burgers to off yourself.  Just my opinion, your experience may vary.  I had the Quadruple Bypass, and other than a mild food coma, experienced no ill effects.  The food is OK.  Burger was good, and the bacon was excellent.  The fries?  Well, let's just say there's a reason fries aren't typically fried in lard.  My wife ordered the fries and didn't even finish them.  My pet peeves:  they won't serve you tap water, you have to purchase bottled water.  If you ask for water, they'll just bring you a bottle of water.  Boo.  Pet peeve #2:  they won't let you split a burger.  Naturally, everyone wants the Quadruple Bypass Burger, 'cuz it's the bomb.   Just let people split it and charge a split fee.  I didn't really want to eat that, but I did.  Just to get the full experience.   Judged strictly on quality of food, this place is two stars.  Judged on entertainment value, it's four stars.  Am I glad I went?  You betcha.  Would I go again?  Probably not.  If a bunch of friends were going, would I come along?  Sure."}

Upon entering you are given a hospital gown. That instantly puts you in a the mood to chow down. The staff is dressed like nurses. And there's a few people in scrubs. The decorations are hilarious and just add to the scene.  Definitely going to come back here every time I go to Vegas. I order the single bypass burger and fries just to be safe (no spankings over here). But I think I can definitely finish a double bypass the next.   This is a place that you go to with good friends.

I had the hotdog and butter chocolate shake. The hotdog even though packing an absurd amount of calories was just super salty but bland tasting. The shake however was pretty good if you can get past the big tab of butter floating in your shake! My wife had the double by pass burger and fries and she said that she prefer 5 guys over it and the fries again was kinda marginal not not delivering on taste even with the gargantuan amount of calories it enstowed. The reason I give two stars is because it was kinda fun watching patrons of the resturant  getting paddled by the waitress and watching the reactions of the customers. Wearing the hospital gown is not optional btw so be prepared to donn one! Enjoy."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I heard about this place on the news and so I wanted to give it a try and see if it was taste worth dying for as they claim. Unfortunately, it's really not. The burger and fries I got were decent, but not anything special. And service was not that good.  I just ordered a single bypass burger and it was moist, but not juicy. And the fries were brown and really needed salt to taste good. They were rather flimsy and really nothing special, even if they are in fact cooked in lard.  As for service, it wasn't the worst, but it could've been better. The hostess at the front really looked miserable and like she didn't want to be there. The nurse who served me at my table was okay, but after she took my order I waited around 20 minutes for a burger and fries! Other people who had been in there before me were waiting as well, and then finally everybody's food all came out at the same time. The nurse did check on me once, but otherwise she was just mingling with the others as well as the doctor throughout the night. The place was rather empty, too!  What makes this place interesting aside from the obvious hospital theme is the fact that they show music videos of some classic old hits on the big screen. I also thought it was cute how on the receipt, the restaurant was referred to as a diet center and the tax was called Obama's cut.  I was hoping to be blown away when I decided to try this place that warns people that it's bad for your health. Unfortunately, I found that I can get a better burger elsewhere and similar fries without the artery clogging, or upset stomach that I felt a bit later on that evening. In short, not worth the hype or price."}

Yes it was funny to sit in a hospital gown, but unless you were there for jello shots and hard core drinking, the waitresses wouldn't pay any attention to you. It took us 15 minutes to get our drink order and then longer to get our actual order. I just got a single burger and fries and let me tell you after eating that food i wanted to vomit.   The fries were rock hard and not good at all for something fried in lard. The burger might have been okay if the chili wasn't on it because it tasted like powdered chili (aka vomit). Definitely not quality food and they make their money off the atmosphere. I couldn't  even finish my food, so my boyfriend had so shove it down so I didn't get spanked. But we COULD NOT finish those gross fries. Didn't get a spanking because it was clear how upset we were. As the slow service theme continued to get our check, we walked out of there with that burger sitting in our stomach's for hours."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "This was my first time in Vegas and me my wife and two year old son decided on the last day of the memorial weekend we would check out the Fremont downtown strip. We looked at the heart attack grill and thought WOW what a cool place to eat. BOY WAS I WRONG!. We had to wait over 20 Min's just to be seated which was OK because the place was busy and a tourist attraction. But after we were seated our waiter messed up a large groups order so it took him 20 Min's to even notice us. After we flagged him down he made us wait another five Min's then finally took our order. He brought our water $1.84 a piece because they don't offer free water and then placed our order. The waiter checked in on us 10 Min's later assuring us that we would get our order in five minutes but by this time he took another group of 15 foot ball players. so we had to wait for him to take all their orders and while it was taking a long time another waitress had to bring over the order for us.  I ordered a double bypass and my wife ordered a single by pass. Both our burgers were dry and burnt my wife took three bites of her burger and she then said that this was enough. I only took one bite of mine. WE DECIDED TO GETUP AND LEAVE. I told the waiter that his service was horrible and that we were not going to pay. He then ran to the bar counter where the manager was and began to tell him the situation. This guy dressed as the head doctor pretty much said well this is the way that they are made and there is no way that we would get our money back because we ate the food. I told him that this was BS. he then threatened me to call the Security and I had to pay for it or go to jail for a Misdemeanor. I told him to take off half the food and paid for something I didn't enjoy.  Moral of the story kids is if you want to be treated badly and have a long wait and over pay then go to this place but if your looking for at least one star service then don't come here at all save your money. We went across the street to the Irish pub and they gave us another burger and even gave us free soda because we were treated badly. I give this place the big TWO THUMBS DOWN~!"}

(The only actual smile the waitresses had)  2. The prices are high! with extremely low quality food.  3. I got the single bypass with bacon and chili and the burger was as extremely overdone and the chili had the consistency of diarrhea with the taste of blended Walmart brand chili while the fries were soggier than I thought possible.They also only serve bottled drinks here. So no you can't have a glass of water.   Within 20 of eating here my entire group of 8 people had to run to the Golden Nugget to take emergency dumps!   Why would you go here!! Don't GO HERE! STOP!!

Yes complaining about cash only is fair because it shows what a greasy cheap under the table establishment this is.(oh bookkeeping and 3% is too expensive for this obvious cheaply ran place)  That is an inconvenience as someone that messaged me complained about this review.

Upside is the shakes with brownie chunks in it is heavenly!! Its also freaking huge. Along with the single bypass burger.

We were seated immediately but Heart Attack Grill got busy very fast. Once you enter, guest must put on a hospital style gown. I got a single bypass burger/fries.These burgers are massive and calorized out. It's part of the experience of going to one of the world's unhealthiest restaurant. The burger and fries were decent. It wasn't the best ever or worst. I was surprised it was decent. The waitresses are dressed as nurses. I dreaded getting spanked for not finishing my food (lol). The table food was put on me.

Our nurse didn't have much of a personality comparred to the others we saw that were more engaged with their patients.  Ours may have been new and just a little shy.  We sat not far from the scale and saw a couple of skinny people get on it for a laugh.  They have DJ.  I don't know why everyone is saying they don't serve bottle water - I got it. My only complaint was that they didn't have fountain drinks with ice.  I really wanted a Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb but the machine was broken.  I did get a coke in a glass bottle and got a straw.  I got the single bypass and my husband got the double.  The burgers were served within 5 minutes of waiting.  They were EXCELLENT.  The cheese had a very good flavor and the fries were very crispy.  We did witness two people get the 8000 calorie burger; 1 was a very large man and the other 1 was a little guy who ordered it for a good laugh.  They also had a really nice bar area too.  It seemed a little dead in there but we did eat around 5PM.  I think they need to add credit card machines and fountain drinks and that is why I am giving three stars.  I have to say it was an excellent burger and I loved the cuteness of the creativity of the Doctor.  I wish the Doctor nothing but success.  We don't want another practice in Vegas to close down."}

That's a rarity in the valley, the biggest advancement of all ages shows on the strip was in the earliest incarnation of Gameworks, when it had the climbing structure in the coke bottle.   Would Jillian's replacement be worthy? I went in with a big open mind, which is necessary here.  First thing you notice outside is, how do I put it nicely? Well, they didn't. It's not a truck scale. It's to weigh those that challenge it's 350 lb. mark. If you're heavier than that, you get to eat for free, the details of which I'm not sure of. I'm guessing it's not for a side salad.  Since I didn't have much time, I decided to go in for a PBR and because I was reluctant to binge in a place that encouraged it on this level.   A new place has a lot to take in factor when you enter, must be a board of tourism rule more than a one of fine dining. Before you can visually climatize a couple of hostesses (let's face it, there's no hosts in a breastaurant) put a cloth gown on you. You realize everyone is dressed this way. Is that their form of a bib?   They put a strap on your wrist, get it it's like a hospital patients'?! There are Vegas restaurants that want you to advertise to other tourists where you've been. Where did they get that big white paper hat? We have to eat there!(?) Where'd they get that guitar you can drink from? Let's go there!  They hand you a menu, that lets you know you can buy it on the cover. I sat at the bar because I love bar service for several reasons. At this bar, there's a doctor bartender. I could focus on the carnival that unfolds in this place.   There's a lucky strike cigarette machine (unfiltered). There are servers dressed in tight cleavage nurse outfits. If you're eating here, chances are you've heard about the people who have actually died that have had some connection to the place. While other businesses would shun this, this place advertises it. A local has their ashes on the bar and I heard the bartender tell his story 4 times the time I was there. For 1 beer.  With a wooden paddle, nurses actually spank guys that don't finish their burgers, so you better not have to pee or crap if you can't finish. See how funny it is that a cute nurse gets to spank a guy while you eat dinner?   They offer 4 burgers for their menu, the difference being the number of patties. They took a cue from the success of In-n-out burger's minimal menu. But at least HAG offers pickles, bacon and mustard.   On the walls there are  a lot of collages of images, 3 kinds: 1) towards the bathroom, there are all kinds of classic pieces of art with a HAG modification of it, maybe to appeal to higher class, patrons? 2) on the far back wall are pop movie posters, each has a HAG modification, to appeal to 20-30 somethings, get it? 3) a mural on the far wall of the last supper, and the participants are fast food mascots eating with a doctor from HAG, to appeal to kids, get it?   It's a big lesson in ad marketing, mix your brand with successful, well known symbols as if to be endorsed by them, using them under the copyright loophole of spoofing. Star Max Wars, get it? With Luke Maxwalker.   This place seems to cater to the bachelor/ette crowds, as well as the people that give the guy they know that coughs with their smoking problem a pack of cigarettes. It's based on peer dares, weather or not you can handle it.  Yeah, I got the jokes. And in Vegas, I certainly have handled many challenges of unsafe drinking, drugs and sexual uh... This place is crawling with gimmickry and I just felt like I was in front of planet hollywood, with all the ads yelling at me with flashy lights and people sticking fliers in my face.

Upon checking into the Heart Attack Grill, nurses slap a wristband and cotton gown on you before escorting you to the cafeteria, where all the other patients are dining.   The bf and I shared the single bypass burger + 5 strips of bacon (+ $1) (we can't share the double, triple, or quadruple), but ordered our own drinks. His choco milkshake had a piece of butter swimming in it, I had a Mexican coke in a glass bottle. The burger was bland and dry... luckily the bacon saved the flavor for me to finish my half of the burger. The fries were just as dull in flavor. For food cooked in lard, one would think there would be more taste... after all, we're splurging on the calories already... may as well make it savory!  A cheap meal that can only be forked out in ca$h, but if you forget, don't fret, because the ATM in the restaurant charges a mere $0.75 service fee (unheard of and practically free in Vegas!)   The meal was entertaining and all the patients were in high spirits, completely unlike a true hospital cafeteria. I would not return for their outrageously unhealthy and tasteless food, but this is a fun tourist trap for daredevils to try :) (those who finish the quadruple bypass get rolled out in a wheelchair)"}

I thought this would be the perfect place to go out with a bang.  I knew it would be a gimmick kind of place before arriving.  I had seen it on TV.  I had read some reviews.  I was unaware of the hospital gown as required attire.  I kind of got a kick out of that.  I was joking with the nurse about it feeling  draft up my back side.  After being seated the nurse explained the procedures.  My order was placed quickly via cell phone in the nurses hand.  I ordered a single bypass burger with bacon, a coke and a side of fries.  Fries were not served with as one reviewer has stated.  They were an extra $2.  When my food arrived (after being apologized to for the delay numerous times), I noticed my burger with lettuce, tomatoe, pickes, cheese and bacon.  Again, different than a previous review.  I squirted on some mustard, ketchup and mayo then noticed only three slices of bacon rather than the advertised five.  I mentioned it to the nurse and she brought a bascket of extra bacon.  I don't think I was charged for it.  Bonus.  The burger was good.  Not fantastic.  It was big and filling.  I think I would struggle with a double or larger.   The taste was good.  The meat was charred on the outside with a bit of crunch yet still juicy on the inside.  The fries were not my style.  I never use ketchup on fries but needed to this time.  They had a burnt taste and little salt.  It reminded me of In-N-Out Fries.  Over all, this is a fun place to visit once.  The service was good.  The atmosphere was interesting.  The food was OK.  I don't plan on going back unless some out-of-towners would like to try it for the novelty it brings to the Vegas experience."}

It was sad that Texas was all over the Top 10 list of folks with high blood pressure. We ordered one burger to split, fries and Coke. Actually pretty good but there were much cheaper options in the area. I would return if we had friends with us who are new to the Vegas experience."}

We ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.    While we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.    He arrogantly asked what's the problem, in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said, leave then!    The girl responded, you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?  The so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth.  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.    I thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to, he had to cowar back and close the door.    I wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.   The owner made the situation worse and made himself look like a coward."}

This place is damn unique.  -=-Quadruple Bypass Champ-=- Yep you heard it. I downed the 8000 calories in one sitting. Sure, the 270 mile ride home wasn't fun, but you gotta pay to play. Most might say so much quantity that it can't possibly taste good, but let me tell you....the tastiness of the patty is really what got me through this. It's no frills cooked to tenderness perfection, with a slathering of cheese melted on. No charcoal mess, no gimmicks, just good ol' food. My technique was to divide and conquer where I essentially made 2 doubles. When I knocked down that tower of meat, the sense of accomplishment was monumental. I looked over at my partners' burgers and juices were just spilling down, but my plate, no messy droppings. All technique! At the end of the meal, I was wheeled out to my car in a hospital robe by my buxom nurse server. I was King of the World this day. King of the Toilet that night."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I'm a local. I've passed over this place many a time laughing at the gimmickry involved in keeping this place open. It's so absurd as a concept that it's entertaining. In earnest, when my father told me this was where we were eating that day for lunch, I began to talk him out of it. But it was his day and I suspect he was going for the nursing outfits.  To start with, you're required to keep on the hospital gowns. It's a cute gimmick but annoying when you're wearing a sweater. The menu is unsurprisingly limited. Giant hot dogs or build your size burger with fried sides. The prices are inexplicably high unless you want to add unnecessary amounts of bacon. For some reason, adding bacon costs about a buck.  The beer selection is a choice of three overpriced cans. Or you can go for soda or the gimmick IV alcohol or Jell-O shot syringe to name a few.   A highlight is the overall gimmick in itself. The movie poster adaptations are interesting scenery. The homemade music video interpretations are both fascinating and disturbing. The nurses are cute in their skimpy costumes, but there are plenty of restaurants in Vegas with barely clad girls and tasty food.  And that brings us to the heart of the review: the food. The single bypass burger was not just incredibly unhealthy (as advertised) but genuinely terrible. It wasn't just sautéed in lard; it was brutalized by it. It was so overdone I complained to the waitress. Her response was, if you don't finish, you get spanked. I attempted to explain that parts of the patty were burnt and she eventually replaced it with something eerily similar. This was definitely not a burger worth dying for. It's not even a burger worth paying for. The onion rings and fries were plentiful, but again, generally terrible. I get the gimmick of wanting to pack calories into each meal. But doing so to sacrifice flavor goes against the entire purpose of a restaurant. You can do high calorie artery clogging decedent food that tastes good.    Heart attack grill's problem is that it is more money making gimmick than restaurant. It's the culinary equivalent of cow tipping."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "On a recent trip to Vegas, one of my guy friends suggested we try Heart Attack Grill. Wait, let me reiterate, he INSISTED we eat there. I hadn't heard of it before and didn't know what to expect. We arrived about 9pm ish.   Outside of the restaurant there is a huge scale that entices drunk people to weigh themselves for all of Freemount St. to see. There's also a neon sign saying if you weigh 350lbs or more you eat for free. Foregoing getting on the scale, we walked in and was immediately accosted by nurses in tight & revealing uniforms, who put us in hospital gowns and gave us hospital wrist bands. Now I know why my friend wanted to come here, the nurses....not to worry girls, the doctors are equally hot.  Stephanie was our server and she was really friendly. There were 6 of us. Everyone ordered the Single By-Pass Burger with a side of fries except for one who decided on the ginormous Chili Dog. While looking at the menu, it said if you didn't finish your menu, the nurses would spank you. Deciding I didn't want to get spanked, my friend and I decided to share the single. We ordered a couple of shakes to share. Wasn't too keen on the calorie count it claimed but, it was pretty good.   We also ordered the peniscillin Jell-O shots. It actually comes out in the shape of a....., well, I'll pass on the graphics and let your imagination go to the dark place. The peniscillin shot is filled with white jello and is like a needle shot you'd get at the doctors's office. Let's just say they aren't served in glasses, you shoot it in your mouth. I would've posted pics but I'll keep this G-rated.   The food was nothing special, it's just a burger loaded with bacon and a ton of calories. It was cooked to my liking and I'm so glad I shared with my friend because I could barely finish it.   My friend who ordered the chili dog wasn't able to finish his. I pointed out that he was about to get his booty spanked...woot woot and he literally started getting nervous. I actually didn't think they'd spank people but it was fun teasing the drunk guy. He tried to get us to help him but we refused. He tried swapping his basket with another friend who had finished his meal. I reminded him Stephanie would probably remember he ordered the chili dog since he's the only one who ordered it on our table. He said there was no way they would spank customers and was probably a gimmick. Well, what do you know, at that very moment, we hear pack, pack, pack and people cheering. A guy was getting spanked! And the nurse wasn't spanking him gently either!  Our friend seriously panicked and started grabbing everyone's basket and trying to hide his unfinished meal. It was hilarious. He was begging us not to tell our waitress. I really wanted to see him get spanked. Guess you had to be there cuz it was very funny seeing him sweating. When the check came, he threw some money on the table and bolted out the door....wuss.  The ambience is retro themed, like a novelty fast food burger joint, with hospital decorations. There are a lot of seatings with music playing in the back ground. There's also a scale inside and a few big guys got on it and what do you know, they weigh more than 350 lbs. one guy who I think was their friend was 3 lbs shy. The patrons cheered and were engaging. Maybe because we went late at night, when everyone is feeling good the place seemed alive.   For me Heart Attack Grill is a one time deal, just to say, I've been there, done that. Don't expect the most amazing burgers. Go there for the novelty.   Service was spot on and super friendly, the reason for the 4 star rating.   I think the hospital gowns they give you are freshly laundered because when we left we put it in a laundry basket.   As many Yelpers have stated, they take cash only. So keep this on mind. It's also kid friendly."}

I did this solely should my friend cannot Yelp this place if he did not survive his meal.*  With that said, I've heard crazy things about the Heart Attack Grill...and nothing on the positive side.  Though it's really up to the individual to come dine here, this place was pretty gimmicky and markets itself on unhealthy eating and radical indulgence.  I considered myself a very healthy eater so when my friend wanted to try out this place, I went along as moral support (and potentially an ambulance caller).  So here we go: my friend weighed himself on the outside scale and coaxed me in.  We were greeted by this poor and very unhappy hostess that gave us a quick lowdown on how this place operates.  I went along with the campy hospital gown get-up and laughable wrist band.  The place was very empty that night with only two or three other tables that were occupied.  We were seated to the far right of the restaurant and were given menus.  Prior to coming here I decided that I won't be eating anything here but to keep my friend company on his artery-clogging journey.  After a short while this super skinny rather ditzy blonde waitress with the classic Minnie Mouse squeak came over to take the order of a single bypass burger with flatliner fries.    If I were to point out anything positive here, it would be the rather entertaining music videos that were playing on the big screen.  The videos were from the 80's and kindly reminded me of my youth and stupidity.  On other screens, it showed news stories regarding the Heart Attack Grill and even how two people apparently ate themselves sick.  The place seemed proud of this achievement.  While waiting for the food to arrive, I noticed that other patrons were still waiting for theirs.  It was apparent that since it was a slow night, the cook might have decided to gather enough orders to make all the burgers all at once.  People at the other tables did seem restless.  Finally the food arrive and what I saw was a hamburger with oversized buns and a side of very dark dirty looking fries.  I cringed when my friend took his first bite and asked for his opinion.  He replied he had better...which spoke volumes.  The fries themselves looked like they were fried in old reheated lard; very dark and flimsy.  While he ate, I just sat there in my hospital gown hoping nobody I know sees me.  From the 3rd person point of view, the service here was pretty sucky.  Servers were seen gathering at one spot just conversing and joking around with each other.  Our waitress didn't really come over to check on us but just to leave off the bill.  Obviously the customers were not much of their concern.  Just think: I gave up seeing a nudie show for this.  At least my friend survived...and never got spanked."}

We went last month for the first time and he ordered a single burger with fries and a beer. I ordered fries and a butterfat shake. We both loved our food. And honestly, because I am a huge milkshake fan, I love to try new ones and this was by far the best shake I've had in a very long time. (chocolate) So thick and creamy and delicious! (must be all the fat haha) Fries were great but I did have to add a little more salt which was not a problem, my boyfriend said his burger was awesome and cooked just right. When going to this restaurant, you know you are in for a fatty, greasy, salty time and that's what you should expect.  The nurse outfits were cute, the aprons they put on you were so fun, the whole experience of this place was like no other. We DEFINITELY recommend trying heart attack grill! It was really fun, tasty, and our waitress was awesome too. :)"}

Our nurse sat us down and I felt like I was in the looney bin.  Some folks were getting shots in syringes, wine in bags, and paddles to their caboose. All very strange and quite entertaining.   We ordered a single bypass burger, which we split because they don't split the bigger burgers. If you don't finish your burger, that's a paddling. Burger toppings are limited, possibly to deter people from getting all fancy. When the burger and fries arrived they just looked sloppy. And I'm all for a sloppy burger, but it looked disgusting. Definitely not the best burger I've had. It was actually pretty bland considering it had chili on it. I realized that I was basically paying for the ambience. I washed it down with a Mexican Coke and took some candy cigarettes to go.  Now that I've done it I won't be back here."}

The decor was really nice I enjoyed looking at the remake of posters toward their advertisement. Also the set up In the middle of the resturant where the person will be spanked so everyone can see.  The nurse server we had was really nice. Even in her busy moments she took the time to talk and chat with us about eveything they had and go in a bit to her personal life.   The food on the other had was eh. I'm not much of a person the have their food cooked in lard I guess. I had the triple bypass which was their first burger to hit world record presumably. I finished it there alright I wasn't gonna get spanked. While mainly everyone went single and still struggled. But main taste was grease which I wished atleast have some flavor of something else.   But overall worth a try just don't get to hyped about it."}

If you are going to have a good time you should really try to get into the spirit of the place. It is cash only, but they do have an ATM on site. We didn't need it, but from what they told us it was only 75 cents. So there is that.   When you walk in they lay out the rules... In that you have to pay cash, wear a hospital gown, and finish your food.   The menu is all bad for you, but it was all very delicious. The burger patties are 1/2 pound use that as your gauge of how much you can eat. If you don't finish your burger the sweet nurses will paddle you for it. So be good and eat up!!! Jello shot syringes are a must, also why not get a pill bottle of alcohol. It is a fun souvenir to have. The burgers all come with chili, without the beans, and they are delicious.   It was definitely a good experience all around. I recommend at least one trip to this place!!!   Tip: If you weigh 350 lbs + you eat for free."}

I tried the hot dog, problem is the chili was so so, and no heat to it. The dog itself was decent but the bun coulda woulda shoulda be smaller or toasted or something. The girls were kinda lackluster but maybe it was because we went on a Sunday. There just wasn't a lot of personality in the room and isn't that what makes a tourist restaurant a place locals want to go too?

The single has 5 pieces of bacon, double has 10 pieces, triple 15, and quad 20!! Beef is 1/2 pound to 2 lbs with all the fixings: cheese, onion & tomatoe. French fries that are fresh cut & deep fried in pure Lard, mmmmmmm!! Either a chocolate or Vanilla milkshake made with ButterFat. A bottled water or CocaCola in a bottle. No other sodas and they dont have ice.  CASH ONLY! They also sell Lucky Strike Cigarettes in a vending machine by the carton.  The food was nothing spectacular, Ive definitely had better. But the experience was fun & different. A nurse went to a table and spanked a customer with a paddle for being a bad boy & not finishing his food.

If you are expecting more, you will be disappointed. Everything is calorie-filled and tasty, and you won't leave hungry. The shakes have a pad of butter on top and are around 2000 calories.  They only take cash but have an ATM in the restaurant with a small 75 cent service fee.  If you don't get a heart attack from eating their food, you will definitely get one from looking at the waitresses.

As soon as our Host walked up to the Heart Attack Grill Host say she cant seat 40 people.  Our host told the host at the restaurant she can seat how many she can at once that we don't have to all sit together. The girl then said she will not be able to serve us.  So my boss the owner of the company walked in ^ tried to get seats & he was starting to get upset because the host was ignoring him.  So he asked if she spoke english since she was ignoring him.  That was wrong of him but he was frustrated at this point.  The host of Heart Attack Grill proceeded to say that she does & that we are disrespectful & refuses to seat us & has every right to,  So we told her fine that she just lost alot a money & we walked out.  I thought about it & went back in to ask for the manager contact info & the girls name that refused us service.  The security stepped in between & told her not to respond.  She told me she has the right to refuse service to who she wants & I told her Yes, you do have the right to refuse service to us or anyone else, but I also have the right to file complaint with your  management Needless to say she refused to give up any info about the manager or owner info or her name. As a person that runs a company customer service is #1 & the host provided bad customer service from the start.  And turning away 40 people for no reason other than they cant seat them together is a joke. Especially when we told her she can seat everyone separate, & that we don't have to be seated all at once. It was going to be my first time at Heart Attack Grill, but I will never step foot in that business just from this one experience.  I could just imagine how the service would have been if we would have got inside.

A porn hospital maybe. Whatever. I think I gave out the don't even freaking touch us vibe, because she didn't.   I ordered a chocolate butterfat shake, not knowing what they meant by butterfat. It came with a pat of butter in it, like some kind of garnish. Butter is not a garnish for ice cream. Blech!  Oh and.... It's cash only. Seriously?

The hamburger was decent, nothing special.  For the price, you can definitely find a better burger in this town.  The fries, however, were kinda gross.  In my opinion, fries fried in duck fat is simply unnatural and tasted funny.  I mean, I grew up eating certain foods fried in lard, particularly at my grandmother's house, so it's not exactly an unfamiliar taste.   Who knows, maybe I've grown conditioned to fries fried in certain types of oil.  The fries were also soggy.  I can't quite put my finger on the taste, but suffice it to say, I won't be ordering fries there again.  Would I go again? Meeh...probably not...maybe, just maybe, with OOT family or friends.

Come on, what is the reason for not taking credit cards when the whole world accepts it?  That you might die and credit card might not get cleared?   Second, the menu.  Just a handful of items?  I was expecting something more than just a burger / fries and hot dog.   Third, the food itself.  If you make your burger in lard and is supposed to have 1000s of calories, it should be tasty, rt?  Or so I thought.  I finished it only because I just wanted to avoid a scene of arguing with them that I don't want spanking even if I did not finish food (though most of the people over there seemed to enjoy it - maybe I am the minority, but it was not fun for me).  I think it is the chilli that spoiled the taste of the burger.  But whatever it is, the taste was nothing to write about. Fourth, the ambiance.  I will rate the indoor atmosphere only at the same level of McDonalds or Burger King.   Fifth, the security - locked doors only to be opened by security after verifying you paid.  Why?  I mean, they seriously make you feel like you are in a mental assylum with the nurses costumes and the spanking machine in the middle.  No problem for me with a restaurant having security, but I have never seen any one watching at the door so closely as if people eating there might run away in the middle without paying. I definitely think they have a unique theme that can attract people.  But make a great tasty food worth the calories and improve the ambiance - it can be a game changer.  Also, please be a bit more family friendly or advise that this is not a family friendly place.  As a family man / Christian, this place has been my first big turnoff place in US.  I have been to a variety of restuarants before.  But this is the first one that I found to be odd - in an unpleasant way."}

We witnessed several patrons receiving harsh paddling due to their failure to finish their meals. It was great, and we made sure to take several pictures of the paddlings as well as the rest of the experience.

At this point I was so turned off by her service I didn't want to pay her a penny for a glass of water. And being 16 weeks pregnant there weren't any drink options for me. My friend said the burger was average, and none of us liked how we were treated. Definitely won't be returning."}

The burger was pretty good nothing amazing but good.  We killed our food the coke from the glass bottle was perfect.  I couldn't even eat a shake I was too full.  A single is ample food you have got to be crazy to go bigger or extremely hungry.  They greet you in the front and put on a robe which is cool cuz it can get messy.  The waitresses were all nice although I heard this place has toned down a lot from its days in Arizona.  Nurse Stephanie was awesome we exchanged a ton of jokes and laughs.  We even did the jello shots.  We had a great time sitting at the bar and observing.  I would go back!!"}

First let me say this place is no where near the strip and you have to take a taxi to get to it if you're staying in a hotel on the strip.  And you can honestly get a much better tasting burger at a nicer restaurant on the strip for the exact same price.  It's a big place that looks like someone took a high school cafeteria and tried to dress it up.  The concept is cool but it could be done up a lot better.  Lots of little improvements here and there could change the whole experience.  The food tasted okay and I swear I've had better at a Wendy's drive through.  The fries I couldn't even finish and I was hoping it would be something that would pop in my mouth and scream AMAZING, but it was more of a yawn.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Burger crew meeting called to order on Friday, May 20, 2016 at 9:35pm (Burger Crew does Vegas/Burger Crew Founders' Birthday Bash).   Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.  I. Ordering Between the 5 of us, we ordered 3 Single Bypass Burgers (comes with tomato, red onion, cheese, and chili) - $9.25. We opted to add 5 slices of bacon for 92 cents. We were not asked how we wanted to burgers cooked. We each got a coke - $2.08. We also had an order of flatliner fries (cooked in lard) for $1.85.   II. The burgers The best term used to describe these burgers was a salt bomb. The doctor who brought our order said these burgers were over 3,000 calories each! The burgers were very sizable. They were cooked well done, but surprisingly didn't have a good sear. The bacon was the star of the show. It was crispy and flavorful. It added a great texture and flavor to the burger. The chili was also a great addition to the burger. It helped to mask the lack of meat flavor in the meat patty itself. The red onion was overpowering. They give an entire slice of onion without breaking it up. We were definitely oozing onion breath all over the place for the next couple hours.  III. The fries The fries were cooked in lard, and it makes a difference. Trevor mentioned that he can taste the meatiness in the fries. They were nice and thin, crispy, and salty AF (according to DK).  IV. Miscellaneous This place is definitely playing up the fact that this stuff is loaded with calories, fat, and salt. It's pretty much the epitome of America. Before going in, you are gowned in a hospital gown. The waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses. Our nurse Jaimee was great. They have a policy that people are not allowed to split food (except for the single bypass burger and their hot dog). You cannot split anything larger than that. They also do not serve tap water (a bottle of water will cost of $2.08). They are cash only so be sure to bring enough (though they have an ATM inside the restaurant just in case). They also have a policy that if you do not finish your food, the nurse will spank you. They have a little area in the middle of the restaurant they take you and have you bend over and they spank you with a paddle. These nurses are serious! They were serving up some pretty horrifically strong sounding spanks. It was pretty entertaining to watch these guys try to keep a straight face while getting spanked by a sexy nurse. It was even more entertaining to see these grown men beg her to stop! The whole vibe of the restaurant is really fun. It was a great way to kick off our gluttonous weekend of burgerdom.   V. Value The bacon is a great value! You get 5 whole slices for less than a dollar! Most other places charge at least $2 for bacon and you get 2 slices. The value for the burgers increases with the number of patties you add. At $9.25 for a single bypass, it was an alright value since the burger was pretty big, but if you go up to the octuple bypass (yes, that's 8 patties) the value is incredible at only $23.   VI. The verdict This place was fun and the burgers were not as bad as we were expecting them to be. Here are the ratings: 1.9, 2.0, 2.5, 2.8, and 3.0. Fun to go for the atmosphere, but there are definitely better burgers out there.  Next burger crew meeting: Carson Kitchen right after we finish at Heart Attack! Vegas, baby! Wooooooo!"}

Basically, fat people are welcome here. If you are over 350 pounds, you eat for free. Their menu is very simple. Burgers, fries, and milkshakes. It is a hospital themed restaurant and the servers are all scantily clad nurses. If it's your birthday or you don't finish your meal, you get a spanking in front of the whole restaurant. That encouraged me to eat my single bypass.   For about $52, we fed 5 people. That order consisted of 4 single bypass burgers with bacon, 2 large fries, 3 cokes, and 2 waters.   The burger was NOT bad at all. The fries were gross. Disgusting. I hate thick, wet, soggy fries. The fries tasted like bacon. Meh!  My bf broke a sweat eating the single bypass with fries. I laughed at him. I didn't break a sweat but it took me double the time to finish. i would come here again but not order the fries. The nurses were very friendly."}

I have indeed returned to Heart Attack Grill with visitors from out of town as I said I may in my first review.  The burger was good again. I passed on the fries this time.  What gives this place a boost this time around is the event I witnessed on my second visit.  This is not in reference to the patient who had an actual heart attack while dining.  To give that an extra star would be cruel and sick on my part.  No, my extra star comes on the wings of a public spanking of two patients by a rather sultry nurse.  These two finished, on their own, a burger larger than a single bypass burger.  One finished a double.  The other, a triple.  In response they were required to remove their wallet from the back pocket, bend over a chair and receive three spanks asking Please nurse, may I have another in between each.  This caught the attention of not only the other diners but the people walking outside as well.  It was quite funny. Not to mention entertaining.  I hate to sound deranged by saying that public humiliation is something to be admired but this is Las Vegas.  Heart Attack Grill is bringing the sin back to Sin City."}

The milkshakes are made with butter fat and are absolutely amazing. Best vanilla Milkshake I've ever had.  The servers are all young, attractive women dressed up as sexy nurses. The service left something to be desired though because the main promotion is anyone over 350 lbs eats free. I was weighed by the hostess when I arrived and let's just say, I qualify. After we ate, the nurse brought us the bill and my meal was not comped. I asked about the promotion and she said that I don't eat free because she didn't see me weigh in. After a long debate with the manager, it was determined that I could weigh in again and get my meal comped.

My husband and i went here with my sister and our daughters last weekend, and we enjoyed the entertainment, but the food was not as top notch as i thought it would be. The waitresses were very nice, and attended to all our needs. I would recomend coming here at least once, but not to make it a regular thing. I would have to say Five Guys or even In and Out burger are better burgers than here. Other than that everyhting was pretty good! :)"}

I came to Vegas on my annual trip here and saw they opened one a few years ago and i was pretty stoked cause now i could try them. So my wife, son and I rolled into town last night and my cousins who live in Vegas wanted to try them for the first time and i said Sure.  So we come here and got the gown, sat down and i was scared the food was gonna taste like greasy crap and you know what? It was pretty damn good. The girls were beautiful and the waitress we had was the blonde midget....excuse me, little person, and she was so awesome. Aside from being sexy as hell...she was soooo friendly.   The only thing that really sucks about this place is:  - cash only - they have no kids menu. People do come to Vegas with kids, you know? - the burgers are ala carte...so you gotta order fries with them. - you cant ask for a glass of water because you have to buy bottles of water and cant bring water in. That really sucks. - i really wish the sodas came in refillable glasses. They come in bottles. I really hate when restaurants do that.  But all in all....it was a fun experience and may not be up everyones alley. But i may return next Vegas trip.  Give them a try."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "The Heart Attack Grill is a lot of fun. The first thing they do is have a really hot waiter or waitress dress you in  a hospital gown while being admitted to the restaurant. A very sexy and overly friendly nurse/waitress with a mini-skirt and low-cut blouse will come to your table to help you order. She will sit down and talk with you while you order.  They have a vegan menu, it has one item on it, cigarettes. Ordering carefully is very important here, because if you do not finish your burger the nurse/waitress spanks you with a wooden paddle in front of all the dinners in the restaurant. I do not think they spank very hard because the guys were lining up for spanking as others took photos of them being spanked. Even though I finished my single burger and she offered to spank me just for the hell of it. I politely declined. If you claim to weigh over 350 pounds, they will put you on a scale to weigh you. If you reach the magic number, you eat for free. One guy was over 350 pounds, so the whole room cheered for him. When the drinks are delivered, they are bought out in an IV Bag (intravenous bag) on an IV  stand. The decorations are hilarious. Overall it is a really fun place. The food was kind of pricey, the burgers start at $10 for a single and it was not that great. The burger was cold and just not special, it might have just been a bad night. Despite crappy food, I still gave this place five stars,  because it was a blast!"}

I requested extra cheese on my items because I love cheese and was very surprisingly answered with a we don't do extra cheese here response from our waiter. No extra cheese?!? You cook your food items in lard and yet no extra cheese allowed??? Something was fishy about that. Apparently we just so happened to be served by a cheese nazi because the person who actually brought out our food was more than happy to give us extra cheese. Chili cheese fries were decent, however I probably won't be back."}

There were 2 young ladies at the door, both dressed in those sexy nurse type outfits as were the waitresses there.  One of them took my order for the smallest burger they had, which by the time you add tax & tip it was over $10.  I don't remember seeing any other female customers, just a few tables of men dressed in hospital gowns.  There was no comfortable place to wait in front so I wandered around the place.  For a long time.  It was a long wait.  It was not a good burger.  None of it was.  Really false advertising for a place that hypes decadently delicious food.  Just now I checked their menu online (http://www.heartattackgrill.com/heart-attack-grill-menu.html) because I was trying to remember what I had paid.  Their website shows animated, scantily clad women doing things like humping a hotdog.  Another shows a woman who has been hogtied with bacon lying on her stomach and moving her boobs around as she tries to free herself.    The young ladies I met at the door seemed very nice and the service was good other then the long wait.  But the food is not good and let's face it - their target market is men (especially misogynistic men) who want to over eat and then j*rk off.    I'm just not in that demographic."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Two university friends and myself took upon ourselves to take a pit stop in Vegas to check out the American-core extravaganza of money and breasts. Well decided to get our debauched night started, we decided it would be fueled by the servings of the appropriate Heart Attack Grill.  We entered the shameless yet upfront calorie dispenser, passing a laughing overweight family trying out a cattle weight scale by the entrance. They dress you up as a hospital patient and a nurse (your server) sits you down in a loud cantina-like room where a dozen screens show news stories of clients suffering from health problems in relation to the restaurant itself. People are constantly eagerly peaking inside as if the restaurant was a monkey cage at a zoo. The mascot of the restaurant is doctor Mendele's reincarnation whose evil goals consist of giving you heart diseases.  We were given an overpriced menu with few items, including a vegan section which contained 100% organic cigarettes. A large statue of a nurse riding a cigarette is another celebration of tobacco in the establishment, and I, being a smoker, found both distasteful. Which brings me to the next point: the food.  We ordered a regular sized burger each by our large-breasted nurse with a hint of sadness in her eye, who then told us about the consequences of not finishing our meal: a public spanking in the middle of the restaurant. This happened 5 times while we ate with the whole restaurant cheering for the food waste. A morbidly obese man also got cheered for when he stepped on a scale and activated an alarm for being excessively heavy. He did not look cheerful however, although one gets to eat for free if above 350lbs.  We observed these scenes while waiting for our food, feeling increasingly uncomfortable from the desecration of weight problems, excessive machismo, and praising of tobacco and saturated fats, leading cause of the two literal biggest fatal diseases in the US, heart disease and cancer. I was already feeling sick when i got my food. This experience managed to convince me that fat is not correlated with tastefulness, as the large bun, patty, chili, and bacon all were as bland as the fries (separately bought). Interestingly, the most tasty ingredient was the tomato and onion in the burger. For the whole time i ate this entire meal I enjoyed myself at no single point.  Im not even proud I have visited this place. I'm embarrassed of myself and everyone who ate there that day.  I wish I could un-eat this meal. What we thought would be a unique counter cultural attraction revealed itself to be a sad reminder of contemporary problems in US society and people's attitudes toward them. This place advertises itself to be horrible and it is. They got that right."}

A word of warning, I ordered the triple-bypass, with bacon, before I knew how hard those waitresses spank you with the paddle! I was plenty motivated after seeing that, and finished all 1 //2+ pounds, and 6000 calories, without too much difficulty. Putting mustard on it at the end help cut through all that richness that I knew was making my gall bladder cry like a baby. The burger itself was quite good, and reasonably priced. I wish I could say I tried some of the other items on the menu, but the rest of my party enjoyed what they has as well (chili fries and drinks for the most part). Shots of alcohol come in prescription bottles with your name and 'directions for use' - a nice touch, and our 'nurse' was fantastic. Great service all-around.   Don't forget, cash only. The more people in your group, the more fun you'll have. People that are reserved, by nature, need not apply- the place is a bit of freak show.

If you weigh over 350 pounds you eat for free, and you can weigh yourself on a scale right outside the restaurant. When I heard They spank you if you don't finish I thought they mean playfully. No. I was so wrong. They wind up with a paddle and smack you, hard! They left one poor girl with the back end redder than fire. It was entertaining to watch, but will strike fear into you to finish whatever you order. You can ask to get spanked if you so wish.    I give the restaurant a 5 for it's theming. It's medical themed. They have you dress in gowns, bring out wine in IV bags and have shots in a plastic syringe. Employees are dressed in scrubs and nurses uniforms. It was a fun experience. Although the food was only okay.   I give the food a 3. They have a limited number of drinks to choose from, and the menu is pretty small as well so choices are limited. I got the Coronary dog, half pound hot dog with Chili. I felt like the chili was bland and the hot dog just tasted off. My husband tried the hot dog as well and felt the same. I was disappointed in how it tasted. Everyone else in our party seemed to like their burgers. The onion rings were good, but not anything special.

I like it. I was able to finish my burger, but not my fries. My boyfriend was able to finish his too. Oh, since he got a free burger he can get another one but he didnt want another one.   Our nurse she was sweet and explain everything about the heart attack grill. Oh, and the guy who got spanked before he gotten spanked again but the thing was he did finish his double bypass burger but left a small piece on purpose because he wanted to get spanked again.

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Yes I am actually giving another burger joint 5 Stars. This is only the second time I've ever given a burger joint 5 Stars. The first was a Red Robin in the Fair Lakes area of Fairfax County Virginia, not Red Robin in general. Been to many Red Robin's but the Fair Lakes restaurant deserve 5 stars not so much the other Red Robin's. In fact the Fairfax one is the only one I'll go to. The Heart Attack Grill is located on Fremont Street in the Fremont Street Experience area of Las Vegas.   Now about the 5 Stars. The reason I gave the 5 stars to the Fairfax Red Robin is for a completely different reason I'm giving the 5 stars to the Heart Attack Grill. As Ricky Ricardo would say I have some splaining to do.   Here goes. The Red Robin was because of the quality of the food, the atmosphere of the restaurant and the exceptional customer service. Now the quality of the food from the Heart Attack Grill isn't as good as the Red Robin. Don't get me wrong the burger was a good one. The ambience of the restaurant isn't quite the same but I will tell you the Heart Attack Grill was really a lot of fun, the most fun I've ever had in a burger joint. The atmosphere here is fun and hilarious. Plus, I got spanked by a cute waitress in a sexy nurse outfit, how about them apples. Of course just the fact that it's located in the Fremont Street Experience give it a little nudge up. If you put all these pieces together you get 5 stars for sure.  Also, let me ad, the customer service is very good. The whole premise is that the food is bad for you. Let's be honest, the Heart Attack Grill is honest. McDonalds and Burger King and all those other fast food joints know their food is not healthy. But in their defense, they never expected people to eat in their restaurants so often. I know people that eat fast food 5 or 6 days a week and they wonder why they are in poor health, DUH. In moderation McDonalds and Burger King are fine.   At the Heart Attack Grill if your over 350 pounds you can eat for free. It's all about being unhealthy and it's just fun an hilarious. They make you wear a hospital gown and all the waiters and waitresses are like nurses and doctors.   Even in Yelp, when you check into the Heart Attack Grill you get three free spankings from a nurse. My wife got spanked from a male nurse and I a female nurse. How great is that? a burger and a spanking? Does it get any better than that? No my friends it doesn't. I even got a nurse beer. (See pictures) and my wife got a shot of rum and the shots come in a prescription medicine bottle lol. With warning on it.   The food came out pretty quickly and the burger was pretty darn good, the fries were good too. The customer service is way above average. Everyone there was super friendly and nice. They all looked like they were having a good time. I would guess working there would be fun, the restaurant is all about having a good time. The prices are very reasonable as well.   There also have t-shirts and other souvenirs. One more thing in the urinals in the bathroom you can pee on either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, it's worth the visit just to do that. I'm not going to tell you who I did it to.  So yes, you put all these things together you get 5 stars. You have to make this a stop while visiting Las Vegas. Next year we are bring my daughter and her husband when me make our next trip to Las Vegas and you can bet we'll be bringing them to the Heart Attack Grill."}

I walked in to order some shakes to go from the front counter (no one in my party wanted to have to put on a hospital gown to sit down and eat there). The girls working there were super friendly and were happy to let me place a to-go order. But the shakes were just gross. They left a weird, waxy (or maybe buttery?) coating in your mouth and the ice cream was not spectacular.   I get that this place is a gimmick more than a an actual restaurant, but I would recommend saving your time and money for something else. Speaking from just having the nasty shakes, we did not order any burgers."}

The bun was really good. It was light and crispy but warm and doughy on the inside. You get a hospital gown when you come in which comes in handy . You will not leave this place clean. If you don't finish your meal then you get a sparking by one of the waitresses dressed in a nurses outfit. Not just a little paddling either!! I'm talking a down right hard spanking!

She put hospital gowns on us along with the hospital bracelets, which stated something about a bypass The menu is simple and the burgers come in four different sizes: A single, double, triple, and quadruple with each patty being 1/2 a lb !  We got a single bypass  1/2 lb hamburger (they do not allow you to share any of the bigger burgers) and this was definitely the tastiest thing on. The burger comes with a thick slice of cheese, tomatoes,  grilled onions, and about 5 strips of bacon.     I thoroughly enjoyed the friendly  waitresses are dressed like nurses, down to the good food and the spanking with the PADDLE  if you didn't finish all of your food from your sexy nurse, This is clearly a theme restaurant and the food was great, not excellent. Only because I am not used to fries cooked in LARD. The food is full of fat, but you know that going it.

Their very limited menu consists of half-pound burger patties (you can order up to eight on a bun), fries cooked in lard and bottled sodas. The food is memorable, but not in a good way. I don't know if it was the method of cooking but this was the worst burger I've ever consumed in my four decades of my life. The texture was mealy and the taste reminded me of a spoiled turkey burger. Not to mention pricy. The fries were inexpensive but weren't much better.  It should be pointed out that if you weigh over 350 pounds you eat for free. Also, people who do not finish their meal get an optional paddling in full view of patrons.

I had a single bypass and a side a fries. The burger just did not have that much taste, maybe I was just missing my tomato and lettuce, but the burger was not juicey and the bun was dry. The fries tasted like they were cooked in really old oil but were better than the burger. Go once for the experiance but just have a shake and skip the burger and fries."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This place is truly a gimmick. It might even have been created on a dare.  But, a gimmick that makes a darn tasty burger.  The menu warns you, up front, what you are walking into.  Specifically, it warns you about the specific kind of surgery that you are likely going to require if you continue eating these burgers.  The fries are fried in lard and the milk shakes have the highest milkfat percentage of any shake traditionally produced.  In fact, they tried to run it a couple percentage points higher, I am told, but the shake machine kept seizing up.  So, just to flaunt reality, they will drop pats of butter into some of your shakes.  This is truly a place where you go to say to the wind with all dietary restrictions. And vegetables. And sobriety. And sanity.  Seating is more than ample here and you don't leave hungry.  Prices are reasonable and the mural on the back wall, alone, is worth the price of any menu item."}

Beers are 24 oz and cold. Food arrives quickly and service is attentive. Many video screens with mostly 90's music videos to watch while waiting. Burgers are quite good, no complaint except possibly too much cheese. Fries are nice but expected a bit more flavor from the lard. Milkshake is very tasty yet pure fat.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Heart Attack Grill...  Its was my birthday last night, I.m in Vegas and saw this place and thought I would try it out.  Well, I couldn't get a heart attack from this place, what I got was a rude John Basso, dressed up in a doctors outfit, wear a cheap stethascope around his neck.  Mr. John Basso has failed 2 other times in the Heart Attack Grill business  in Chandler AZ and Dallas TX.   He obviously doesn't pay his rent in one article, and only takes cash, no 20 cents charge for a slide of the card, that only people carry on the Fremont experience, very unsafe place of homeless and mental cases running around.   So here is what happened, I am a Registered Nurse, my girl friend is a Event Planner, we work with people all day,  We travel and deal with food servers and customer service all day every day.  So I ordered the triple bypass, the buttery shake, and the waitrass said are you going to share it?  I said we always share the food, we cut down on portions and tonight we were trying to decrease our calories my girlfriend wanted a bite.   Guess what?   You can't give your girlfriend a bite!!! So the waitress said order something else and I will bring you another little paper boat so you can share. So the place was dirty, floor needed mopping and table was sticky, no towel was seen in a nurses hand, so no skills of sterile fields there.  Burger came, and my girlfriend ordered chili fries recommended by the nurse/waitress. I cut a 2 bite size off my triple bypass burger and she proceeded to eat it.  The waitress came by and said he doesn't like you sharing.  You will have to pack up the food and leave.  So my girlfriend quite politely said  Let me talk to the manager.  So we keep eating and here comes Mr. John Basso, he said you have to pay your bill and leave.  I said really you think you can enforce no sharing of food?    He tried to touch our food, and shove it in a bag and threw a receipt on the table, I said were not paying for this, he said you ate some of it, and the girlfriend said just take off the chili fries that sucked anyway.  He said NO!!!  He threatened to call Metro Police.. We said do it.  So he walked away and we took off the gowns and sat there. John Basso came back and said So your gonna pay for your food.  Which is $23 bucks.  I said no Im waiting for the metro police.   So he got a security guard to show up.  I said where is the police?  Obviously he is in the wrong and he said Give me fucking 20 bucks and get the fuck out of my grill.  I gave him $20.00 then he didn't want me to take my food.  And he said Fuck You!!!.. Well I said Fuck you back!!!  Then I bagged up my food and started walking.    I told him he will be reported to social media like this one.. He said  Go ahead it is just more publicity for me!!!   We walked outside and the security guard was going, wow he called me cause you gave your girlfriend a piece of your hamburger?  I said yes..  He said he has had to come here before for reasons that  were just as weird. So he was on our side.  While walking out we told a few not to eat here.  I think Mr. John Bass is going to have a heart attack, he is rude and has no respect for people in the public, and hates his business.  I think the cash thing is a cover up for all the money he hides from the government. I will contact anyone that will listen about his business, and see if the IRS will find some way to tack him with his bank accounts. Stress is the silent killer increasing heart rates and can cause a stroke at the work place. I would never eat there, and I gave my left overs to a homeless man and woman outside.  This business won't last with his attitude. Oh and he said to me I've been in business for 10 years.  Look it up on Wickapedia:  2010 started in Chandler AZ then failed and then Dallas TX then failed.   So he is a liar too.  John Basso shame on you."}

Then they seat you and explain the rules.  If you weigh more than 350 pounds and will get on the scale that is inside the restaurant so everyone can see your burger is free.  You must eat everything you order or you get spanked. By a waitress in a nurse's uniform with a paddle. Seriously.   The menu is very limited which is probably good since if you order too much... off to get spanked. I ordered a beer (giant can). My boyfriend ordered a daiquiri (the bring it as a virgin daiquiri with the rum in a large pill bottle on the side so you can add it yourself). Drinks were good. The burgers are LARGE. I ordered just a single cheeseburger. My boyfriend got a single burger with everything and a side or fries. The burgers were very good!!!   It took a bit but we finished all our food. Another group didn't. A guy got his three spankings (and they went to town on him but he said he wanted it hard so that's what he got).

We figured it was a gimmicky place and would be ok at best.    Got placed into our hospital gowns and seated.  It was busy so wait was a little long but our nurse got us our drinks pretty quick.   We decided on food and ordered.  I opted for the 1/2 lb hot dog with chili and bacon.  It came out and looked amazing.  I managed to finish it because I didn't want my ass paddled  ( optional fun if you don't finish....having a hot nurse paddle ya).     So how was the food you ask?  It was damn good.  Chili was delish and the hot dog was beefy and flavorful.   We all thought...wow this place is legit.  The onion rings are damn good too.  Of you are on Fremont St in Vegas give this place a shot. Haha....I said shot."}

I didn't like that it was mandatory to wear a hospital gown, and maybe I felt that way because I already had a Santa suit on from the Las Vegas Santa Run I just finished, but it made me feel stuffy.    The menu was more like a comic book and I was searching all over for the food, and the water.   They only serve bottled water! I am picky about my bottled water and it needs to be reverse osmosis. I just want my regular tap water with lemon.  Not paying for a bottle of water that I'm not going to enjoy.     And the utensils . I LOVE plastic forks. I use them at home. But when the fork is so cheap it bends when you eat your food, it pisses me off. Invest in a better fork with the profits your making off the bottled water . And then leaving, I don't even know what it's called but it's the rotating bar that spins down when you walk thru it and push it down. If your 350 pounds you can't even leave. And then to top it off, they try to up sell you on Souvenir's. It wasn't a fun or pleasant experience, and the seating is to close together , again if your catering to, or want larger people to come in, open up the space, I'm average size and felt trapped.  I won't be back."}

The only downfall(the most important one) is that the food sucks, the only thing that doesn't suck is the mexican coke with real cane sugar !!! But heart attack grill doesn't even make the coke, so they pretty much just suck.   If the burger actually tasted good, it would be unhealthy if you ate all of it.  But since the burger has no taste, and is just a piece of cooked meat on a huge bun, with a few measly pieces of tomato, there is nothing that would really make you want to go back.   I had the 1/2 lb. burger, and ate the entire burger but didn't eat 1/2 of the bun.  I only ate the burger because I paid for it, and I was hungry, or else I probably wouldn't have even eaten it.   The fries are soggy and gross.  I don't usually add salt on my food, but I had to put salt on these fries to eat them, and they were still pretty gross.   I was going to order a milkshake, but the milkshake was in such a small cup that there was no justifying the $5 price tag.   The only novelty in this restaurant is the scale outside the door, and the slutty nurse costumes that the waitresses must wear.   The waitresses are friendly, and the owner is the doctor looking man with the stethoscope around his neck.   We came in on Friday around 6pm, and there were only 30 or so patrons in a room meant for at least 75.... they should probably improve their food, and add more items to the ( 5 item menu) or I don't see why anyone would bother coming back."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "I visited the Heart Attack Grill in Phoenix a few times, and was really excited when Dr. Jon brought the concept here.  I love this place.  I've read through all of the reviews here, and the responses seem to indicate people who don't get it.  This place UNABASHEDLY is what it is.  If you don't like it, go somewhere else.     *****  There are a few of the common points in these reviews I'd like to respond to -   #1 - Price - I think this place is very reasonable for what you are getting.  The single burger is a half pound, comes with fries, and runs about $7.50.  It's about $2 more than a large McDonald's value meal, and that $2 is paying for the atmosphere and a better overall quality of food.    #2 - Burgers - Are you going to get a Gourmet burger?  No.  But you'll get a REALLY good fast food burger.  If you are expecting a 5 star burger here, you are at the wrong place.  The Heart Attack is essentially a really fun, upscale FAST FOOD joint.  Think In-n-out rather than Gourmet Burger.  Do you get to choose how well done the burger is, or what kind of cheese it has?  Nope.  But you can't do that at McDonald's or Wendy's either.  If you are looking for fancy, this place isn't for you.  #3 - The Fries - I like the taste of lard cooked fries. (Have since I was a kid)  They do tend to be a little soft and chewy as opposed to crisp, and they have a very different flavor than fries cooked in vegetable oil.  Again, this place is what it is.  If you are expecting McDonald's style super crispy fries, you're out of luck, but give this a try, and you may find you enjoy them.  (I do miss the unlimited fry bar.  They had it in Phoenix, and opted not to bring it to Vegas)  #4 - Milkshakes - Don't think milkshakes.  Think old school East-Coast frozen custard.  These shakes are VERY rich, very creamy, very thick, and just enough sweet to make them wonderful without being overpowering.  They are IMHO the best thing on the menu.  I prefer the vanilla.  The chocolate ones use actual cocoa powder, so they have a semi-sweet, dark chocolate kind of taste, which I find a bit bitter, but my wife loves.  Just scoop the little pat of butter out of the way (the same way you'd remove the umbrella from your alcoholic beverage) and dig in to the creamiest ice cream you've ever had.  #5 - Service - I can't speak to the problems that others have mentioned, as I've never had a problem here.  I visited the Chandler location 3 times, and have been to the Vegas location 3 times.  In those 6 visits, I've never had a wait to get a table, and I've never had less than perfect service.  If Dr. Jon is there, he always comes out and welcomes us, and has twice sat and talked with me at length about the restaurant and marketing and business.  (much like the conversation described by Steve F. above)  He's always been very pleasant and a lot of fun.  #6 - Theme - Yes, you have to wear the gowns.  It's part of the fun.  No, they don't serve diet.  Diet soda misses the WHOLE POINT of the place.  You CAN order water, but it comes in bottles.   People...this place is a celebration of excess and fat and tasty food and obesity.  It flies in the face of healthy and says right on the front door that this food is going to kill you.  Why would you be surprised that the food is grease laden, artery clogging, fattening goodness?   Don't go to a strip club and complain about nudity.  Don't go to a bar and complain about alcohol.  Don't go to a casino and complain about gambling, and for God's sake, if you go to the HEART ATTACK, expect to get over the top fatty food in a fun, cheeky environment...and don't complain if that's what you get when you are there."}

I would not recommend this place for the quality of the food; definitely nothing special about it; as a matter of fact they advertise how bad it is for you and they are proud of it. But you don't go there for the quality but the fun, and that is ok, especially if you are entertaining some guests in town. Our first experience was actually very good, thanks to the friendly service. For some reason, they only accepted cash and their hours are not very long, considering they are on the busiest place in Vegas. Regardless, be ready for a fun visit especially if you enjoy watching people getting spanked (for not finishing their meal) or even better if you like to be on the receiving end. And those spanks are pretty heavy! They will not spare you if you can handle it... Menu choice is very limited and wacky (Burgers are offered with up to six patties!, (The sextuple bi-pass), decor is very simple, but again, you are not going there for a nice date; they actually make you wear hospital gowns and some drink are offered on an IV drip, and need I mention, the waitresses are dressed as nurses....well more like naughty nurses...."}

The novelty of the place is funny, and it is what it is. Gimmick with the hospital gown, nurses as the waitresses, and even a doctor wandering about.  Though.. there are some words of warning... they serve unhealthy food... THAT'S THE POINT... nothing is healthy here... so why would they serve diet soda? Yea.. they have water now because restaurants are always required to serve it.. but you have to buy a bottle ($2).. ok.. it sucks.. it's just a regular 16.9 oz bottle of water you can get a big case of 24 for like $5 at a grocery store.. (so $2 is a major ripoff..)  So, if you want water.. I'd say just bring in a bottle of your own (not sure if they'd let you, but shoot... I'd sneak in one for whatever.).. Just be prepared ahead of time.  ... and it's CASH ONLY. another downer and something you need to be prepared for.. The atm there charges $0.75 and at least for me.. isn't that bad... though it's best if you remember to bring in cash in the first place.  I love bacon. It's a wonderful thing... so when I found out they had tons of it in their burger.. as well as the fries being fried in lard... HELL YEAH I was excited. If people are grossed out about that... sorry.. you can go elsewhere. And the butter fat shakes.. again.. it's unhealthy.. of course it's on the menu...  so again.. if you're grossed out by it... don't order it.. DUH... and btw, i had one made with chocolate.. it was DELICIOUS... you wanna call it gross? fine.. go eat some broccoli with some non-fat ranch dressing.  BTW, I went yesterday evening and enjoyed the food enough to come back again tonight. Is it wrong to promote obesity by giving people free food if they weigh over 350 lbs? I actually find that disturbing... but hey.. the food here is good.. and I won't argue about that."}

The second time was to bring one of my co-workers that I was in Vegas with.  Yes, it's a gimmick.  Get over that.  You walk in, they put a wrist band and hospital gown onto you.  You then have four burger options....single, double, triple, or quadruple bypass.   Each patty is a half pound, so you do the math.  The only thing that comes on it is tomato, onion and cheese.  Bacon is extra, but over-loaded for a small upcharge.  Mayonnaise is served in squeeze bottles tableside.  Both times I had a superlative experience.  On my first trip, I ordered a Coors Light from the bartender.  She stared at me until I realized my mistake, then I got a PBR.  I figured what the hell, it's not like I'm going for quality here.  The PBR was covered in ice and was super cold, which went perfect with the great burger I got.  I found their burgers to be quite good, on both visits.  The fries are not my style, but are fried up in lard.  IT'S A GIMMICK, DEAL WITH IT.  I spoke freely with the super-friendly wait staff, both the owner who was in a doctor's coat and the bartender in the nurse's outfit.  This was about the time that the doctor chastised the bartender for both of us not having a cold beer in our hands.  Beers were provided to both of us then, one that was not on my tab.  After that, when I went to pay (CASH ONLY), the bartender pushed my money away, said, We're not done with you yet.   She then produced two massive glasses filled with Jaeger.  Say what you will about whether you like licorice booze or not, but you can't turn it away when it's sitting in front of you.   I downed the shot with the bartender, and then commented that they don't skimp on the booze.  She pointed out that it was a 4oz shot that she pours, the only kind they do.  I also didn't pay for that shot.  This place is all about hedonism, fun, non-pretentiousness, and just going for it.  And they look to reward you for being in on it.  If you go here, wanting a foodie dining experience, you're looking for reasons to be pissed.  Accept it for what it is, and love the hell out of it.  I plan to visit again the next time I'm in Vegas.  Absolutely."}

Food deep fried in lard, highest calories, etc.  I don't know about you, but I thought high calorie food was supposed to taste amazing?  I figured since they advertise how high the calories are- that this was going to be the best burger and chili cheese fries I've ever had.  NOT THE CASE!  I came with a big group of people and we all ordered different things, to give the menu a try.  When I got my food, the burger and chili cheese fries were dripping in grease.  The fries had a grease pool formed around them and the chili looked like ground up dog food.  The worst part- the burger and the fries tasted bland!  You would think with that much grease that it would have SOME flavor.  Everyone in our party threw away most of their food.   I will never eat here again.  The only reason why I didn't give this place 1 star is because it does have some one of a kind type of experiences.  The staff give you a hospital gown to wear while you eat and the waitresses are all dressed in nurse uniforms and spank you :).

We didn't know about that added attraction, I can say I'm glad I didn't order a burger just fries because I know I can't eat a lot. I did like the wine IV bag that is a really cute idea."}

Unfortunately, I didn't receive/experience any In-House spanking for not finishing my entree. The ease of eating this monster in the comfort of my own home helped beat the endearment of the local entertainment. I was informed that they will only be able to accept cash, they have ATM's nearby.

She barely checked on us and as I was still eating my fries actually reached and started pulling them away. I had to tell her I was still eating and not done. There were people in there but still many tables open so I saw no need to hurry us off. I also saw other customers had waitresses who were sitting at the table with them being friendly and even bringing a syringe with what appeared to have melted butter or alcohol in it! That looked so cool but we were never offered anything like that.  I ordered the Flatliner Fries and they were fried in pure lard. They come out very black looking burnt but don't taste that way at all and were very good. They cost $1.84. I also ordered a Chocolate  Butter Fat Shake made with pure cream. It cost $4.62 and was delicious!  My man had a Single By Pass and that had 1 burger, cheese, onion and 5 slices of bacon. I tried a piece of the bacon and I have to say it was so yummy I am surprised that don't sell a side of it. This burger cost $7.39.  We liked it a lot and will go back again.  Please note that they only accept cash. The charge for pulling money out of the ATM was .75 cents however my card was charged $2.00. Maybe I read something wrong when pulling the money out.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "According to the news, did you know that two people have died eating here? To be fair though, I'm sure people die in restaurants all the time. I think this restaurant gets the publicity because of their name. So with that being said, let me start my review.  If you are totally sober and coming here for a gourmet burger and fries then you will be truly disappointed.  If you got the drunk munchies and/or want a possibly cool and unique experience then take risk and try this place.   LOCATION - As my wife and I were strolling along near the end of Fremont street (Past  the D hotel) and we noticed a huge scale and a sign stating 350lbs and over eat free. Then we noticed the name, Heart Attack Grill. I was immediately intrigued because I have never seen a restaurant advertise their establishment can possibly kill you. Most other places (Not going to mention names) that rhyme with onalds hide it.   ENVIORNMENT - So we walk in to be immediately greeted by the host. He then makes us put on a hospital gown and bracelet tag. FYI..the gown goes over your clothes. You don't have to get naked. We opt to sit at the counter because there is a gigantic screen behind the bar that plays famous youtube videos. This is one of the videos showing at the time http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg The rest of the establishment is pretty big but the floors looked like it needed mopping. Almost like some real hospitals. I think the fact that the female servers are dressed in the old fashion nurse uniforms who give people spankings gives this scene a better experience. Too bad real hospitals don't do that though.     FOOD - The name Heart Attack matches the food they serve. They have 4 burger stages ranging from single bypass (1/2 pound) all the way up to quadruple by pass which is 2 pounds (What the people who died were eating). We decided on the single bypass because I was just there more for the experience and not a great tasting burger or to die. A Fatty, oily, greasy and messy burger is exactly what I was expecting and that is exactly what we got. I must admit that it lacked seasoning which made it flavorless and boring.  However, I can't dock them too much on that because the burger comes with crispy bacon. Nuff said..   Tip - If you get the Jello shot, it comes in a plastic syringe that you get to keep. Good for frosting your cakes. The shot is pretty strong.  SERVICE  during our time was very good. To be fair, it could have been because we were the only ones at the bar. Our server/bartender was friendly, prompt and knowledgeable.  She also told us that their burgers are not as unhealthy as they advertise them to be or as everyone thinks.  According to her, hey actually don't use lard.   OVERALL I would stay this place is a solid 3  1/2 stars for me but I was torn on my rating because I had great service, and I enjoyed the experience. However, I don't think this is a place I would come back to unless I had to.  I know that sounds contradicting but I am basically saying that it's a place worth trying at least once.  *CASH ONLY* - I know..that's a little weird."}

Bring cash, or use the ATM at the door because they don't take cards."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "**CASH ONLY**  Mediocre food but definitely an interesting experience for when you don't wanna just drink in Vegas.  Located in Fremont Street (The Old Las Vegas Strip), the Heart Attack Grill is a place to go to when you want to be ashamed/spanked for not finishing your food. I can see the appeal here because it's a weird experience that you can say you had - especially when you have to wear a hospital gown while eating your food.  The girls that work here are all dressed up as nurses, while the men are dressed up as doctors (even the busboy was dressed up as a doctor). As well, they have interesting decor such as a painting of Ronald Mcdonald's Last Supper w/ his Fast food friends. They also got some interesting music videos that contain the actual waitresses and doctors working there.  So what makes this place pretty wild is the fact that they will spank you with a paddle and will even let you purchase the paddle they used on you if you don't finish your food. The rule here is that you can't share any burger that contains more than 1 patty and you will get spanked if you don't finish.  Since my friends and I were too scared to get spanked, we decided on getting a single burger patty with everything on it (chili, cheese, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and ketchup) and an order of their fries (deep fried in pure lard baby!).  We also got jello shots.. which were really disgusting but they were cool to take pictures with.   The food wasn't anything impressive and kinda pricy for what it was..but you're just really paying for the crazy experience that you can reminisce on when you over-ordered and are about to waste your food."}

After drinking enough booze to kill an elephant at the Lee's event at the Hilton, my husband and I wanted to run crazy around Fremont Street and zipped in a cab here last weekend.  We were really hungry - and saw this place and decided that being drunk might be the only time we would be brave enough to eat here.  I found it surprisingly pretty decent, not the best burger I've ever tasted, as that title goes to Annie's Island Fresh Burgers on Big Island, Hawaii:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/annies-island-fresh-burgers-kealakekua  They use good quality meat  but char the hell of it to like Medium/Well done, something I wish they would change to make a better, juicier burger.  Don't get anything more than a single unless you want to be sick, it is more than enough food.  I'm under the impression that if we were to have gone there earlier, or at least not on a Saturday night, that the burgers would have probably been a little better cooked.  The fries, however, were very well cooked and very flavorful.  Some of the best I have had in town.  I came in knowing about the hospital gowns and was expecting them, and thought they were really cool.  I'm not sure why people would go to a gimmick restaurant and then complain about the gimmick, but c'est la vie.  It's like when a vegetarian goes to a steakhouse and complains there is no food for them.  If you don't like this sort of thing - don't go.  One big complaint I have is that it was so loud in the restaurant that we even had trouble placing our order, much less carrying on any kind of drunken conversation.  There was a band playing there, who was very good, and all were wearing the standard scrubs and nurses outfits.  It was funny.  But while I appreciate and love live music very much, having to shout our orders at the top of our lungs right into the waitress's ear several times does kind of leave a bad first impression.    Overall this is a pretty decent place at the moment.  They have a few kinks that they need to work out with the noise and ensuring that they cook the burgers properly regardless of the time of day.  But you can tell the owner of this location cares enough to buy quality product and because of that I think this place has a lot of potential.  I am sure we will find ourselves back here some day to see if things have improved."}

We wore hospital gowns and were seated quickly. Our server was friendly and I was not allowed a diet coke or coke zero ... Not enough calories!  The restaurant has tons of comical parody movie posters like gone with the waist line, a hilarious biblical mural of all the major burger chains, more cartoon nurses and mannequins, TVs with music videos of the staff and doctor/owner and news reports and so much more as per my pics. Incredibly stimulating for the eyes!  My partner against crime had the chocolate milkshake which was full of fat and had a piece of butter on top!  I had the double bypass burger and flatliner cheese fries. The doctor/owner brought our drinks out in a timely fashion and our nurse/waitress was superb the whole time.  Our food came out fairly quick. The fries were really good and easy to eat with a giant portion. The burger had large buns and simple ingredients. The meat patties were nothing special. Shake shack or smashburger are much better but it wasn't a bad burger.  Fortunately I finished my meal because if you don't.... You can get paddles by your waitress which was happening right next to us. We saw a little child get egged on by his family to get paddled and he screamed an agony. A military man cried in pain and the most hilarious was two oriental tourists who yelped the loudest I have ever heard. Three fierce paddles that are recorded on a tablet and performed by your waitress.

These meals were so huge it was incredible to think that anyone could eat this stuff. Everything had chili on it and there was not a salad or Diet drink anywhere in the house. They truly live up to it's name. I don't know what is more odd, the fact that they feed customers who are over 350 lbs. for free or that they literally spank their customers after they have eaten. Luckily was not either of the two, but I did manage to eat 90% of my Double Bypass Burger which was humongous. Those in my party could not even put a dent in their literal Footlong hotdog smothered in chili so I took that home and had my way with it. It's taken me about a week to run off all those carbs from that meal alone.

I ordered a double cheese burger with bacon and onion no tomato.  Nope.  I received a double cheese burger with bacon, onions tomato and chili.  If you are inside trying to die of a heart attack why worry about getting the order correct?  The burger was not bad not great.  But the 10 slices of bacon sure made that burger different.  Mrs. K. did not finish her hamburger. Knowing full well that she was going to get spanked by a dwarf in a nurses uniform.  The brave Mrs. K. took her remaining burger hid it in a bunch of napkins and the server dressed as a nurse did not see she hid the burger.  Then we paid and ran."}

It has the potential to be a really cool place, but unfortunately it is a tacky venue with a dead atmosphere and awful food.  I visited this place because I had read about it online where it was advertised as an upbeat novelty restaurant where you can customize your hamburgers to be as unhealthy as possible. Cool so far, right? WRONG! Here is a short list of grievances:  * No credit cards accepted. SERIOUSLY? We are in Vegas and live in the age of Square and Intuit card readers that cost nothing to set up. Judging by the ATM at the door that charges $5 to withdraw money, I say the owner is trying to make up lost revenue from a poorly run restaurant.   *This is supposed to be a novelty restaurant: fun, upbeat and borderline riské with naughty nurses running around. Well, you get none of that.  The waitresses looked like they are miserable and just go through the motions. They are supposed to 'admit' you into their clinic with some fanfare, but instead all they do is put some shady patient gown on you that smell like cigarettes. Nothing like what is advertised  Food: Nothing to write home about. Sure, you get a lot of blah on your burger, but none of it tastes any good. In fact, some fast food burgers taste better. For a burger packed with fatty cheese and bacon it is sure missing the taste and flavor needed to make it memorable.  Overall a disappointing experience. The owner of is placed probably invested millions in all the decor and paraphernalia in the restaurant... He should try to invest some money in training and getting a better staff."}

We saw the signs for Heart Attack Grille and thought it sounded like a fun place with a good burger.  But, first, we decided to check it out on Yelp just to be sure we weren't making a huge mistake.  Just 2 stars. . . . Let's try it anyways - looks cool.  It could have been the pretty girls in the mini nurses uniforms, that tipped the decision their way, but I'm glad we went.  The burgers were good, not great, but good.  The single is plently big enough and has like 5 - 6 pieces of Bacon.  Good, crispy bacon.  Servers were cute, friendly and polite.  My friend found a hair in her burger, they took care of it immediately.  Their chocolate shake was super rich - had a pad of butter on the top.  I wasn't sure if I should be grossed out or find it funny - I decided on funny.  This is really probably more of a 3 star place, but since there are so many other negative reviews, I'm giving them a 4th to help them out.  Don't go here if you are looking for a gourmet meal, great service, or a widely varied menu.  There are soooooo many great restaurants in Vegas for that kind of stuff.  Go here if you are just looking for a fun place with a funny concept.  Think of it like Hooters but with only really big burgers with ton's of bacon."}

You are given a scrub top (hospital gown) to put on,, I can see why, the food can get a little messy.  Our server was AWESOME!!!! She was this tiny petite ball of fire that made my entire dining experience.  When she first came over to great us she quickly informed me that the portions were a good size and that there is punishment if you don't finish your entire meal....So glad she did too, cause my eyes were once again going to be bigger then my stomach.  I get the Chili Fries and a single burger.  It was so yummy. I really struggled to eat it all because I didn't want the spanking that comes with not finishing my meal. I got to watch several people not finish and those gals enjoyed giving them a spanking....not just a little love tap.... they hit HARD!

They also spank you if you don't finish your food -- which was pretty comical when it happened to my friend. Service was friendly and quick too which was nice.   However, I have to agree with a lot of other posters that the food itself is pretty lacking here. The burger was way overdone and pretty tasteless unless you drowned it in condiments. The fries were actually crispy and well done but nothing I'd run back for anytime soon. The best thing on the menu was the chocolate shake which was super rich and creamy.   If you go, I'd skip the burgers, get a shake and some fries and just enjoy the experience."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Ok so what do I say about the heart attack grill?  Well I'll start by saying that this is a very touristy place, it isn't somewhere you would choose to go to every day of the week if you were a local lol  When you enter you are greeted by a guy in medical scrubs who leads you to a little dressing area where you are given hospital patient gowns to put on, then you are led by a waitress dressed as a nurse to your table.  The nurse then gives you your (very limited) menu, the options are a 1/2 pound hot dog with chilli and cheese or the burgers-you can go for the single burger with cheese and chilli or you can opt to go big and choose the double or triple burgers with extra bacon and cheese and chilli!   Oh did I mention that whatever you choose to order you MUST finish? If you don't you will be taken my your nurse waitress to the middle of the restaurant and spanked with a large wooden paddle!! Lol  So I decided to play it safe and opted for the single burger with chilli and cheese and believe me I am glad I did as I struggled to even finish this-but I did :)   The food is as it sounds....greasy, fatty and extremely salty so the heart attack grill is the perfect name for this place, I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate lol   Anyways this place is not for everyday dining but if you are visiting Las Vegas for a holiday, this is a must try place-such a laugh and it's a story to tell!  The only reason I didn't give this any more than 3 stars is down the food-it was the greasiest burger I've ever had to eat and I don't think I would have finished it if it wasn't for fear of a spanking lol"}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "So I came here with some friends recently and we thought to ourselves, hey let's check out Heart Attack Grill! This restaurant is located on Fremont St (the Fremont Street Experience). Once you arrive there, you will notice a HUGE scale in front of the entrance. Apparently if you weigh 350 lbs or more - you can eat free!  But anyways, as we walked inside, the hostess (dressed as a nurse) greets you and gives you a patient wristband that says (I survived a bypass @ Heart Attack Grill) as well as a patient gown. PS - you return those gowns after your visit, too bad we don't get to keep them as a souvenir! :D  As for the menu, for drinks they offer shakes, water, Cola, and alcoholic drinks (in syringe shots). My boyfriend wanted to try the Chocolate butter fat shake. The appearance of it is enough to make someone lose their appetite LOL, but it tasted pretty good. If you want water, they pretty much just give you a water bottle so I don't know about refills.  We both ordered the single bypass cheeseburger. Each bypass is the equivalent of a burger patty. I think the most you can order is a quadruple bypass, in which you get a free wheelchair ride by the waitress nurse. The burger itself was good, but nothing too special. We also had the chili cheese fries, which were also delicious.  BE FOREWARNED (for those who are kinky and/or enjoy crime & punishment) If you do not finish your burger, you are entitled to 3-4 spanks by your nurse waitress. And on top of that, they videotape it for you to watch at home on their main website. Pretty cool, huh? It looks pretty painful. Depending on the nurse waitress you get, some hit harder than others. One of the customers got spanked and the paddle broke, LOL.  But overall, I would have to say that this place is more for the experience rather than the food, since it tasted like any other burger place (except more fattier).  So would I come here again? It was an interesting experience, but one heart attack is good enough for me. :)"}

I wouldn't go here solely based on food, go here if you're trying something new.  I tried a burger and fries, because I'm simple. There was just too much food though! I got spanked :( It was fun though.  Didn't get the name of the bartender but she served us. (The lady on the menu, image below).

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I went to Heart Attack Grill Saturday, Nov 5th at 8pm.  It was fairly busy at that time still.  I had never been there before at this location or any others. The atmosphere was seemingly cheap and temporary, like they hadn't completely finished moving in.  They had video screens and wall coverings that set the tone. The food was pretty good.  It's by no means the best burger and fries I've ever had.  It actually tasted like it was bad for me though!  Not that it's a bad thing...that IS their theme...food that tastes good and is bad for you.  And I love that!! It's refreshing that a restaurant will go against all the outside pressure of healthier food on the menu that some other burger joints get bashed for.  And the fact they give free food to people who weigh more than 350 pounds...I love it! However...my rating is only 2 stars... The service was not very good.  When our order was being brought out the server didn't even know if she had the correct table.  She set a burger in front of my buddy.  He grabbed it the burger, started to take out the wooden stake holding it together, and was going to start putting condiments on it.  The server then was very confused if she had the right order at the right table.  Right before this, they had attempted to give us the order for the table next to us BTW.  The server would not listen to me when I was telling her that I think the other burger/fries in her had was probably mine.  She instead grabbed the burger from in front of my buddy (after he had already handled it of course), and then proceeded to attempt to give it to another table.  Now isn't that some sort of heath code violation...setting food in front of a customer, the customer handles the food, then it's okay to give to ANOTHER customer at ANOTHER table??  I don't think so. And their fries FYI are for a specific fry-type-lover.  Yes, they are cooked in lard, so that makes them taste different, but their fries are the kind of fries that do not get crispy.  They are the soggy, soft type of fries.  So if you are looking for the crispy fries, don't order them. Bacon was the best part. I'd go back, but only with friends who want to try it.  I'd never go back on my own just for the food or experience."}

Before last week I would have settled on a burger from del Taco before I ate here again, but on the suggestion of my friend (who was having his birthday that weekend) I gave the heart attack grill another chance. I don't know what if anything they changed but the food had a lot more flavor this time. For something that purposely cooked in a bunch of lard for the sake of adding a ton of calories the burgers were pretty damn good this time around. Even the chili was good, which I found a bit odd because it looks like the generic chili that wouldn't have a bland sodium flavor but it made the burgers & fries even better.  That being said this is no way a must go whenever I come to visit Vegas, but I won't turn down the idea if some else suggest coming back for a double bypass burger."}

Walked in and received the hospital gown, but no bracelet since mine was still an original from St. Rose. :D   The decor of the place is really unique. Lots of movie posters with the quotes changed to reflect the overall restaurant theme. Waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses and take your order from an iPhone.  Just a note, this place is 100% fat, full flavor. It's not Burger King where you can have it your way. I don't eat beef, but thought I would be able to just order without the beef on it. Nope. So, we compromised and BF and I both ordered single bypass burgers and I took the beef patty off mine and gave to him.  Single bypass comes with 5 slices of bacon. Fries are cooked in lard, and while he loved them, I prefer my fries crispy. Wanted water, but they don't have it, understandable with the theme. No diet soda, no light beer, no skinny cocktails, all full fat! lol   Didn't try their milkshakes because they seemed much too filling.  Honestly, a lot of people think this place is just horrible for your health calorie/fat wise, but you're probably gonna get the same, if not more from ordering a creamy, cheesy, pasta dish from another restaurant, so why not go for the experience?

The menu consists of burgers, shakes, coke, fries, and water. I ordered the single bypass, since I'm not much of red meat girl, with fries and a coca cola.  Overall, the burger was delicious, but I found the fries to be okay. The potatoes here are fried in pure lard in order to make the fries. They looked a little burnt and didn't taste as amazing as I thought they would be. They weren't that fresh either.  The service is okay... nothing out of the ordinary.

I like the idea of the theme, theme restaurants in general and poking fun at high-caloric, bad-for-you food. I found wheeling you out in a wheelchair if necessary,the blood pressure machine at the door, the nurse outfits and the gowns, etc. hilarious! The service was OK, and for the most part they were friendly and happy to take pictures of you. However, the hamburgers were not that great...pretty bland and dry. It's one of those places that's good to just try once and that's it."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "This is the epitome of a successful restaurant where the focus is on everything but the quality of the food. The food isn't really bad... just bland without much selection.  However, if you come for the experience rather than the noms, you'll be happy. First thing they do is force you into a standard hospital gown, which you have to wear the whole time you are dining.  My bae made the mistake of ordering a burger way larger than he'd expected (based on the photo). Let's just say that he was in a food coma the rest of the night, because if you don't finish your food, you receive a loud, public spanking with wooden board by one of the servers.  I made the mistake of only ordering fries (no veggie burgers) while enjoying one of the wine IVs. I knocked out asleep when we got back to the hotel, as well.  If you know me, you know I love unusual, themed experiences. Even though this place supports damaging your well-being by unhealthy food in excess, it's not like people are going there everyday. It's just a theme to play off of, and Heart Attack Grill has developed it eloquently.   I just adore the spoof on the Last Supper painting where they replaced religious figures with fast food mascots and related characters. So hilarious! There's also a lot of karaoke going on, so prepare your ears (and lungs if you're so inclined) for that!"}

But if your homeless and hungry, I guess not. Sad. But okay. It's a business not a soup kitchen. I digress...  Upon entry you are fitted with a hospital gown and wrist band. The servers are all referred to, and dressed as, doctors and nurses. And the menu is set up that way as well (triple bypass burger, flatliner fries, etc.).   The burger was huge, and I only went with the simple single bypass. But it had very little flavor. Same with the fries. I had a water and it was outstanding!  So for the kitschy experience, I'd say everyone should come do it at least once. But once was probably enough for me.   Oh and just one final suggestion: weigh yourself before you go in. You'll thank me later."}

I have to admit at first I was like Really?  You want me to put on a hospital gown? , but it IS Vegas so I played along without complaint and we were promptly seated at the bar.  As a fan of terrible B-movies, I greatly appreciated the gaudy and awful decor of the place...right down to the ripped off movie posters that had been altered to suit the Heart Attack Grill theme.  It was terrible, cheesy, awful....everything a diner like this should be!  Our Nurse at the bar was awesome.  She was cute, sassy, a little sarcastic, and a whole lot of fun!  They serve three classes of milkshakes: naughty, which are essentially your basic flavors, obscene with selections such as cheesecake and maple bacon, and XXX which contain flavored vodka.  We settled on the maple bacon but wanted to add the XXX element to it, so we requested an add of whipped cream vodka.  Our Nurse said no one has ever asked for that before.  I couldn't believe it!  Maple bacon milkshake with whipped cream vodka seemed like a perfect fit to me!  I think they should add it to the menu!  My boyfriend and I opted to share the milkshake, and good thing too!  Sure, it was an $11 milkshake, but they DO NOT skimp on the size!  Plus I'm pretty sure there were at least 6 slices of bacon, half a jar of maple syrup, and a double shot of vodka in the thing!  It was a beautiful masterpiece of everything you shouldn't feed to your body!  Fat, sugar, calories, booze....it was simply beautiful!  If you're truly on vacation and really wanting to do something that is completely Vegas, a visit to the Heart Attack Grill is in order.  Don't expect to have any healthy options.  I've read reviews on here where people have complained about everything being fried in lard.  Duh.  If you expected anything else, you evidently didn't do your research first.  They do have a Vegan menu, 100% pure tobacco....meaning you can buy a pack of cigarettes.  We saw people getting hooked up to wine IVs and folks that didn't finish their burgers spanked with a paddle.  Was it the fanciest or highest quality meal we had while in Vegas, absolutely not, but it was the funnest!  Definitely made the list for a return trip on the next Vegas run!

Which by the way, takes them forever to take your order on, it would be a lot faster if they just wrote it down.   I'm not %100 on Las Vegas Law, but I am pretty sure it is illegal to charge for water if you serve alcohol in your establishment. A friend of mine asked for a Water and was denied any free waters but had to pay for a bottled water. That is crazy.  Now the service was horrible, it could have just been our server because everyone else around seemed to be getting faster service. The burgers are ok, nothing great, the gimmick is they are just loaded with tons of bacon.  Highly recommend you choose a different place.

Every customer has to put on a hospital gown to enter. All the employees are either dressed as nurses or doctors. When you look around and see everyone consistently dressed as if they're in a hospital, it really gives you that novelty experience.  If you don't finish your food, you get spanked by a waitress with a wooden paddle. And they hit HARD! I was expecting it to be a cute little tap, but they really do wack you. The fact that you _have_ to get a ton of food and are actually thinking about the fact that you will be spanked if you don't finish is definitely a unique experience.  It's also fun when a 350+ pound person gets up on the scale in the middle of the restaurant to get a free burger, and everyone cheers.  I just got a single bypass with extra bacon and fries, and was a bit underwhelmed. The taste wasn't distinguishable. It tasted like an average burger and fries. I tried some of my friends chili though, and that had some good flavor.  Note: to my surprise, there were a lot of families/kids around. I was confused about what the kids could eat - a full half pound burger seems like too much - but they let the kids share and I suppose it's a fun place for a kid to be.  Conclusion: Clearly it takes a certain type of person to enjoy this atmosphere. I'm going to assume that you're that kind of person (otherwise, why would you be reading this). With that assumption, I think this is a good choice if you want an experience to remember."}

Outside the restaurant you have the option to weigh yourself before and after the gluttony and when you arrive inside you are greeted by a couple of gals in nurse uniforms and instructed to put on a hospital gown. Ok, I thought, if I spill I am safe! You will be instructed CASH ONLY.   The food is gross. They must make about 500 burgers at a shot because you can't choose how you want your burger done and when you do get it, the thing is a dried out piece of leather. Perhaps that is why they have to smother it in greasy chilli. As well, the 'chilli cheese fries' are some weak, skinny fries with a single slice of American processed cheese sitting under the greasy chilli and not at all melted. Be prepared, they don't even offer ice water so right there is the majority of your bill for just a couple of waters at an inflated price.  My Hubs tells me he enjoyed the meal. I still can't change my rating because a.) he is wrong and b.) the quality of the food is terrible.  The service seems to be good at first, but the initial friendliness of the waitresses is just a facade because the service is awful. Once they have been nice and cheerful with their initial greeting (which can come off as a bit insincere) it all goes down hill rapidly from there.   If you don't finish your burger be prepared to be 'spanked'~ literally. They don't take it easy either, you can sense the sting! We opted to split a single burger which was enough for us, but note they won't split anything more than a single."}

I can't believe that this place was started by a heart sergean! Also, if you weigh over 350 lbs you eat for free....just really bad messages throughout.  The whole idea kind of disgusts me.  I mean I guess most places you would go out to eat are prob not much more lean in cuisine than this place, they just advertise it and use it as a gimmick...but it doesn't make me want to go back.  I guess, if there were ever a city for a cafe like this to prosper it would be in Vegas.  Anyway, when you go in you have to wear a patient smock, which is interesting...at least you don't have to worry about getting your clothes dirty....and all the waiters are dressed like nurses.

If you don't have a sense of humor or If you're a higher then thou health food nut, then don't go. Seriously go eat your box of triple bean veggie burgers, wash it down with a fresh fruit smoothie and crap your pants all night. But if your like most of us and you like to indulge yourself once in awhile and just enjoy the taste of a big greasy cheesy burger and some fatty fries then get your self over to the Heart Attack Grill on Freemont Street in Vegas. The fun starts here before you even get through the door when you can weigh in on the freight scale right outside the entrance and display your weight to anyone passing. And guess what..if the scale reads 350 pounds or above your meal is on the house! Thankfully I did not make weight and the wife did not either, so after getting dressed up in hospital gowns by the rather well endowed waitstaff ( also dressed as nurses) we were brought to our seats. The menu is simple. Burgers, Fries, Non Diet Sodas,Booze and Shakes ...and unfiltered cigarettes ( seriously). You can get your burger as a single, double triple or quadruple Bypass complete with Cheese, Bacon, Tomato, and Sauteed Onions. The Fries are just one size and are fried in pure lard. The shakes are thick and made of butterfat ( and alcohol if you wish) and are garnished with a hunk of butter. Simone and I both had a single bypass with Fries and It was more then enough food. We both agreed that while not the best burger ever, these were still very well cooked, juicy and cooked through and complete with fresh tasting toppings. The cheese was classic American. the bacon was crispy, the onions sweet and the tomato cut thick. The bun was excellent, soft and yet durable enough to hold up under the Burger drippings.  The Flatliner fries, as they are called, were average and not consistently cooked. They were fresh cut but some were crispy while others were more on the soggy side. Overall the Heart Attack Grill was a lot of fun. The food was good comfort food in all the wrong ways, The service was friendly ( in every way) and the atmosphere was unforgettable. Overall 4 stars."}

It was a fun experience wearing hospital gowns and having the unique menu selection.

It's not on strip, but on Fremont in the downtown/old strip area. They are CASH ONLY!! Theres an ATM inside with a $.75 fee (which is the cheapest I've seen anywhere in Vegas)  Let me just say up front that I weigh between 115 and 125 lbs, depending on how far apart my last 3 meals have been spaced apart, and am no where near the 350lbs you need to be to eat free. In fact, I'm no where near what an average person of my height should weigh to be normal, but w/e.  Any ways, If you have heart problems, I suggest you stay at least a mile away from this place. If you're what I like to call a fairy, and eat small portions of pretty food, I suggest you stay away from this place. If you're what I like to call an elf, and eat gross things like vegetables and sprouts and w/e, I suggest you stay away from this place. If you do come in, be aware that keeping in line with the theme of the place, they're gonna put you in a silly hospital gown while you eat. And all the waitresses are dressed in sexy nurse outfits.  The menu is simple, Like at In 'n Out, if you know the place. Theres 4 cheeseburgers, 1 to 4 patties, with or without bacon. Fries, Coke, water, beer, liquor and lucky strike cigarettes (by pack and by carton). I'm not kidding on that last part. The patties are all a half pound each, and they pile the cheese and onions on these babies.  Being a glutton, but not very big, I only got the double bypass burger (yeah, they're named like that) sans bacon and tomato and an order of flat-liner fries. The food came within 5 minutes and after looking at the burger and thinking, oh crap, I started eating. The burger itself was pretty good. definitely not the best, and no where near as good as a gourmet burger, but better than any fast food place and a lot of small burger joints. I was really surprised by the quality of the bun. Now, if I had gotten just the single bypass, this might have been a completely enjoyable experience. But I didn't, so about half way through the burger it quickly went from fun to wtf. By the last quarter I was starting to fade. And I couldn't even get the last bite down. Now normally, I can eat a burger with a pound of meat on it and still get a few beers in. The biggest problem I think, was the amount of cheese near the end. It was just too heavy. So I threw in the towel.  After some research I found out that their biggest burger, a quadruple bypass with bacon comes out to over 8000 calories. Meaning that the double without bacon is somewhere around 3500. I'm glad I didn't find that out till AFTER. Either way, I might come back here next time I'm in Vegas, but stick with the single patty."}

I'll tell you too, I eat burgers. I eat a lot of burgers. Probably 4 or 5 times a week I have a hunk of cow in my mouth.  So my boss and I decided to take off from the base and head down to Heart Attack for lunch on a Monday. When you first arrive, they throw a hospital gown on you and have you take your seat. This is where the first problem shows up: the waitress.  This woman was duuuuuuuuumb. I really hope for the sake of humanity that they make them act like that for tips or something. She was Air-headimus Maximus and would not stop talking. She might be hands down the most annoying waitress I've ever encountered.   I won't mention the out of nowhere 70's music they were playing (is it 70's themed? Isn't it 50's diner themed? Or is it hospital themed?), what I really want to focus on is the food.  I heard they don't serve water, which isn't true, they serve bottled water, so I got that.   The fries, surprisingly, were the highlight. I know some reviews mentioned that the fries were nothing special and didn't compliment the burger very well. But I found the fries to be the most enjoyable part.  And then the burger.....  I got a single bypass (about half a pound of meat with cheese, grilled onions, lettuce and tomato) and decided not to opt for the 5 bacon slices.   I don't know where to start with this burger. Dry/cracking bun, too-tough burger meat, soggy (and kind of gross) onions, and the cheese looked like they laid it on after they cooked it. Everything about the burger looked and tasted wrong, and not wrong in a calorie way, but wrong in a that's not a hamburger way.  I think one of the lower end places I go for a burger is Whiskey Dicks on Craig Rd near the base, and I went there today and was blown away by how much better the burger was.   My boss agreed that Heart Attack Grill is never going to get our time and money again.

I noticed that everyone was having a good time! A lot of people looking in from the outside and taking pictures.   The bartender was a doctor and the wait staff were nurses. If you don't finish your burger, you get spanked with a paddle!  Menu is simple. Burger and fries. How many patties you want is the real question. A good tasting burger with some awesome fries! Coke is served in a bottle and the service was delightful!"}

I was shocked and when I commented, she ran away to get her supervisor. eventually they gave in and corrected the order. Horrible!!!"}

Too bad the quality of food is so poor that you can't even eat it (so everyone gets the paddle), especially the chili, which amounted to oozing grease from chunks of I don't know what.  I don't think anybody comes back here a second time.  If they would IMPROVE THE FOOD QUALITY I think this would be a really cool place to bring out of town guests, because the concept is great and totally belongs here in Vegas!"}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "It's a novelty. A total tourist destination. The ghastily menu sucked us in. No apologies, pure fat and flavor, nicely done. The decor is a bit cheesy, but this aint the Ritz. The nurses don't fall far from the Hooters prototype and they play their roles nicely enough with big smiles, big hair and big visible bustlines. But, what hasn't made the food shows that I know of, is the practice of paddling the patients that don't finish their treatments. This pushes the cheese factor about three levels beyond Hooters. The paddling is popular (and optional). Helped I'm sure by singleness, or alcohol, it seems to be a means to an end for a lot of patrons....but it totally freaked my wife out. It's loud and distracting and focused in the center of the dining area. It's a bit too white trash for my taste. If it's so popular, put it in the corner or in a special O/R room with observation gallery and have at it.   My burger was quite edible. Well prepared and flavorful. It's not Five Guys or Fuddruckers, nor a memorable burger experience to warrant any serious burger crave. But, there is no challenge to wolf it down and they are quite liberal with the bacon. For it's notoriety, it's a harmless tourist experience that doesn't tie up too much money or time. Not a place to take kids or people with closed minds about what restaurants should be, but a worthwhile visit if you're on Freemont Street."}

They are cooked in straight lard and it's one of the worst things I've ever had.

It took 15 minutes after I started paying attention to my watch, in a nearly empty restaurant, in the early afternoon, to get service. We were already standing up to leave when we were approached. They could have cared less and actually got smart as we walked out. Walking out we saw people seated after us had drinks already. Quite interesting.... Just this Saturday night I was with a group who wanted to eat there. I protested but agreed to go. Apparently they were only taking to go orders? On a Saturday night? I give up. Reading these reviews it doesn't seem much like it's worth it any longer."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "After reading the reviews I was hesitant to try this place out. However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was not the tasteless lump of meat everyone said it was, it was a delicious burger that I enjoyed.  The fries were ok; not my favorite, but not horrible.  Very fun atmosphere. My friend and I both ordered the shot specials in the menu, 4oz shots for under $5. We ordered them with coke, and a glass so we could combine them as cocktails. They don't have any ice, so we had warm cocktails by the time we finished. Also when we got the bill, the shots rang up as $9.75! I told the waitress they were supposed to be the 4-something that was advertised in the menu, and she just said no, that is wrong... That was my only complaint about our service.  I would come back here for sure, bringing people who haven't been before. I probably wouldn't go back just to have their food again."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "To begin with, I'd like to say that I'd actually like to give this place 3.5 stars. # is just a little too short, but 4 is a bit too much. For once, I'll err on the side of conservatism.  The bottom line: This place makes a decent burger, and it is what it says it is: a place for purely unhealthy food. You know what you're getting going in, and that's not a bad thing if that's what you want, at least once in a while. Everything in moderation, even overindulgence.  That said, moderation isn't exactly what this place is about. Although you can get a few other menu items, the mainstay is burgers, which you can get up to 8 patties (at least on the menu; I'm sure you can go off the menu and request more). I had the Double Heart Attack with fries and a Coke. You have an option to get bacon on the burger, which actually comes with veggies (lettuce, tomato, and lettuce), along with cheese and chili, but I declined the 10 slices that get added to this particular version. Maybe some other trip.   And I didn't quite get what I expected. I expected some small tourist-size thing. But this was a big fat two-hander on a sturdy, yet tasty bun. It was actually heavy to lift. Rather than ladling in on so in becomes an eat-with-your-fork meal, the amount of chili was just right, a layer the size of a tomato slice. And it was quite good as well, enhancing the already tasty meat. I asked about the chili and it is not canned, but locally made. By not trying to go gourmet or upscale and by not being chintzy with the meat (as you might expect a tourist place in Vegas to do), this turns out to be one of the better burgers in Vegas. Especially as it was late in the afternoon and I'd not had lunch (deliberately, planning for this trip), I was able to finish with room to spare.   Which is a good thing, as it appears that there are consequences of not finishing your meal.   The fries, meh. Freshly cut potatoes, it appears, but not a significant amount, and a bit too heavy on the oil. Get past the oil and they are fairly tasty.  Not being a drinker of alcohol, my beverage options were limited. For soft drinks they have one item: old fashioned bottles of Coca Cola with real sugar, known to some as Mexican Coke. I was able to stretch the one bottle for the entire meal, and was pleasantly surprised to seen the final total at just $15, which for Vegas is a very good deal.  About those consequences. Being the heart Attack Grill, there's a whole medical theme going. The waitresses, seemingly hot young vixens all, are in nurse's uniforms with the typical Vegas waitress short skirts. The bartender was a very friendly and personable bald man, quick to smile, excellent with the service, and dressed in a doctor's lab coat complete with stethoscope around his neck. (When I was ready to order, I at first said, in the most serious voice I could muster, I'll have the salad. He looked at me mor a moment, then pointed and said Get out! then grinned, and I just couldn't keep a straight face at the point myself.) When you enter, you are given a hospital-like wristband and a patient's gown to wear.  And apparently, if you don't finish your massive burger, you'll get spanked by one of the waitresses with a big fat paddle. You might even get one to spank you if you do finish, and pictures of this, uh, abuse seem to be welcome. You can buy a paddle, or even a copy of the menu ($1) if you like. However the business is cash only, ostensibly to make sure your tab is paid should the Heart Attack Grill experience actually give you a heart attack. Interestingly, the bottom of the menu has a snarky conservative-leaning comment about having to pay the sales tax to the government, a not uncommon sentiment with Nevadans, but just days after the Boston bombers were found, cornered, and captured, it occurs to me that those taxes pay for, among other things, the local, state, and federal law enforcement that effected their capture. And that is not a bad thing at all.   As it says on big neon signs on the outside,if you weigh more than 350 lb. *they have scales to check), you can eat for free (provided you buy a beverage). That's an interesting little gimmick that, fortunately, most people cannot partake of.  All-in-all, this is an experience worth repeating, and worth a trip to downtown."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "This is an excellent establishment for what it is: a kitschy, kooky, fun theme restaurant! Don't expect the best food (that's like expecting Chuck'e Cheese's to serve gourmet) but do come with an open mind and an attitude of fun.   Apart from the cash only policy, you are also warned that you might get a spanking if you don't finish your food. Remember, NO SHARING any burger larger than a single! If you are male and order larger, get your butt ready for a spanking!   Truthfully, most guys come in for the spanking. It adds a lot of fun to the place and it's totally funny watching the guys get spanked. The ladies working the paddle make sure to add as much force as they can to the whooping too, you know the guys will feel the swipes hours, maybe even days after.   The staff are all very friendly and efficient. For such a large place, we never had to flag anyone down. There was always someone asking if we needed anything and checking up on how we were doing with our orders.   It was my idea to come here (hey, it's Vegas, and I choose to be stupid with food instead of other, um, pleasures) so I had to order the Quadruple Bypass. The male server actually went, YOU'RE having the quad? in surprise when he brought us the food. :))  Food wise, don't expect anything special. The burger patties are large and dense. They taste ok but we're a but dry. The bacon was really well cooked though. They remained crunchy even overnight, when we checked the leftovers. The hotdog itself was too salty, the mayo and mustard on the table help cut the saltiness.   If you like places like this, go. It's fun and it gives good pictures."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "This place has dude's diner and meat & potatoes man written all over it.  The menu is simple; burgers, fries, shakes, full sugared soda, bad beer and bottled water...don't even think to ask for tap water because you can't get it.  All the burgers vary by size; single, double, triple, quadruple, etc.  Changing only by how many strips of bacon, slices of cheese or burger patties are stacking between the two buns.    I actually lost my appetite before it came time to order.  I could only muster a bite of the hubby's single bypass and a lone french fry, solely tasting for review sake.  I can honestly say the food is trash.  The burger was actually worse than McDonald's and the fries were a joke...so not worth paying $2 for fries off their entirely ala carte menu.  The fries were not at all fresh and I almost wished they deep fried them in bacon fat rather than lard because there would have at least been some flavor to them.  And salt, they desperately needed salt...but no amount of salt could have salvaged the stale, bland taste of those fries.  The whole place is one big joke; from the giant weigh scale at the front door, to the patient hospital gowns patrons must wear and the nurse and doctor uniforms on all the wait staff.  The restaurant is very thematic, they knock it outta the park on that point and I loved the humor in the reciept.  But that's where my love died...of a heart attack.  Cash only."}

You are dressed in a hospital gown as you walk in to enjoy this very caloric meal and there are posters and tvs all advertising the lack of a weight obsession makes for a happy camper.  My friend and I shared the single burger and onion rings. If the burgers came with the actual fillings of a typical burger--meat, cheese, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles--I might have said it was a delicious, fatty burger. But it didn't...no lettuce or pickles to take the brunt of the greasiness of the burger and to cut through, basically, all the fried grease of the onion ring as well. They didn't even have HOT SAUCE! For shame--it really needed it.  I understand the concept--Heart Attack Grill--but STILL!!! Flavor and tartness would've have rounded up this meal in a MUCH more positive light. Also, getting the chance to order a drink out of IV lines--alas, that is a regret saved for another time. I will probably come back because the ambiance of the whole place was funky--but I will be bringing my own bottle of hot sauce next time!"}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Located downtown on the Fremont Street experience the Heart Attack Grill has had a lot of Media attention since its opening back in 2005. This hospital themed restaurant offers an experience you won't soon forget. From the nurses to the pill bottle vodka shots it stays on point 365 days a year. The service however is a bit uncomfortable with what feels like teenage girls in skimpy nurse outfits serving you. Of course the men will still look but it gets weirder when you realize you have the option to be spanked by these young girls. My thoughts on the food are pretty basic and extremely unhealthy. The menu includes the Quadruple Bypass Burger, Quintuple Bypass Burger, Sextuple Bypass Burger, Septuple Bypass Burger, and the Octuple Bypass Burger. These dishes range in weight from half a pound to four pounds of beef. Also on the menu are Flatliner Fries (cooked in pure lard) and the Coronary Dog, Lucky Strike no filter cigarettes, alcohol, Butterfat Milkshakes and full sugar Coca-Cola. For the money you're investing in this meal it is not really worth it for the plain tasting food. My opinion is the Heart Attack Grill is a place that's fun only to say that you've been. However this restaurant is not for the faint of heart. Their moto is Eat, Drink, and Smoke their way to Better Health. But from the overpriced food, inappropriate theme and the fact they lure people over 350lb to come eat free. I think it's best to just keep your distance. Basically the Heart Attack Grill is what it is, a novelty tourist spot. Love, Bug"}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "This was a big disappointment!!  As soon as we get in the door there are two nurses there that were supposed to greet us but decided to stare at us instead. After the party in front of us was seated we finally received some acknowledgement by these two nurses holding up dingy worn out wrinkled faded used gowns which I put on against my will. Then the waitress moved into the dining area about five feet and sat us right behind some professional video gear apparently they are filming a TV show documentary! At this point no one has explained what this restaurant is all about or what the video is all about.    We are left to figure it all out on our own! So at this point we are very skeptical but we venture ahead anyway. We receive our menus and where very confused because there is nothing to it small medium or large that's it? Fries, soda, and beer! At this point I am looking around for the comment card but cannot find one! So from this point on it only gets worse.  So the food arrives and to our surprise there is nothing to it at all. Actually my bun was bigger than my burger with no sauce it was not juicy dripping with fat it was actually dry and over cooked cheap piece of meat in a bun 1.5 times too small for the bun.  So I ordered a milk shake why not! Soon after filming a scene started which was flagged of behind us through a diffused panel. The music was shut off too so no ambient music playing as everyone crowded around near our table to watch a cute skinny girl try and gobble down 4pounds of burger. So I had to wait until filming was done to get my milk shake while the restaurant watched us wait for our food watching this skinny girl try and do the do!  The waitresses are just not into it noir was I at this point. So the last thing that upset me was that when the bill came I threw my card on the table. The waitress says that we are cash only? This made me mad because they failed to explain anything to us the whole time we were there. She even had the nerve to say yeah we have a sign up front that says so.   As a patron I felt cheated out of the experience in every way possible. They left me nothing to recommend nothing except regret!   I will now rate the food on a scale of 1-10 I give a 4.5 unseasoned meat, overcooked and dry. Not even close to a heart attack. The fries are undesirable, too soggy straight from a heat lamp or something. The milk shake was ok I guess but had no desire to finish it based on the other events I was just  not in to it anymore.  The service was a 5 Basically this is setup on hype and cannot deliver on what it promises."}

The only reason I gave 3 stars is, when I tried to take money out of the ATM, I got an error message. So my Fiancé used his card and we thought everything was fine. Come to find out I was charged for the money I never received. I contacted the grill and am waiting to hear back, hopefully we will resolve this quickly and I can up my review to 5 stars!"}

I would've rather had something like a butter bun or a brioche type bun to add to the so bad good for you experience but that's just me.

I should have ordered it with no onions, since they were basically inedible (for me, at least; way too strong and piquant, overwhelming the rest of the flavors), but the rest of it was quite good.

Now, as much as I like my buttocks to be painless, I'm disappointed that they didn't enforce the spanking rule on our table (a friend of mine failed to finish his Triple Bypass and, well, I didn't eat those onions).

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "The Heart Attack Grill is one of those things that you put on your bucket list, but hope that it doesn't actually cause you to kick the bucket. Apparently, a few people have died after eating here. The taboo nature of this place adds to the mystique and intrigue that surrounds it. The world is full of risk takers and many of them are in Las Vegas.   After entering the establishment, we were quickly given hospital gowns and the hospital-like admission bracelets. I felt adventurous so I ordered the quadruple by-pass, which consisted of four half-pound hamburger patties, four slices of cheese and the usual condiments. I decided to not have the bacon slices. Others in the party ordered the single and double by- pass burgers. There's also flat-line fries, extremely high-calorie milkshakes, soda, and other high-calorie, not-so-healthy goodies.  I had to divide the burger in two to eat it - I wrestled with the first two patties and everything above them for round one and then the last two patties and everything below them for round two. I also had a third of my best friend's wife's milk shake and some french fries. The battle lasted about a half hour, but I claimed victory by devouring the entire burger.   There's a large metal scale at the restaurant, which is reminiscent of a livestock scale, that people sometimes use to weigh themselves. I weighed 170 pounds before the feast, and after the feast, I weighed 175 pounds. I was wheeled out of the place in a large wheelchair, which is the reward you get for eating the quadruple bypass. I believe that people who weigh 350 pounds or more eat for free when they weigh-in to verify their weight.   Believe it or not, I'm usually very health conscious, so this isn't a place I'd recommend going to on a regular basis, but I think it's something you should try if you're a hard-core foodie (and you don't have high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease)."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Firstly, this review is an experience, and is not rated solely on just the food.  We arrived and were greeted by the nurse who told us to gown up. This was so amusing because I work in the health care field. We were seated and given a menu. The menu is hysterical because there are no diet drinks, instead their are foods which are given the common stereotype as give you a heart attack such as liquor shots in prescription bottles, energy drinks, huge fatty foods, alcohol in IV bags with your custom prescription name on it.  The rules are that if you weigh more than 350 lbs, your meal is free. They actually have a scale. You also have to finish your meal, and if you fail to do so, the nurse will spank you.. literally. And you cannot split your meal with someone. I went ahead and ordered a double bypass with the works. The food itself is pretty good, but nothing to write home about. It's just a regular, meaty burger you can find at most burger joints. But, don't let that discourage you, the place itself holds a solid theme and I believe that speak louder for the food itself. Again, it's all about the experience.   Everyone in our party finished their meal, but I insisted for the nurse to spank me. What they have you do is bend you over and grab the handle bars. There is a camera facing towards your face which broadcasts your reaction to the TV all over the restauraunt. I'm being complete serious when I say this, but I feel that these nurses enjoy their work and really whale down on you. These girls slapped me so hard, that I had to call it quits. It really hurt. I'm a tan guy, and I walked away red as an apple with blood shot eyes. Perhaps it was the fact that I tried to be kinky and insisted that the nurse assault me that caused them to really unleash it.  Needless to say, the experience was fun for everyone. Our nurse was extremely friendly, and intuitive. We came a little bit after opening, so it wasn't too busy and Rikki, our nurse, sat with us and chatted a bit and told us about herself and the background of the restauraunt.  I recommend coming here and would return if given the opportunity"}

There is a weigh machine inside and can be seen outside  that customers that weigh more than 350lbs eats free. Once you enter, the hostess and waitress dressed in nurse uniform comes and help you get into a hospital gown and a bracelet similar to what you would wear at the hospital. The waitor and waitresses (nurses) take orders (prescriptions) from the customers (patients). Each patient wears a hospital gown before ordering and those who do not finish their meal receive a paddling by one of the nurses with the option to buy the paddle afterwards. I had a burger and I couldn't finish it and had no place to hide it, I tried. The male nurse gave me 3 wacks while my friends videoed me and laughed their butt off. It was all a good fun but man did it hurt!  The menu includes Single, Double, Triple, and Quadruple Bypass hamburgers ranging from 8 to 32 ounces of beef and all-you-can-eat Flatliner Fries (cooked in pure lard), beer and tequila, and soft drinks such as Jolt and Mexican-bottled Coca-Cola made with cane sugar.

We decided to shared a single bypass and a side of fried and saved room for our stomach for a nice steak nearby. Our order arrived to our table fairly promoted. The visual presentation was unattractive. The fried were clearly old and had left out for awhile since it tasted soggy and not crunchy. The single bypass, the bread was half flatten and the patty was dried and over cooked. We felt the burger was cooked by mistake previously and had left on the side for awhile and had it served to us since we decided to shared. The reason being is on the way out, we noticed the other customers' bread was visually looking way better than our. My gf had stomach problem half an hour after we ate and I also felt some discomfort on my tummy.  I'm very disappointed since the first time I went to this exact place, I ordered a double by pass and fried, both were supreme.

When I found out they opened one in Las Vegas I couldn't wait for my next trip to Sin City so I could finally risk my life by eating a burger and fries.  That day finally came!!  At the end of the Fremont Street Experience, I walked in the door and was promptly greeted by one of the sexy naughty nurses. She put a hospital gown on me and asked me where I wanted to sit. Being alone I chose to sit at the bar and be served by the doctor/bartender. All the nurses and doctors were very nice and fun.  I ordered the single bypass, not because I am a wuss by any means, but because I was in Vegas and didn't want to be in a food coma for the rest of the night. I did augment my burger with an order of flatliner fries which are cooked in pure lard.  Honestly, I was a little concerned about the fries. I thought being cooked in pure lard would just make them greasy, but they were actually quite tasty. They are actual cut potatoes and not processed potato parts like most restaurants. They were definitely my favorite part of the meal.  The burger itself was good but unremarkable. I've definitely had better and I didn't particularly care for the bun. Still it wasn't bad at all.  The doctor/bartender tried to sell me on the butterfat milkshake, but I am not a fan of buttermilk. She made me a taste of it and I didn't like it, but while it was not to my taste I could definitely see others liking it. As I said, I don't like buttermilk. If you do, you would probably like the shakes.  Make no mistake though, the true appeal of this place isn't the food but rather the atmosphere. As mentioned before the staff was all very nice and fun.   If you go make sure someone in your party asks for pain management therapy. I am not going to tell you what it is, just that you definitely should have someone in your party do it, and it probably shouldn't be you. :)  Would I go back? Probably not by myself and not just for the food, but if I am with others who haven't experienced it I would definitely take them there. And make one of them get the pain management therapy.

Tell me what is the point of eating so much calories if the food don't taste good why do they have to put these unwanted calorie load when the food don't even taste good.

I decided karaoke or spankings aren't for me so mom and I shared a single burger (it was ok) onion rings (delicious and too many to finish) and a chocolate shake (made with butter)! We didn't drink/eat much of the shake as the texture was lumpy and weird. I was told I'd get a free jello shot since my hands fit in the hand print but never received it. Wine is served in IV drips. I watched several people get spanked (usually 3 spankings that get harder each time- followed by a hug) I am here to tell you I felt those spankings just by being at the table next to the spanking contraption!

When you arrive they put a hospital gown on you and then seat you. This is where the fun begins. Careful when you order a jello shot as it comes in a large syringe that they administer to you (Of course no needle). I ordered the single and left over full. Highly recommended.

The mayo seemed unsafe since it was just sitting out on the table. My friends who were visiting did not like it at all. The fries were 1/2 fresh and 1/2 old and nasty. Your only choice for drinks is regular Coke, bottled water, milkshakes made with butter, or alcohol. No bottled beer, all out of a can, etc. It's a touristy place and really not worth it. If you don't finish your food, they paddle you, which I thought was stupid and nobody at our table was having any of that. Lots better food to be had elsewhere. Oh, also it's cash only, which is inconvenient, had to get $ from the ATM and pay a service fee to do it."}

Just to complete the whole experience we ordered the flat liner fries too.  BAD CHOICE.  The first one was tasty, the ones that followed started tasting more like soggy potatoes dipped in lard.    The quad was just pure insanity and my friend finished it.  D: He liked it but I was on the side ready to jump up if any CPR was needed.  The ambiance was cute.

You will see right on the corner, the famous heart attack grill.  This place is a nightmare for anyone who is trying to lose weight, stay healthy or even count calories. But, it's a great place for the experience and novelty, it was featured in many tv shows!  As you enter the facility, you are greeted by the sexy nurses who give you a general run down of the place. After you are clothed in a gown, you are seated and shown a menu filled with empty calories and lard.  The only burger you were allowed to share is the single (2,500 calories), if you are brave enough to order something else, you might have to prepare yourself for a spanking!  The burger was heavy... Because there was no lettuce, it felt oily and filled with meat. It tasted good, but it left me feeling fat. The onion rings were good and also very oily.   Overall a fun experience and a decent place to dine, but definitely not a place I would like to revisit.  Note: It's Cash Only, if you weigh more than 350 lbs. you eat for free, and you are not allowed to bring your own beverage, and water is only served bottled."}

We are in Vegas to have fun and let loose. Instead we had the bartender who was having a bad night and decided to take it out on the customers. I felt we were under the microscope and she was looking for us to step out of line to release her built up frustration. With so much competition downtown you have to cater to people having fun and not rain on our parade!

It's vegas so we usually eat once and drink all day, saying that we came here to eat a fat burger to fill up the tank.  We came in put on our hospital gowns and got seated, it was my first time so i thought the whole experience was fun.  The nurses were nice and wore their costumes nicely, our waiter happened to be a guy which in the end we realized that's who would be spanking us...wah wah waaahh... total fail! I didn't finish my burger and left just a couple bites , I guess you can say i wanted to follow through with the whole experience.  Biggest mistake ever.  I was the first in line to get spanked, I looked around for a female nurse that i can call out to do the job but before i knew it.. SMACK!!! he went for the kill.  This was the beginning of my end.  I cringed and the crowd which usually make a ooow sound stayed quiet, they felt my pain.  The next two spanks were no different I felt like I would never be able to sit again.  My friends were up and they went through the same, their expressions were priceless but mine was the most painful and we have a video to prove it.  I shoulda finished that damn burger damnit! I would of preferred to be constipated from that tasteless meat patties than to get spanked like that ever again. The food and ambiance are not that great. All in all i can say I won't be coming back here again and if i do it's to get some payback on a poor unexpected soul.  3 stars for the experience. 0 for the spanks :("}

They did not par-boil the potatoes so although they were fried in lard, they were very mushy and came cold to all of us at the table. None of us ate them as we all made the icky face. The sugar Cokes were good, better flavor than the typical US high-fructose corn syrup. Know this novel establishment is just that, novel."}

The staff were brilliant and friendly, and even though it was only 4 on a Monday afternoon, the place got lively. The burger was good, filling and tasty, but the fries were a little bland considering what they are cooked in.

I seen a lot of this restaurant in the news and with all of the controversy surrounding this place I had to satisfy my morbid curiosity.  I had the Quadruple Bi-pass burger with bacon.  I consider myself a world class eater, but this behemoth gave me a challenge, I finished the meaty mound at probably the gain of 5 pounds and a cost of 10 years off of my life.  On the ride back to my hotel I felt my hand shaking, heart racing and my soul escaping from my body.  The burger was cooked well done and there was no option to have the burger cooked any other style.  The flavor was ok I guess, but you can dip dry wall in butter fat and it would taste good. My beef with this place (pun intended)  is how hokey the whole thing  feels, people get spanked, there is yelling and screaming, and it feels like a forced circus that is just trying a little too hard. This is definitely not feel good food. but if you want to see what all the fuss is about then go for it,  its not going to hurt your wallet only your waist line and arteries."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Excess. Schtick. Zero f***s given. That basically sums up Heart Attack Grill.  On the doorstep of Fremont Street, Heart Attack Grill is everything you've heard and more. The scale out front, eating free if you're over 350lbs, the hospital theme, the spankings if you don't finish your meal. This is Vegas excess at its best and HAG knows it. They admit it. They will gladly take your cash (and it is cash only), thicken your arteries some more and laugh all the way to the bank while doing so.   My friends and I stopped by after doing the SkyJump and were eager to fill our bellies after nearly emptying them several hundred feet in the air. We weighed ourselves for laughs, entered and got geared up in our hospital gowns and took a seat in the sparsely populated restaurant in the optimal pre-lunch rush time. We were seated quickly and given menus, which we flipped through while enjoying the culinary sideshow that HAG has made itself out to be. There isn't a large selection, although what they have comes in some very large sizes, the most infamous of which is their cheeseburger with eight half-pound patties and 40 slices of bacon.Vegetarian options? They openly mock this by calling their cigarettes this. Diet pop and light beer are blasphemy here as well. Our waitress/nurse (nursetress?) was super friendly and sat down with us to give us the run down on the menu and how things worked there, especially that if we didn't finish our food we would be spanked with a paddle. And she would gladly do it. And many people over the course of our meal were; there must have been a dozen just when we were there that marched up to the centre of the restaurant, grabbed a hold of the contraption over which you bend over and are video taped on, and paddled...hard. The videos of your face while being spanked are posted on a website for all the viewing masses of the interwebs. Oh, and you can shell out several dollars to buy the paddle with which you were spanked as well, because why not? Another opportunity for HAG to take your money, you filthy animal. Despite knowing the paddling penalty, I made the unfortunate choice to get a side of onion rings in addition to my single burger, which I got chili and cheese on as well.   It wasn't a long wait, but I wouldn't have known if it was anyway, with everything there is to look at here - the paddlings, the classic movie posters that have been changed to be food/HAG related, the Jello shots being given via plastic penises and over-sized needles. On the wall above the counter, two projectors play clips of HAG making the news, giving the ultimate middle finger to their detractors. Remember those news stories about a couple of guys having heart attacks here? Those will play. Eat up, chubby. Overall, the atmosphere is like a frat, diner and hospital mashed together, but the energy is fun and contagious, as every swing of the paddle brings about cringes and cheers alike.   When our food arrived, it was intimidating. My burger was a single but was still a hefty size and the onion rings were some of the biggest I've ever seen, not to mention that they filled their own basket. No skimpy side order of a few rings here. The burger was one hell of a hot mess; the patty was a little on the dry side but the chili was plentiful and good, if not an amazing example. The onion rings started out good, but thick onion rings tend to be soggier anyway, and when you have a big basket to battle through to avoid getting your ass literally beaten, it got less than enjoyable pretty quickly. Luckily there was a bunch of ranch to help the soggy, greasy rings slide down my gullet until the very last one was gone. Having paddled both of my friends, one for not finishing and the other since it was his birthday, our waitress had been keeping a close eye on me as well, but luckily for me and her  tired shoulder, I did finish my meal.  The food was pretty meh, but Heart Attack Grill is a damned fun spot. They're probably not even trying to have good food. The owner has boldly said that he prays for the day that no one comes in his restaurant because it will mean that America has finally gotten its health together, but until then he'll gladly line his pockets with  the cash of funny loving saps like you and me."}

I had heard of the Heart Attack Grill before it came to Vegas, but my wife had not, so we just had to go. Upon entering you are asked wear what looks like a hospital gown. No problem, it's all part of the experience. We were seated next to a window. Cool a view of Fremont street. I ordered the quadruple bypass. A four patty hamburger. Complete with cheese and bacon! This thing was huge! I had to sit back for a minute to decide how to eat this thing. There was a large skewer running down the center of the bypass so what I decided to do was eat half of bypass while the skewer held it in place. Then the second half. it took me a good 45 to 50 minutes to eat the bypass alone. The fries, said to be cooked in lard, were absolutely delicious. After eating my wife and I returned to our car which was parked on the second floor of a parking garage. Climbing just a few stairs to our vehicle, was not the best of options, I was walking very slowly.   A few tables away from us people were complaining about having to wear the earlier mentioned hospital gowns. Are you kidding me? Other people have complained about bad the food is for you health wise. At least the Heart Attack Grill is up front and honest about it. I knew what my fries were being cooked in. No one told me I had to eat there. Las Vegas does have a few other dining options.  Come on people it's part of the experience! Have some fun. As my bypass was delivered and placed on our table, people walking outside by the window noticed my food and pointed at me in amazement. I could read their lips asking if I was going to eat that? I just shrugged my shoulders as if to say, I don't know.  Bottom line, or would that be the flat line... The Heart Attack Grill is a fun place to go, the food is great, the experience, awesome. I suggest the place highly. You just have to remember, you don't have to eat the biggest hamburger possible."}

They all sounded soooo delicious and I couldn't wait to try them all. But once I finally did, it wasn't what I expected at all.   It was around 12pm last Sunday.. We all walked in and were immediately greeted by the really friendly hostesses and were given hospital gowns and bracelets to put on. I don't know about you but hospitals totally creep me out! But since it was required, I obediently put on the gown and bracelet and walked in.   The menu here is quite simple. They have 4 types of burgers, from the single bypass to the quadruple bypass, fries, coke, water, milkshakes, and a variety of alcoholic beverages. They even have a jello shot but that was just too creepy for me. I ended up ordering a single bypass burger with a side of fries and a coke. We waited for a good 15 minutes before the burgers were ready.   Burger: From the outside, it looked pretty good - big, fat, drenched in oil, bacon and chili. I took a few bites and I honestly didn't like the burger at all. The meat had little flavor, dry, and wayyy too oily for me. I know that sounds pretty contradictory.. dry AND oily? How does that work? The burger patty was dry, but the oil was oozing out from the bun, chili and onions surrounding it.. gross! And the whole hospital-like environment didn't help either. It made it sick to me stomach to the point where I had to stop eating. I only had like 1/3 of it.  Fries: I'm a hugeee french-fry person and can normally eat multiple servings of it at other restaurants. That's why bottomless fries are my favorite! But the fries served here limp, greasy, and soggy from the oil when I bit into them.... gross. I had maybe 5 fries and I just had to stop. They didn't even LOOK  appealing - they were all brownish, like they've been left out for a while and not freshly cooked.  I guess the whole hospital thing is what they were going for - even all the staff were dressed up as either nurses or doctors. The restaurant was decorated with hospital props too. But honestly... the ambiance sucked! It was soooo quiet and pretty dead. They had some 90s music videos playing on the big screen but that didn't seen to help at all. The depressing ambience made it seem like I was in an actual hospital.  The only good thing about this place is probably the vodka milk shake. I had a sip of my friend's and it was actually pretty good! Other than that... I'd definitely stay away.   And that article posted by Tiger W... (http://www.ktnv.com/dirtydining/155848485.html) Ohhh my.. You can be sure I'll never set foot here again.  Oh and one more thing...

Per intenderci si può arrivare ad avere un hamburger con nove strati di carne ed una quarantina di strisce di bacon! Unico contro è che qualora tu non finissi la tua ordinazione una delle infermiere ti mette alla gogna e sculaccia con una paletta di legno, anch'essa comprabile a sette dollari... intendo la paletta, eh :) A detta di Ettore ed Arcangelo, entrambi sculacciati di cui uno dei due per scelta, la paletta fa male e la rossa che ci faceva da infermiera sembrava divertirsi un mondo in questo suo secondo lavoro!

We were on Fremont roaming around starved and there was a line out the door because of how notorious this place is. Weigh 350 pounds and eat free? Come on!!! You can even embarrass yourself outside with their massive scale.  Instead of waiting for a table, we sat at the bar which cut our wait time. You get to wear a lovely hospital gown and look a complete mess, but whatever. The menu is hilariously gross; only vegan option is cigarettes and you can get an octuple bypass with 40 slices of bacon. You read both of those right.   Boyfriend and I both had the single bypass, shared a side of fries, and a beer. We should have split a single as I could barely finish 1/3 of it. Oddly enough, that's the only burger you can split; can't split anything larger. Burger lacked flavor to me, even with bacon and chili on it. I did love the bun and the fries were great with my mayonnaise coating (self inflicted). For dessert, because I wasn't fat enough, got the strawberry milkshake. I was in heaven it was so good! I could have lived without the frozen butter on top; didn't add anything but a gross bite and overthetopness.   Creme de la creme of this place is watching gross dudes who have been oogling the waitresses in nurse costumes all night clamoring to get spanked by a paddle.  They say you get spanked for not finishing your burger, but I'm pretty sure it was anyone who asked for it got it. I didn't finish mine, so maybe they lay low with the ladies.

We waited no minutes to get in and made up for it on the inside. Tons of servers wondering around, and all were apparently just power-walking to burn calories because I have family in Wisconsin I see more often than I saw my waitress. Two identical burgers came out separately. She forgot my Dr. Pepper order. Took us thirty minutes to get a check. We could've been out in 20 minutes, instead we were there for ninety. Waitress wasn't even particularly pleasant.  Cleanliness is an issue too. General restaurant wasn't too bad but the men's room is up there with a neglected gas station bathroom. Even the windows looking on to Fremont Street were dirty and smudgy. And if I'm noticing then it's really bad.   Also I want to note that I came to this place for the novelty and the charm. That lasts two minutes. That's not exactly right: the charm never existed, it just takes two minutes to be sure of that. Let me be clear: I like filthy moronic offensiveness. This is just the worst ideas off the sixth grade notebook of a particularly uncreative sixth grader. The abysmal beer list features an attractive waitress with the headline I like it in the can.

We waited over 5 minutes to even be acknowledged by a server, granted the restaurant did have about 20 guests in it at the time. After ordering we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive, I think our server went on break because our food came out at about the same time.   The burgers were mediocre at best but the milkshake was delicious. This was the only positive part of my experience.   So let's recap, the service was obviously horrible which can't be surprising because anyone with have decent skills would not work there. The food was less than satisfactory minus the shake of course and the over-all attitude of the hostess and manager was if you don't like our rules, feel free to eat somewhere else.   Don't worry, not only will I never eat there again, I will be sure everyone I know that comes to town is told to avoid this place.

There were nurses out there but they were cleaning tables up. There appears to be poor communication between the hostess and the waitress. Even though they all carry iPods touch to take your order, you would think this would not be a problem.  During our visit, Epic Meal Time was filming an episode a table away and received a lot of attention from the owner and a few nurses. A lack of service to us was expected because of this. Nothing terrible.  I ordered a Double Bypass with extra bacon. The burger was nothing special. I was surprised by its dullness. I've had some great burgers at other places, for what this restaurant has going on, they should really work on improving their burgers. They lake in flavor. The fries were soggy, I dont know if they were just poorly made or what you get when you deep fry them in lard.  Otherwise, the place was pretty good. A nice challenge for those late nights. I really hope the owner sees that his restaurants keep getting poor reviews and do something about it. I honestly think they have a good idea just poorly implement.  As far as anyone else complaining about stupid things like no diet cola, or cash only, or that you cant split a meal. Srsly? You come to a place called Heart Attack Grill and complain about these things? Get over it."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Talk about food porn.   Heart Attack Grill is pure entertainment, using its controversial menu and suggestive theme to grab patron's attention.   The theme is medical, with your waitresses being (sexy) nurses and the guy at the door being your doctor.   When you first walk in, you are introduced to the concept and menu of the place. ***NOTE: this place is cash only! Lucky for you there is an ATM readily available for your cash needs but I'm guessing it charges.   You are then taken through a door and asked to put your hospital gown on. Then you are taken to your table. The burgers here are appropriately named... Single bypass burger, double bypass, and so on.   The single bypass, which is essentially a normal burger with chili, is in itself a 2,000 calorie dish. THAT. IS. MY. ENTIRE. DAYS. WORTH. OF. CALORIES. but who's counting?! (Me... I'm counting.. And also freaked out). The rest were higher in calories, I heard up to 6,000 for one burger.   We were informed that the single bypass is the only burger you are allowed to share. Reason being, anyone who doesn't finish their burger gets a spankin' (a sexy spankin'?) from their nurse which -- I saw it happen to three people throughout my entire meal -- catches the attention of the ENTIRE restaurant. That booty smacking is loud.   Your cocktails/shots are served in a cute little prescription bottle. The whole restaurant was consistent with theme and that was pretty cool.   Why two stars? Well, I'm not a huge fan of the controversy that surrounds this place. I shared my single bypass burger and fries and didn't even order the chili on my burger. It was good, but nothing spectacular, but that's the problem -- it was just a burger.   The only real spark this place has on its name is the theme (well executed, IMHO, but I'm a huge sucker for themes) and the controversial high caloric menu.   I don't know about you, but I don't think I would put that many calories in my body in one sitting AND overpay for a mediocre meal. Better be the best damn burger for that. Once is enough for this place."}

Sirens went off as the nurse waitresses and doctor owner was cheering him on. Wow....cheering for a guy that is vastly obese.  Continuing about the food, the burger was very tasty which I added 10 strips of bacon to. The fries were soggy and drenched in oil.

The walls are filled with mock movies posters using burgers as the main title. One the back of the wall is the Last Supper painting with all the fast food mascots. The service is by far the best Vegas and the cheesy 80's music videos is a nice touch. What I found funny and surprising is they are playing the news reports about the Grill. As for the spanking, It's awesome. What is the incentive for finishing your food? Most people will leave a bite of food left so they can get a spanking. If you can't finish don't worry, you can opt out of the spanking. This is a must visit in Vegas. Even if it's just once."}

I could not finish because I ordered too much and I passed on the spanking. I'm not willing to get spanked for great food, and the food is far from great.

However, I have accompanied people here to watch them eat the quadruple bypass burger, which is probably one of the most disturbing things you can watch a human do to themselves, but it is oddly fascinating, too.  The last time I went, I was with two Europeans (German and French) who both tackled the quadruple bypass burger.  Nurse Stephanie served us and she really got into the shtick of the place, and was also really friendly.  The Europeans really enjoyed it, and it was a fun way to end their Vegas experience.  I didn't realize it until later, but the Europeans (who are not used to American tipping) only left a 10% gratuity.  I hope Nurse Stephanie sees this and knows that they really did have a good time, they just didn't know any better.  And in case you're curious, the French guy was able to finish the entire quadruple bypass burger (including the very greasy bacon).  The German finished half, and took the rest for later."}

The food was great.  I loved my single and fries, which was more than enough to fill me up.  The burger was juicy and tasty, and the fat-coated buns were amazing.  One of my coworkers ate an entire quadruple hamburger (1/5 pound patties).  Our waitress wheeled his fatass out in a wheelchair.  None of us were big enough for the weight in at 350 lbs or more and eat free.  Maybe my quadruple-eating coworker will work on this.    The service was friendly, efficient, and easy on the eyes. The prices weren't bad.  They don't serve water at all.  I'm not sure that is legal.  We'll see how long that lasts.  Also, the place is cash only (ATM inside).  Plenty of malt liquor brands are offered, but not a lick of quality craft beer.  I guess the really bad part about HAG is how you might feel afterwards.  My stomach is currently upset.  My head is foggy.  I'm pretty sure this review will be poorly written as I can't really focus right now.  I mean, the buns are coated in lard for gosh sake.  Hello cholesterol and sugar overdose!

I really liked the theme and thought it was cute how they had hospital gowns and everything was hospital themed, but unfortunately... the food was terrible.  The burgers were so overcooked and DRY. It was incredibly difficult to choke down. And you HAVE to finish it or else they spank you. I wasn't worried about that at first because I was super hungry and expecting something delicious, but after I took my first bite, I got a little nervous. I ended up spitting half of it out into my napkin because of how terrible it tasted. (Afterwards, we realized that umm... it's not like they can force you to be spanked. You can just say no. But when you're there, it's intimidating!!)  The fries were nothing special.   It's also very weird that they don't accept credit cards. They take orders on iPhones. It's pretty damn cheap to add a card reader to the iPhone. I don't understand what the big deal is.   Cute idea, but they REALLY need to work on their food.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "If you have ventured off of the Las Vegas strip to Fremont and have come into the Heart Attack Grill, you are clearly there for one reason:  a big, greasy burger.  This is not a gourmet burger place.  There is no creativity or flair added.  It is simply a big, greasy burger, cooked in pure lard, and covered in more bacon than you'd like to eat for breakfast after, well, a night in Vegas.  The menu gets right to the point.  I think there are maybe 6 options, not including drinks.  Everything will be greasy and cooked in fat.  I opted for the single bypass burger, which was 1/2 pound of beef, 5 strips of bacon, american slice cheese, and onions.  That's it folks.  The burger nearly slipped out of my hands it was so greasy.  Was it tasty?  Of course.  It was juicy and satisfying, but only in a way that will make you feel like poop for hours after eating there.  (and poop you will!)  It honestly wasn't anything special.  I weighed myself on the way in and out, and between the burger and PBR I gained 2 lbs.  I guess this is kind of the point of eating there, really.  After all...you put on hospital gowns when you're seated.  I saw a lot of people trying to eat the triple or even quadruple bipass burger.  Most people looked like they wanted to die and were maybe halfway through.  I don't recommend this.  The only benefit of eating the giant burger is that if you finish, they will wheel you back to your car/hotel in a wheelchair.  I understand this place has a lot of bad publicity due to it's clearly awful food for you.  People have actually had heart attacks there.  But, in full honor of America, this place will serve you potential-death on a plate and even serves you for free if you weigh more than 350 lbs.  I don't agree with this encouragement of handing really bad-for-you free food to an overweight individual, but if they are there, it's their choice I suppose.    Honestly, check it out if you wanna say you went there.  Get the small burger.  Feel like crap for a few hours.  Tell your friends.  Never go back."}

Scott had heard tales of magical machines that sometimes, but rarely gave you money if you pushed buttons on them for long enough. Scott heard of ladies that wore very little and drinks that were very large. He also heard tales of burgers the size of a small child and it became his quest while in this strange land to track down, and devour one of these famed burgers.  Not deterred by the reviews of a mixed nature to be found on the magical tome known as Yelp, Scott set his sights on the Heart Attack Grill. Neon signs beckoned him forth. Posters in the windows told him that alcohol was good for him. Scott agreed. He stepped through the doors, with his beloved (and vegetarian) wife in tow, and was promptly greeted by a young lady in a nurses uniform. This was not like any nurse Scott had seen before. Nurses dressed in such skimpy attire in the strange land of Vegas. Upon being greeted Scott was cloaked in a surgical gown that no doubt had magical properties and was led to his waiting table.  The Grill was quiet, for it was late afternoon on a week day. Scott ordered a Double Bypass burger and when asked if extra bacon would be required Scott answered Yes, yes it will. Scott's wife, the vegetarian Leisha, simply smiled and ordered a large beverage of an amber liquid known as beer.   Before too long the burger had arrived. It was as large as the fables had told and Scott was quite pleased, though a little shocked. Scott was not expecting the food in this strange place to be of what looked to be good quality. The fries looked crisp and brown and tasted slightly of lard. Lard is good.  The burger glistened in the light. Scott looked around the room at the images on the wall that parodied films of yesteryear and smiled, then picked up the weighty burger with two trembling hands and took his first bite. It was good. Very good. Surprisingly good actually. This challenge would be a welcome one with such delicious treats on offer. Leisha asked Scott how his burger tasted as she sipped from her mammoth beer. Delicious was Scott's reply through mouthfuls of juicy meat before diving back in.   Before too long Scott was halfway through his burger and he was beginning to falter. But Scott's will was strong. He could not return to his home in Australia letting this challenge best him, so he bunkered down and dove back in. The burger was rapidly decreasing in size, as Scott felt he was rapidly increasing in size. And then, with one almighty fist pump the final bite was downed and Scott was victorious. He was elated.   After an appropriate resting time Scott rose to his feet and felt several kilograms heavier as he waddled to the door and the outside world with a grin on his face and a cow in his stomach. Victory was his, but it was not the poor gentleman's who was currently bent over a table being spanked by a nurse."}

About their Guinness Book of World Records-backed claim as the unhealthiest restaurant on the planet. If there was ever a restaurant that truly deserves to be in Las Vegas, it's this one.   But is it any good? Well I went in to find out.    This restaurant is truly an experience. You are greeted at the door by sexy nurses who dress patrons in hospital gowns. Wine is served on an IV drip and shots are given on injections (or pill bottles). Can't finish your food? (Likely, as the portions are huge) The nurses will bend you over a rack/torturing device and spank you with a paddle. Hard.   There are essentially two entrees: a huge chili dog and the bypass burgers that go from the one-patty single bypass to the quadruple bypass and beyond. There are no substitutions. You want bacon on that double bypass? Then you get 10 slices. No compromises. Do you weigh 350 pounds or more? You eat for free.  I ordered the double bypass and could barely get a whole bite in my mouth.  How others are able to consume the larger burgers, I can't imagine.   But are they any good you ask? Well, yes and no. There is a point of diminishing returns. I thought it was a pretty good burger and the flavor of the chili fries we ordered was just right for me (my brother/accomplice thought they needed more acidity) but eventually all the lard and fat giving the food flavor does catch up with you and coats your stomach and mouth to the point where you want to stop. It was precisely at that point where, while struggling to finish our chili fries,  we witnessed a man and woman get spanked for not finishing their food. It was no joke. They got decked pretty hard and we promptly cleaned or plate.   Even with that, I can't help but recommend you visit this joint. It's a whole lot of over the top fun and when you're in Vegas, that's kind of the point. Besides, the mural depicting a very funny (and very politically incorrect) version of Da Vinci's The Last Supper, along with the rest of the decor is worth the price of the food alone."}

As I am eating my burger I take another bite of this monstrosity and as I am pulling the burger back from my mouth a piece of hair is flossing between my teeth.  Disgusted and embarrassed, because I have been bragging about this place since the last time I visited Vegas, I informed my waitress of what I have found. She went to the manager and the manager stated we will make you another burger.  I stated that this was not acceptable and I would like to speak to the owner.  When I spoke with the owner, I stated my admiration for his product and his business, and that the burger had hair in it and I will gladly pay for all of the other burgers drinks etc. at my table (2 single bypass burgers, 4 jello shots, 4 drinks, 2 beers, 1 double bypass burger) but would like him to comp the hairy burger. He responded  by saying in his 15 years of business he has never fail for the hair in the food routine and he wasn't going to start now.  Now mind you, I am bald with a goatee; the hair in my food was a long black strand of hair, so where would I have gotten the hair from?  I stated making me another burger, where you could sale to another customer for $15, would still indicate a lost in your profit.  Refusing to work with me on any avenue; taking the burger off my bill, even stating that I could pay half of the burger, shows that this guy is hard up for money and doesn't know how to properly run his business.  I had the waitress separate the burger from my bill and paid for everything else. As I was walking out of the establishment, the owner physically assaulted me, by grabbing my camera strap that was around my neck. The Security guard had him release my camera strap and as I was stating what happen, the owner step up to me and tells me to shut up. It escalated to the point to where one of my friends in my party had to restrain the owner while the security guard restrained me and escorted me out of the establishment.  Needless to say, I will never be visiting the Heart Attach Grill in Las Vegas ever again. I am pressing charges against the owner and contacting the Vegas food board about the unsanitary hair in the food.  If this was supposed to be part of the experience then they need to warn the customers; you may find toe nails, head hair, and pubic hair in your food. We will gladly make you another one at your expense, because you put it there even though you're bald and none of our staff wear hairnets when preparing or serving your food.  Buyers beware......."}

Die Bedienungen waren echt freundlichen und hilfsbereit. Zum Essen selber, einfach klasse. Ich esse echt gerne Bürger & um so größer der Bürger, umso besser. Uns hat der Bürger sehr gut geschmeckt. Es tropfte kaum Fett raus, wie man es bei manch anderen Bürgern kennt und geschmacklich war er auch super lecker.die Frage stellt sich nur, wie isst man solch einen Riesen Bürger ( hatte den Double )!?? Aber hat gerade noch so in den Mund gepasst.   Aber Vorsicht, wer was gesundes möchte, ist hier falsch.  Wer in Vegas ist, kann ich nur empfehlen, einen Abstecher in der Heart Attack Grill zu machen, es lohnt sich!!!! Preislich der Hammer und so etwas gibt es nur in den Staaten.  Ps: wählt mit Bedacht die Bürgergröße aus, oder Ihr bekommt eins auf den Hintern!!"}

On order consisted of a hot dog, triple burger with 15 pieces of bacon, double burger, single burger (2), chili fries, regular fries, 4 sodas and a shake (not so good). All of this cooked in lard.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "If the food were a bit better, I'd give it five stars.  The place is a gimmick restaurant, and it's in a city that is perfect for it.  Some people love the gimmick, some don't, hence all the negative reviews from people getting worked up about not having $10 burger quality in their $8 burger (probably about $4 burger quality).  Oh yeah, they're cash only too, so keep that in mind before showing up with only plastic.  So, with that being said, if you buy into the gimmick, how can you not love the place?  I'm a child of the 80's, so I grew up in the hair band and real hip hop era.  This place has tv's scattered about all over the place playing mostly music videos from that era, from both genre's, so if you are in your 30's, you'll probably really enjoy yourself with the music selection.  If you don't care about that kind of music and just love to booze, this place is still great compared to the other options in and around downtown Vegas.  Their shots are expensive, but their shots are 4 ounces, so compared to the 2.5 shots you'd have had to purchase elsewhere, you come out a bit ahead here.  You can mix your shot with whatever mixer they have, including frozen drinks and several sodas, none of which are prefaced by the word diet.  The shot is delivered in a medicine bottle with a personalized prescription on it.  I personally drink the frozen margaritas; the mango is really great.  Gets me a little tipsy and then I go lose my money at the craps table.  Other drink options?  Continuing the theme, they of course have five or six brands of malt liquor if you're feeling ghetto; these include Olde English 800, Colt 45, etc.; all in cans that come in brown paper bags of course.  They have a vending machine that sells unfiltered cigarettes, and candy cigarettes if you just want to pretend to destroy your lungs.  The servers, i.e. nurses, will spank you if you don't finish your food, or they'll just spank you if you ask them to; it's a great challenge amongst a drunk group of guys as to who can withstand the most punishment.  You'll see people from all walks of life in here to get a spanking so don't be surprised if you see something completely unexpected.  Now the food.  Yes, if you weigh 350 pounds or more, you eat free.  Their burgers are run of the mill; about what you'd get at a Waffle House late at night; i.e. you're not going to make a trip just to eat here.  It's food though, so combined with the entertainment and booze, it gets the job done, just doesn't make you call your mama and tell her how great it is.  One last thing; if you're a bleeding heart liberal, you'll probably be offended by their receipts.  Where the receipt would normally report sales tax, the text has been replaced with Obama's cut."}

By the end I was getting into the whole touristy thing with you have too were hospital gowns or not going too let you in (I have mixed emotions on it; we made most of it little food fight sprayed each other with ketchup and mustard all over it), the waitresses all dressed up in nurses outfit, doctor dressed up, wheel chairs, paddle, and some people think corny but adds too the Heart Attack experience.  I had the single burger without the bacon. I know going soft but thinking more drinking not overload on food night was early. It was pretty tasty burger. It was cooked perfect. The bun nice and toasted. Talk about size god the single could be doube-double at In-N-Out. Yay it oversized burger but unlike most oversized burgers this burgers had great flavor. It not all about the amount of meat shove down (it is option if you choose) but fact the patties have nice flavor. Different. The fries were good too. No way going too fit in shake.

It is a slap in the face to the hyper PC culture on the news and current hyper PC and ultra biased liberal arts university culture.   Honestly, I cannot think of a time I've had more fun in a restaurant in recent years! I was scared to go in because I didn't want to wear the hospital gown, but I got over it and had a blast!   This is essentially like a dinner theater, it is a total show and like being in a different universe, once you step back outside, it is as though you came out of a bizarre 1980's movie, it's that stark of a contrast.  The food is not mind-blowing, but decent overall, it's not cheap, but keep in mind your not just paying for food when you come here, you're paying for the experience, the show, if you don't like that kind of thing, don't come here.   My hot dog was great, so much so that everytime I eat hotdog now, I think about that hotdog, it didn't seem very high quality written I ate it, not until I came home and ate other hotdogs. :-( The chili and cheese was okay, but the french roll bun and hot dog were very high quality. My husband said his burger was good, he didn't have the bun because he is on a keto diet, which this perfect is pretty awesome if you are keto, he said the meat and bacon were very good. The onion rings were good, I could definitely taste the difference with the lard, and contrary to the popular notion, lard will not give you a coronary necessarily, it is one of the best frying oils, much healthier than soy or canola. That alone is selling point for me(by the way I am in NO WAY saying this place is healthy, it's obviously not! Just merely that lard has an unfair rap due to the war on fat from the 1970's on.).   I loved the whole experience, I enjoyed my food, I didn't finish, but no they didn't threaten to spank me, it was 100% tongue-in-cheek, from the costumes, to the tasteless music videos and posters, it is a lot of fun, and honestly, in today's society, we need people to have fun and have a stinking sense of humor more without picking the experience apart. Just and enjoy! For $30, we honestly got 3x's they food of most burger joints.   God Bless ~Amy   PS: There is a guy who has complained about the security guard not letting them bring in their drinks, I was there when it happened, and this is true, his wife had a lemonade cup that they were unwilling to dispose of when the security guard asked nicely, this he had to deny them entry. The security guard was doing his job which was to stop people from bringing in outside drinks( which in Vegas is usually alchohol), I talked to the security guard for 30 minutes before going in and he was beyond pleasant, he was super friendly, but he was all business when dealing with people trying to bring in drinks, that was his job, to stop people from bringing in drinks. The man who wrote that review below was very disrespectful to the said security guard and very rude with some unsavory words, not the other way around."}

You go to this restaurant for the fun factor.    The food is a bit expensive for what you get, but considering the experience I'd honestly pay double.  They only accept cash, they offer wine in an IV bag and cheap beer straight from the 24 ounce can!  The food is very basic: hamburgers, hot dogs, milk shakes, fries, beer, and cheap wine.  If you weigh 350 pounds or more, you get your hamburger and fries for free.  When you walk in the door, you are checked in to the hospital with a hospital admission wrist band and a hospital gown.  All of the staff are very pretty women dressed as sexy nurses.  The sexy isn't over the top, so there were a lot of kids there.  You're seated, place your order, then your food arrives pretty quickly.   We ordered two of their standard hamburgers (one way bypass) with fries and a PBR.  I think our bill was around $30.  You'll be plenty full after your meal because everything is made without worrying about calories.  If you don't finish your food, your waitress will ask you to move to the center of the restaurant for a spanking in front of everyone with a wooden paddle.  Of course, you can decline.  The waitress prepared to paddle my wife and I yelled spank her hard!  She was spanked normally just like everyone else.  When it was my turn, the waitress insisted on spanking me 3 times.  I'm certain that our waitress played softball or tennis because she damn near broke the paddle on my butt.   The manager (I think her name is Tracy) was so nice to us, and chatted with us during our entire meal.  We had a terrific time and we'll certainly go back next time we are in Vegas.  By the way, this is Vegas.  If you are in Vegas, I hope you have a sense of humor.  It's a town where trucks with billboards drive up and down the strip offering girls to your room tonight, the casinos are filled with smoke, and people hemorrhage their life savings every day.  Heart Attack Grill is a nice break from all of that.  It's just basic American greasy food served by sexy nurses who spank you with a wooden paddle if you don't finish your meal.  So, go to the Heart Attack Grill- and ask for Tracie.  Tell her that you want one of her special pina colada jello shots.  Trust me, you'll laugh until you cry.  Get a burger, try to finish it... or don't try, if you're into that."}

Also, I never write comments but this had to be said.  Earlier this evening (10/1), I went there with my boyfriend and daughter. We we at the f*ck it, lets try it out point, can't go wrong with burgers and fries. Looking on the outside vinyl at specials and prices for the burgers. The menu with prices were on the inside so we walk right in and look at the menu. Not even 30 seconds of being there or even getting a full look at the menu, the host, notices we have an outside drink, and asks us to step outside to finish them before coming back in. We literally just walked in the door and the boyfriend said after being asked to leave oh ok, no problem, we just wanted to look at the menu During mid sentence of my boyfriend saying that, the host replies sir, outside. You are not allowed outside drinks in here I look at him with an are you serious look while trying to look at the menu at the same time but it is also hard with holding a hungry 2 year old. Moving forward, not being there for even a minute, we start turning around while still trying to look at the menu. We are very respectful in obeying the no outside food or drink rule in an establishment but as soon as the host said Sir, Ma'am. The door is right there. You can look at the menu from outside I flipped but in a professional manner.   First, I asked him where the sign was for no outside food/drinks, there was none or he didn't know where it was because we obviously didn't see it. Then he goes on with attitude, I might add, of how disrespectful I'm being towards him and how rude I am? I still had my 2 year old, who has been up all day and eating was our last stop before home.  Second, there were guys inside staring at the menu with beer in their hands, which was obviously from outside but I don't hear him telling them to look at the menu from outside. All we had was a half full soda while these guys had a full on beer, each.  Lastly, of course I wanted to speak to their manager about their hosts' customer service skills but the host didn't want to go get them. I could have made the scene worse but I didn't bother, we finally left. The entrance was small and crowded for 7 guys, me, a 2 year old and a host.

When it comes to food, taste and quality of ingredients etc I really do care a lot.   The burgers they served were piece of crap, the bun was bad, the beef patty was dry and the grilled onions didn't taste like one.  They just put dry bun with dry patty and 6 slices of bacon and some grilled stuff and call it a burger. It doesn't get any better no matter how much mayo or mustard you put on it. I have had far better burgers at regular fast food chains like Carl's Jr, Smash burger, Five guys and even Mc Ds. This place is totally not worth the drive from the strip and the money.

Also, it was close to home, so I figured WHY NOT!  We walked in expecting the place to be BAWMPIN'.   Unfortunately, it was lunch, and a weekday, so maybe it was our fault for picking a bad day.  The tables have full rolls of paper towels, and bottles of ketchup, mayo, and mustard. I got anxious looking at everybody else's orders, but I have to say that the setting made me a bit uncomfortable.  Firstly, I don't like the idea that I'm wearing a hospital gown that was probably worn by hundreds before me,(EVEN IF THEY WASH IT, ugh. I'm a germophobe, sorry) and to be worn on top of your clothes in the hot hot hot summer of Las Vegas... being sat in a sunny area of the restaurant... blahblahblah, I know I'm complaining, but it's what stood out to me.  Anyway, I'll make it short. The burger LOOKS amazing, but the taste... eh.  I got the double with bacon and fries. (I'm little but I can eat!)  I prefer my burgers medium, and theirs were well done, NO PINK! BOO! At first bite, I thought Hmm, this could be amazing but it was a little dry, so I added some ketchup. It was a bit better. Upon taking a few more bites, I started feeling like all I was eating was a dry, overcooked, hockey puck of beef, with no seasoning, no nada. Also, the fries... SOGGY and not very good! :( i was utterly disappointed.  BF and I also tried the shakes. Very good, but with a big, tasteless burger, and soggy fries, I wasn't impressed.  I think the shakes are the only thing I'd go back for.  PS. They only serve bottled water, no ice water, so keep that in mind if you plan on eating here."}

They put you in a hospital gown when you walk in which sets the mood for a very fun experience.  All of the staff are very nice and friendly.  You can watch or participate in karaoke as you are waiting for your food.  If you don't finish your food you get paddled before exiting.  Overall just a great and fun place to be if you are looking for something different to do one night in Vegas.  The burger itself was slightly above average, but nothing special.  The meat tasted bland and was overcooked.  The bun was too thick and overpowered the taste of the meat.  In the end it turned out to be an ok greasy burger, but was forgettable.  The size of the burgers is definitely not forgettable and even a single patty is very big.  One person in our group made the mistake of ordering a triple which was the biggest burger I have ever seen.  It was a nice change of pace from the casino/club setting and I am happy we stopped.

Catering to the hefty hearts of the typical American, Heart Attack Grill offers a free meal for those over 350 pounds. In fact, they've got livestock scales in front and inside the restaurant for those up to the task. With servers dressed as scantily clad nurses and the owner, Jon Basso, dressed as a physician prescribing nutritional pornography, it's essentially Vegas personified.   So while touring Freemont Street, I couldn't help but stop by with the GF's family. I mean c'mon. The Last Supper depicted by America's favorite fast food icons? Consider me sold and uptight cynics be damned.  Single Bypass Burger [$8.33]  The GF went with the single bypass burger, which was surprisingly decent. While the cheese could have been melted better and the bun was a bit tough and flour-dusted, the beef was well-seasoned, with the chili sauce making each bite.   Double Bypass Burger [$10.18] + 10 Bacon Slices [$1.85]  I went with the double bypass burger, along with 10 slices of bacon. While the cheese could have been melted better on this burger as well, the chili sauce helped to make each bite nicely juicy.   Fries [$4.63]  The matchstick fries were good - crispy and well-seasoned.    Onion Rings [$6.48]  The onion rings were heart stoppers - literally. Deep-fried in pure-lard, they had a nicely crisp beer batter crust.  The seemingly sweet servers? Not so sweet if you don't finish your meal. The punishment? They get to spank you three times in front of the entire restaurant. I kid you not, these are not light swats.   How do I know this? I finished my meal just fine. But after a trip to the restroom, I saw the rest of my party's meals somehow placed in front of my seat. With a twinkle in her eye, our server called out or me while patting her paddle. Let me tell you, I felt it the rest of the day.   So if you're by Freemont Street, looking for an experience, and aren't uptight about life in general, check out Heart Attack Grill. It's not about the food, though surprisingly, it wasn't half bad. Rather, it's about living a little and trying something wacky. Or getting whacked."}

The table next to us got a septuple-bypass burger: a towering stack of meat and cheese that started leaning and then finally tipped over shortly after the pictures were taken (I uploaded one of them!). It's certainly a novelty.  As you know, they stick you in scrubs when you arrive and the waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses who offer deceptively strong spankings with a paddle if you finish your meal. My brother partook...I chickened out after seeing the intensity of the smacks!  Rounding out their theme of encouraging vices, they offer cigarettes on the menu. But then they chastise you for smoking. Baffling.  I'm anxious to know if their original location is better. Unfortunately, this Heart Attack Grill was deeply disappointing."}

Well I was very disappointed. The waitress was not pleasant but not completely rude. She just seemed like she wanted to go home already. I'm sure it was because it was almost the end of the night. I just feel like we did not get the experience everyone was so hyped up for. We came from Chicago to have a good time and we didn't get that. The food was not the greatest either. Definitely was not worth the money."}

You get a better tasting burger from Carl's Jr or In N Out.   First of all NO FLAVOR what so ever, burger not cooked, they say lettuce isn't healthy but they offer tomatoes and onions. They use a poor quality meat, but the bun was good. Their onions rings were the best part of the meal.  The waitress was very friendly and took my burger off the bill because it wasn't cooked. We won't be back and won't recommend this place to our local friends or family"}

Apparently if the shake was any more creamier it would just turn into straight lard, all my friends were pretty disgusted with me finishing the thing but it tasted pretty good for the first half sip and I only did it because I was raised to clear my plate.  The burgers here are extra unhealthy and that's this place's draw, people who just want to eat like crap and don't give a damn. Pretty sure the burger shaved off a couple months of my life too.   The waitresses kind of act like they don't want to work there, and the place has a dragged down feel to it, at least in the day time.   I kindda liked the novelty of this place, and how it says that if you weigh over 650 lbs or so you eat for free, although I've read in the news that several of the people who were eating for free here died very early. Not to insult their memory but it's a lifestyle choice and if they respected it themselves, I respect that.  Outside they have a buncha warning signs saying that this place could kill you, which I thought was funny.  If I ever come back here and any of the people in my company would like to try it out against my recommendation, I'd probably buy the biggest burger, the quadruple bypass burger I believe, I'd scarf down that monster just to show that I can do it unphased.  That or maybe after scarfing it down I end up in the hospital- a story to tell nevertheless."}

The waitress came over and demanded she put it back on. My Mother declined and explained her situation. The waitress didn't care and went to get her moron manager who was dressed up like a doctor. The same transaction took place between him and my Mother and he kicked her out of the restaurant for not putting it back on. We were all stunned to say the least.

Las hamburguesas aunque sin duda no fueron las mejores hamburguesas de mi vida, si tienen un sabor especial y muchas calorías.   Lo único que no me gusto es que, no te permiten compartir las mega hamburguesas, entonces cada quien tiene que ordenar la propia. Nosotros íbamos con la idea de comprar la mega hamburguesa como con 5 carnes pero para compartirla con toda la familia y no se pudo por que no se pueden compartir.  Lo gracioso del negocio es que la gente que no se termina la hamburguesa gigante puede ser golpeada por las enfermeras en el trasero :O. Y claro que todo el establecimiento se llena de carcajadas.

This place is known for their ridiculous portions, large calorie intake foods, shakes made with lard, fries deep fried in oil and fat, huge 1lb plus burgers smothered in chili and pounds of bacon. Mmmmm sound awesome, sign me up. Well we get seated and I'm not sure if it was the hospital gown I wore or the thought of having a heart attack, that made me nervous. We ordered the smallest burger they had, an order of fries and 2 bottles of water. We both were barely able to finish the food, with some help from our friends. (Didn't want to get spanked with a paddle in the middle of the restaurant) The food was ok, nothing special. The food tasted like most hamburgers and fries I've tried, minus the massive gut bomb/ heart burn icky feeling I felt about 1 hour later. Uhhhhh I was sweating fat in the cool of the night.

From hospital gowns and nurse-waitresses to alcoholic drinks administered via IV bags, pill bottles, and syringes, and sprinkled with the occasional spanking that turns heads, the atmosphere was lighthearted and fun. I've never felt more American in my gluttony than at this place. The food, though made to be overly fatty, was actually tasty. Good patty, great bun, taste was not sacrificed at all.  Aside from the food though, I loved the burger infused movie posters and famous works of art like Salvador Dali's burgers (not Clocks) and the blasphemous Last Supper painting with Bible figures replaced with notable fast food icons.  Surprisingly funny and not at all what I thought came with the experience of the Heart Attack Grill was the anti-government sentiments. All in good fun, I'm sure. Obama pictures in the urinal and Obama's cut as the tax label on our receipt were knee-slapper moments. It was an experience I enjoyed, to say the least. Do it once. You'll be fine. Haha"}

The burger at Heart Attack grill is not that good....you would think that a place that has only a burger and hot dog would find some time to perfect these, but this place seems to be more about it's overall concept than the food.  I got the single burger and regular fries.....I did add bacon.  The burger was really tiny, the bun completely dwarfed it.  There was an inch radius between the burger and the edge of the bun.  The red onion on it was cut way too thick, so every time you bit into the burger, it tasted very strong of onion (I love onion btw...so the onion has to be super strong for me to make this comment).  The fries were old and cold....they  had to be sitting out for at least 30 minutes to have that consistency and temp.  The chili on the burger looked like baby poop.......the best thing on the table was my bottle of water.  With so many good restaurants in Vegas.....this one should be avoided.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Okej, här kommer en svensk recension av ett ställe som jag hade hypat för mig själv (och försökt hypa sällskapet) ett bra tag innan senaste USA-resan.  Heart Attack Grill serverar precis vad du tror: burgare i 10000 kcal-klassen varvat med milkshakes toppade med smörklickar, pommes friterade i rent ister och shots i dildosprutor som sprutas i munnen av servitrisen. Ägaren och kocken, Dr. Jon Basso följer sin vision och hymlar inte med att dessa burgare är dåliga för hälsan... ett antal talespersoner för restaurangen har redan avlidit (givetvis inget direkt samband med Heart Attack Grill). Jag skulle kunna skriva kring detta halva natten men dags att recensera besöket!  Tillsammans med två vänner besökte vi restaurangen den 26/6 vid tretiden på eftermiddagen. Vid entrén tilldelas alla patienter (vi) patientkläder av sjuksköterskorna (servitriserna) vilka ska bäras under hela besöket. På menyn finns hamburgare, korv, pommes, milkshakes, läsk, alkohol (shots, öl) samt cigg utan filter...viktigt, utan filter.  Burgarna kan staplas i allt från ett till åtta lager, har för mig att fler lager gick att köpa till om du nu skulle vara så hungrig. Enlagersburgare är tillåtna att dela för sällskap som endast vill smaka, två och högre skapelser är INTE tillåtna att dela. Lyckas du sänka fyra lager eller fler skjutsas du till entrén i rullstol efter besöket. Misslyckas du äta din beställda burgare väntar smisk av sjuksköterskan, en särskild smiskställning finns uppställd i mitten av restaurangen. Vägar du över 350 pounds (~159kg) äter du gratis :)  Samtliga i ställskapet beställde in en Single Bypass Burger med en vanlig Fries och en Chili Cheese Flatliner Fries att dela på. Till detta tog vi cola. Bröden var luftiga och goda även om de kändes överdimensionerade för ett lager kött, ost och bacon. Det märks att de är tänkta hålla betydligt högre kreationer på plats. Köttet var saftigt, baconet salt och gott, osten var svårbedömd. Amerikaner är ostälskare men oftast gäller kvantitet före kvalitet. Pommes blev en blöt röra under chili/ost-såsen. Givetvis blev vi proppmätta, och detta på en singelburgare! Med facit i hand skulle vi skippat pommes och satsat på sänka en två- eller trelagersburgare.  Gå hit om... ...du vill ha en upplevelse utöver det normala. ...du verkligen är ute efter upplevelsen i första hand, och inte maten. ...du vill sätta tänderna i en hamburgare á 10000 kalorier. ...du har kört ett grymt träningspass innan vill säkra kalorierna. ...du av någon anledning vill pissa på George Bush och/eller Barrack Obama på herrarnas toalett.  Gå inte hit om... ...du förväntar dig ett seriöst restaurangbesök. ...du ska snacka jämställdhet med ditt sällskap. ...du inte är beredd på att få smisk i fall att du skulle lämna mat. ...du har sjukhusskräck. En i sällskapet blev väldigt dålig och fick lämna restaurangen!"}

The, nurses, were all adorable and very personable. We were all offered to sing karaoke, and might have if the list had more to choose from. The karaoke song list was short but did have fun energetic songs that everyone would probably know. Would I take my grandkids? Sure! It's a one of a kind time! The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because even though it's called the Heart Attack Grill, it would be super cool if they had at least one or two healthy options only because some of us really just can't eat like that.

For a place that claims to be a taste worth dying for, shouldn't the burger actually taste at least mediocre? The burger was overwhelmed by the chili, which is good but salty. The fries are crispy but flavorless otherwise. The milkshakes are thick and come with a slat of butter, but the only noticeable difference is that it's very smooth but feels like you're sipping room temperature butter with flavoring.  Frying something in lard doesn't automatically make it taste good. Honestly, it feels like a waste of calories and money coming here--Red Robin, Shake Shack, etc all have better food and prices."}

Management/ownership clearly terrorizes their waitstaff.  When a member of our party walked in with a coffee the hostess was noticeably fearful for her job and quickly had him throw it away.  I understand not bringing in outside food, and we're fine with throwing it away, but that woman was clearly worried she'd be reprimanded for him walking in with it.  She had the same fear when a member of our party took a gown off the rack to put it on and added that she'll get in trouble if her manager sees.  That's insane.

There's a bypass burger in a few different sizes and fries that's fried in lard. That's pretty much the only options, which is a bummer. I also notice they had mayonnaise sitting out and was wondering if they had refrigerate it over the nights. I didn't bother to touch the mayo(being cautious) and already acknowledging that their food is already very unhealthy.

Problem is the food itself is exceptionally mediocre. My burger was super dry, which is sort of unbelievable with how fatty everything was.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Brought my mother here for Mother's Day after we did a Fremont Street Experience walking tour (I gave her a list of places she could choose from but we were both curious about this place).  I had heard of this place for years but neither of us had ever been here before.   When we arrived, we were brought into a changing room where the nursing attendant assisted us with putting hospital gowns on over our clothes.  Then our nurse waitress brought us to our table.  All of the wait staff is dressed like nurses- the girls are in revealing nurse uniforms.  The decor is very busy- lots of pictures all over the walls, and there are TV screens lining the tops of the walls.  They have altered a bunch of movie posters to fit their theme, which is unhealthy living and eat-to-die eating.  Some of the posters were clever.  However, be aware- the theme is very sexual (which kind of fits in with Fremont's more adult atmosphere), and there were several pictures that I was actually a little embarrassed I was responsible for my mother seeing.    We ordered a chocolate butterfat shake to share- it arrived with an actual slice of butter floating in it.  We also got a thing of fries to share- not sure what they fried them in, lard seems right.  Then, my mom didn't want chili and I'm allergic to onions, so we each got a single hamburger.  I added the optional bacon (comes in increments of 5- I got the minimum).  I can't even imagine how people can eat the octuple burger with 40 pieces of bacon without being sick the rest of the day.    So, all of the food tasted pretty good at first.  My mom said several times that she thinks it might have been the best shake she's ever had, but by the time we had finished 3/4 of it, neither of us wanted any more- you could taste the fat.  The fries were really good, but again by the time we had finished about half of them, they weren't tasting so good anymore.  I really, really wish I had forgone the chili (she had already forgone the onion) and we had shared a hamburger- first because I had an upset stomach most of the night and it was pretty obvious that it was the chili, second because each hamburger was approximately 2,000 calories according to the guy, and third because although the first few bites were really good (hamburger bun was really good bread), we had both lost interest for the last 1/4 of our burgers- taste doesn't justify the calorie count.    The only reason we finished the $30 food (1 fries, 1 shake, 2 single patty hamburgers- none of which tasted good enough to want to finish and a $2 bottle of water because they don't allow you to bring in your own beverages and don't let you have tap water) was the threat of being paddled by the nurses at the end if we didn't eat it all.  There was no way I was going to let my mother be paddled- we witnessed several people being hit, always men, and some of them had tears in their eyes when it was over.  One gruff-looking guy actually jumped and pulled away.  They were all trying to be good sports, but none of them looked happy afterwards.   Their CASH-ONLY policy was an unpleasant surprise- I was lucky I hadn't emptied my purse recently but I barely had enough to cover the bill on me (I'm a card girl).    I was also not pleased by their water policy- we had been on a walking tour so we both had water bottles with us- they forced us to put the water bottles away and not drink from them.  Then they charged us $2 for a small bottle of water because they won't give you tap water.    I've wanted to try this place out for years, and now I can cross it off my list.  It was an interesting experience, but I won't be going back."}

When you first go in, they put you in a scrub and it's mandatory. It was a little annoying because I had layers on because it was like 40 degrees outside and adding the scrub on top of my clothes was going to be restricting when I eat. I didn't even want to take my jacket off because I'd still be freezing. Plus it's a little annoying in general because it's so tedious and all you really wanna do is eat.   Let me remind you that this is a themed restaurant. A medical/ hospital themed where the employees have a nurse uniform and a doctor uniform. And the setting of the place was new and interesting which is why gave it 2 stars. This place is more of an experience than it's food.   Now the food.. The food was bland. Bland. Bland. It was not that great. I've had better burgers than that. The onion rings were the only flavorful thing they had. Though I did like their mango dreamsicle. They are pretty strict with their menu but the way it was setup was cool. You can't have this, you can't have that, we don't have this, we don't have that. Like my aunt asked for hot water because it helps with her stomach and our server was like, Nope! We have this water bottle. I don't really know. I felt like our server was kinda rude anyways. I feel like the people work there think there think they're hot shit but I mean whatever I guess. Oh yeah. If you don't finish your food, you get spanked.  Overall experience was okay. Ambiance was the only thing that gave this rating 2 stars. Like I said, food was bland. Workers were kinda annoying. And it's cash only. I felt like they did too much with this concept. It's not as great as it seems to be. I personally wouldn't want to eat here again unless I have people out of town coming here that wants to try it."}

When we saw it in old Vegas, we knew we had to try it. One of the sexy nurses who was featured on the tv show was actually working while we were in!   It's a fun experience. First you're weighed in. If you're over 350 pounds, you eat for free! While we were there, we saw a super tall guy win a meal!  They have a giant scale outside the restaurant and one inside as well.   When you check-in they dress you in hospital gowns. There are sexy nurses and doctors as the wait staff.   The menu is extremely limited. It's just bacon cheese burgers, ordered by single, double, triple or the quadruple bypass. We got the standard which is the double.  We also got fries and shared a shake.   I absolutely love salty food, but the fries were insanely salted. I ate some, but I couldn't finish them, and that's saying something. The shake was rich and creamy, but it comes with a pad of butter on top! Crazy. You can even get your shake boozy with alcohol in it.   The food wasn't remarkable, but it wasn't bad. I wouldn't come here again, but it was definitely fun to try.  If you don't finish your food, the sexy nurse will come and whip you with a leather belt (I think you can decline, but it is offered as part of the service). I think it's also offered as part of their birthday service. If you're too full, they'll wheel you out in an wheelchair!   This is definitely an experience. I'm glad we tried it."}

You're REQUIRED to wear a patient smock while you eat or be thrown out.  You cannot even order a glass of water; they won't serve it to you.  Isn't that funny?  Because it won't make you fat!

After getting our gowns on we were sat and looked over the menu. Everything was a bit more pricey than your average burger joint, but obviously you are in a tourist area, and everything is a bit more here.  The cheeseburger was good, but not the best ever.  The fries we didn't really care for.  The theme and decor were fun and kitchy, and you can tell they gear what they do to the tourist, one-time patron, crowd. I doubt locals frequent this place.

With the variety of burgers consisting of how many stories high would you like your burger, and would you like bacon, this place screams ALL AMERICAN BURGER JOINT.

Now, you're probably thinking to yourself Scotty, c'mon mate, what is there not to love about a nurse spanking you?...

First thing you should know is that they only take cash so prepare for that. You can use there ATM but like all ATMs in Vegas they charge you like $7 to take money out. Second thing is you should finish your burger if you don't want a spanking. They told me after I ordered mine and after seeing them hit some guy I was determined not to be him. I also seen a guy get a spanking for not ordering alcohol so drink up. It's a fun place to go honestly. It seems to appeal to masochistic individuals for an example there's a picture above the urinal in the men's bathroom with two woman laughing talking about how small my Johnson was lol.

You need to be really open minded coming here.  Stepped on the large scale outside and I first weighed in at 105 lbs.  walking in I could not figure out how to enter.  I attempted to walk in through the turnstyle and failed.  Finally a nurse came and dressed me in a hospital gown.  I totally felt uncomfortable because all I could think about was being in a hospital where there are germs and sickness.  (It was a Psychological discomfort). And all of a sudden we saw people getting spanked by a midget who rides around in a mini ambulance to deliver food. It looked like it was so hard and painful!!  So as we were looking at the menu we read all these rules.  I was definitely not going to submit myself to such nonsense. I have absolutely no ass to save my life!  And it was a turn off that we would get punished for not finishing our food.  Skinny bitch was def in the wrong place.  We shared a burger and I ordered a butter fat shake.  I LOVE butter and all unhealthy delicious food, this got me excited and it tasted so yumm. But I could barely drink much it was extremely rich. The way they personalize and serve shots in a prescription bottle is really cool.  What grossed me out is that I bit into a part in my burger that was cold and hard that I could not chew. It was a large enough chunk. It was definitely the insides of a cow that I probably would not want to eat.  I made it out without punishment.  I wanted to try the wine that they serve in an IV but I was much too full. Upon leaving I weighed in at 107lbs. Can't be?  2 lbs?!"}

After being rude to one of the lovely waitresses and refusing to wear the awesome patients gown we got to experience probably the greatest tongue lashing I've ever witnessed. Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.    p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.  Everyone I ever speak to that is heading to vegas will hear my tale of how my hero Dr. Jon vanquished the snotty Euro film crew sent here to mock our American right to do whatever the f%#ck we want to. I will eat here every time I visit Vegas until I die.   Just revisited this American gem and it was every bit as good as the last time.

She had a bit of an attitude when we said we wanted to look over the menu as we had never been there before. Pretty much nothing aside from hot dogs and burgers for main entrees. I ended up getting a burger which was just as average as any burger anywhere else. The other major peeve was that all the beverages came in bottles which means no refills for anything. I don't think I have ever sipped a Coke so sparingly.

If you don't finish your food your nurse will then give you three good hard spankings lol! I would say this is definitely worth the trip to downtown. If you're looking for a good laugh and are willing to cheat on your healthy diet, come here!"}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "The Heart Attack Grill.  A fantasy of scantily clad nurses and greasy burgers!  Oh this could be soooo great.  It positively makes me cry that it just missed greatness.  Let me explain.  First off, the place requires sexy nurses.  Well...  they had uniforms... but honestly I think you will do better at most of the casino brew pubs.  The girls are cute... but seem more like the crew I would expect at In N Out Burger.  I know....  I know... this has nothing to do with food..  but hey...  I didn't invent the place.  I am just going by the image they project.  And this demanded to be rated.  Ok.. so the food.  Burgers are good, tasty, and slightly overcooked.  The fries....  well..  not worth it.  But I have to say I love the simple menu.  If you are in the mood for a refreshing Iced Tea or a Diet Coke... head someplace else.  It's sugary beverages, liquor, or milkshakes.  OK.  I'm in!  :)  The shakes are the thickest fattest shakes I have ever seen.  There is actually a piece of butter on top.  Ya.. well...  look at the name of the place.  Overall...  a fun menu.  Burgers, shakes, cokes, and a guy getting spanked by teenage waitresses in nurse uniforms.  Overall, not a bad lunch.  It's really not about food quality here.  This place is supposed to be an ultimate male indulgence.  Sexy it up a bit and figure out a way to take credit cards.... and I would add another star.  Make it adults only and we'll talk.  Oh ya... if you are over 350lbs you eat for free.  Umm..."}

I am vegetarian, usually I can go to any restaurant and modify things to fit my dietary needs, however, this is NOT VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY, unless you just want to eat a bun.  I thought I could get away with just having fries but then realized the menu noted everything is cooked in lard which was enough to scare my hunger away.  My son, had a double and an order of fries. He really liked it and it truly was a massive burger.  The whole idea of heart attack grill is fun and I'm glad I went, but I left starving!  Definitely check it out if you're in that area but beware if you are vegetarian."}

I thought the owner had a hilarious yet disturbing view on food and fat America so I decided to investigate myself.   You walk in and are greeted by cheesy nurses and made to put on a gown.. Fine I will play along. After seated I was greeted by a friendly sexy nurse, she explained menu. The menu is basically a chili dog, chili fries, or a burger with as many bacon slices or beef patties as you want.  My stomach turned as I ordered a cheese burger, I could smell the lard thick in the air. My date ordered a shake and a orangesicle freeze, I tried a sip of each, yikes they were so thick and rich they tasted like pure whipping cream with massive amounts of sugar, not palatable. I choked down bite by bite of my greasy disgusting burger. I had a front row view of the paddle station, person after person was marched up there by a sadistic asian woman dressed as a nurse. She winded up and swung with all her might, she inflicted as much damage as she could with each swing. (keep the bull whip away from this one) The burger was massive, & greasy, so very very greasy. Thank god I brought someone to help me finish or I would have been paddled myself.  I was most disappointed that I did not get to meet the Dr, I arrived too late. I can't rate the place any higher because well... its totally disgusting. Heart Attack grill is a fun theme and makes a mockery of American Obesity. My day was made when got to see a huge guy weigh himself on the livestock scale, as everyone cheered while the sirens rang for his 350+ body.   My stomach hurt the entire car ride home & I vomited in true Roman fashion as soon as I entered my restroom.   Thanks Heart Attack Grill! :D"}

Everything on the menu is so fattening and over at least 1500 calories, If your over 350 lbs you will get a free burger (they weigh you to validate your claims)  so if your on a diet or your easily offended by spankings (If you don't finish all your food) Or sexy nurses then this is not the place for you.  I had a double burger  with fries and it was over 3000 calories!  It was delicious. The patties were huge and so juicy with all that melted cheese good God! with a coke on the side I was in food Heaven. God Bless the food God! I also tried there Slushies' with 3 shots of vodka which came in a really cute pill bottle that you get to keep for a souvenir. Glad I can say I tried this place.

Fries cooked in PURE LARD and salted to perfection (they aren't crispy fries so don't expect them to be).  Unfortunately I was just passing through Vegas and I made it a point to stop here.  So I had to drive and had to skip out on the Jello Shot.  It's equivalent to like 5 traditional jello shots, it's half vodka, and it comes in a huge syringe (which you get to keep).

Each patty is half a pound, so you know what that means with regard to the quadruple-bypass burger. (I had a double-bypass).  Unfortunately, like a lot of burger joints, including In&Out, the fries aren't as good as the burgers. They need to be double-fried so they're crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside.  Low-end beer and wine (Fat Bastard, how appropriate).  Having to wear a hospital gown will get tired after awhile for locals, but tourists will eat it up and take many photos to email home.  Two amusing things happened while I was there: 1. My friend asked for water, and was told they don't serve water because it has no calories. 2. A guy got on the scale in the middle of the restaurant, and tipped out at 477 pounds: he was wildly applauded, and of course ate for free.  Not the best burger in town (that title now belongs to The Barrymore), but it's better than the fast-food joints, and more fun than Smashburger, so it's worth a visit....at least once."}

I'm personally not crazy about this place but if your really hungry and want to get full with a heavy burger, while looking at some sexy ladies then this is exactly the place. I would go as far as to say its a little above average hooters just with slightly better food. I only got a single patty which was kind of pricy but I can see how you can save a little cash after adding more patties or bacon, because its only like a buck to keep stacking the burger. I did like the fact that they don't use small patties or buns. It was a good burger but nothing I couldn't just get at Red Robbins.  The day I went we got good service so no complaints there. The nurse we had frequently checked up on us to see how we were doing and if we needed any condiments. It is true about the spanking and how hard they hit. I didn't receive it myself but you can tell they are not trying to kill you, but they put effort into it. There was something I didn't really care for and that was the décor. The place tries to be different and hospital themed but it comes off lame and just feels bleh. I think that needs to be changed. One other problem was that they only accept cash, I figure they would be established enough to be able to take card, but I guess not. Didn't have a bad experience but this place is more a 3.5 if I disregarded the cons."}

They make an emphasis on making your visit stand out, on top of the burgers that will probably result in a coronary, haha.  First step is to see if you qualify for your free meal by getting on the scale out front and weighing in at 350 lbs.  If you don't make that prerequisite, then you will be part of the paying pool so get your wallets ready.  The minute you step through, one will be required to wear a hospital gown and if you do not finish your burger, you will be spanked with a paddle.  I'm not talking about a plastic ping pong paddle.....this is a wood paddle so for all of you into spanking, this is the place for you.  The main course of this spot are the burgers and they range anywhere from one patty all the way up to ten or more.  You can then choose to load them up even more with cheese and bacon.  The only sides are french fries or onion rings, both deep fried in lard for that extra savory touch.  When I asked for a diet soda, our waitress (who was a doll, btw) gave me the, Honey, there is nothing diet here.  Milkshakes here have the highest fat content, hahaha.  They also have a 1 lb hot dog on the menu. Don't forget about the jello shots that come in a syringe.  I only purchased the one patty burger with 5 slices of bacon just to avoid the paddling in the event I could not finish my burger or french fries, but since my friend wanted the attention, I asked the waitress to spank him just for the hell of it, to which she obliged HAHAH!

Apparently if the scale states you weigh over 350lbs, a bell will ring and your meal is on the house.  As you walk in, you are greeted by nurses.  They give you an ID bracelet and fit you in a hospital gown.  The menu was simple by offering four different type of burgers (single, double, triple, or quadruple patties), fries, and drinks (water, coke, or shake.)  Everyone at my table decided to go simple and order he single bypass burger while one brave soul attempted the quadruple bypass.  I felt like the burger was one of the most tasteless burgers I have ever tried.  The fries wasn't good either because they were hard and not seasoned well.  There is also a catch about ordering the quadruple bypass burger: if you attempt this challenge and fail, a nurse will come over and punish you (get spanked in the ass with a paddle three times as hard as they like).  I feel like the guys wouldn't take that as a punishment.  LoL.  But my friend forced himself to finish the burger and ended up with food coma at the end of the day.    All in all, it was a good experience to see what downtown Vegas offered but I wouldn't recommend or return back to this place.

I spit the first bite of my burger out because it was so gross, then I took the bun off and there was a short light hair in the chili. I told the waitress (Her name was Courtney) and she took it. I then told her I just wanted some chili fries instead and she informed me that they wouldn't be free. Well yeah, I know that, I didn't really expect them to be. I told her that's fine but to make sure we don't pay for the burger. That is when she went from being overly nice (so fake) to a complete bitch. She said  Well of course you do... I mean its not our fault there was a hair in it. Yes, it is. It's exactly your fault. I told her I wasn't paying for a burger with hair in it and she argued with us for a while, then she took the burger to the bar and all the employees came out and loudly picked at it and tried to find the hair. They must have found it because she decided not to charge for the overpriced burger. The service and food was disgusting. I was scared to even eat my chili fries because they seemed like the type of people to spit in your food if you piss them off. It was gross anyway though and I ended up leaving most of it. I honestly can not believe this place is still in business.... You can only pay with cash. And there's only two non-alcoholic drink options... a glass bottle of coke and bottled water. You can't even get a glass of ice water. The website made this look like a lot of fun but the nasty food and terrible service ruin it.

As far as food, it was mediocre. There aren't really too many options due to the nature of the restaurant. If you generally enjoy milkshakes, I'd be very cautious about trying the one at Heart Attack Grill. I do enjoy my milkshakes but the one here that I had a taste of was just way too thick - it tasted just like pudding. If thats your style, maybe you'd enjoy it but I'm glad it wasn't something that I ordered off the menu.  A cool item I saw on the menu was the wine (someone ordered it during the time we were dining there) - it is served in an IV bag on a pole.

And read the article to get just a taste of Jon Basso's charming personality. ###  Clearly we understood the theme when we went there.  The implication is that you'd eat the extra fat because it was actually good (tasting, not for you).  I'm up for that.  Sure, it's offensive, but all in good humor, right?  The reality is that the burgers are weirdly pre-cooked and charred.  They're absolutely terrible.  The waitstaff acts like they've been whacked upside the head with a cast-iron frying pan before their shift.  They all live in fear of the owner-- the worst kind of low-life entrepreneur who seems to view the customer and public as his enemy and the police as his personal enforcers (see the other reviews for examples).  The whole coronary artery disease gimmick-- and yes, that's the whole joke-- is not optional.  You play along or get kicked out of the restaurant.    So, you have really crappy food, and anyone who says otherwise is either hired by them or has never had a decent meal in their lives, in the least funny theme restaurant (for crissakes, their spokesman DIED of a heart attack at 29) ever created.  For the life of me, I can't see what's even slightly enticing about it other than its prominent location at the end of Fremont."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Like some other reviewers I heard about this place and was curious but was overall disappointed and I will not be a return customer. My boyfriend and I each ordered a single, fries and a Butterfat chocolate shake.   The shake was good...for the first few bites then it was just too rich, I was only able to drink about 1/4 of it (and the bat of butter that comes on top grossed both of us out, we both scooped it out and put it out napkins). I would recommend splitting this menu item.  The burgers were ok; I really loved the buns and cheese but was really disappointed that the burgers are only cooked one way - WELL DONE! I usually enjoy my burgers rare-medium rare, so for me the burger tasted like charcoal. Disappointing from a burger place that only serves burgers that they cannot (or will not) cook them at different temperatures.  The french fries were appalling. We each took one bite of one and put the rest of it down. They were soggy and limp and didn't even look appetizing.  We also ordered a bottle of water for me and a bottle of Coke for him. I was surprised that they don't offer free water from the tap like every other restaurant. My boyfriend did enjoy his glass bottle of coke, loves that it was made with real sugar.  When the bill came ($33.00 for both us - quite pricey in my opinion) we were shocked that we couldn't use a Debit card and were forced to use the ATM in their lobby area. Granted, the ATM only charges $0.75 to use it, but our banks charge $3.00 to use other companies ATM machines.  Overpriced + mediocre food = non-returning customers.  I don't think this place will last longer than a year unless they make some changes."}

The wine IV was the whole reason I wanted to go and it was so worth it.  It is huge and only $16...I have never had more fun at a restaurant.  Fries were good, burgers good, I got the hot dog with chili or something on it and it was really good! All decent prices.  Our only turn off was that there was a group of nasty dude at a tabe adjacent to ours and it was uncomfortable to watch them with the waitress.  There were also wierd music videos playing that had been replaced with the waitresses and the (very creepy) owner of the restaurant.  It ended up being more of a sad visit because we just felt bad that our waitress (who was so awesome and friendly!!) had to put up with that.  You can still have the fun, uniqueness of this restaurant while holding some higher respect for your employees - hopefully there is a change!

I thought this place had a funny and creative concept until the day I actually walked inside; I have never in my life wanted to leave a restaurant more quickly.  Being brusquely demanded to wear a warm hospital gown and sat down in one of the only restaurants rude enough to not provide free tap water to paying customers is the last thing someone wishes to be greeted by during a Las Vegas heat wave. Furthermore you are given the ultimatum between forcing extra food down your throat or being publicly beaten if you don't quite feel up to finishing your meal in front of these people.  I didn't even need to try the food to know this would've been one of the most unpleasant eating experiences possible.  I simply left and believe 100% that I made a very wise decision. Judging from many of the reviews, the overpriced food is foul anyways, sacrificing flavor to add as many calories as possible. I am completely for the idea of frying food in lard, but only if it actually makes the food taste better...."}

She left, but shortly after that another Nurse came over and started reaching towards me as if she was going to try to put the gown back on me, and said you have to put the gown back on, per my manager. I told her she better not touch me and to send the manager over. At this point our group was so put off by the behavior of the 2 women, we decided to leave. Before going, my husband spoke to the manager and told her what had a happened. She apologized, but that didn't make up for the other two women who approached me initially & who acted like they were the hospital gown police and had no regard or didn't understand what a hot flash was.

The menu is really limited, mostly diner fare, massive burgers, fries etc. (don't expect any culinary fireworks). They have milkshakes served with a pat on butter on top, wine in an IV bag, and your medicinal liquor is administered in a pill vial. They don't serve any diet pop.  I ordered the candy cigarettes only because they are banned where I come from!  The decor is retro kitsch, complete with a large painting of a pin-up nurse riding a large cigarette. The other diners tend to be on the more rowdier side, especially if a guy is being paddled by a nurse. Don't see that everyday!    Sure it's a gimmicky place, but we had a great time. 'Murica!"}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "OH MY GOD, YELPERS!!  What is WRONG with you??  I had read about the Phoenix HAG years and years ago in a magazine and always thought it would be a fun place to visit... so when I stumbled upon their front door in Vegas this past weekend - I was beside myself.  It DOES exist and I am HERE!  I took a few pictures, ogled the menu, and went back to the hotel to convince my husband that we had to come back and eat the next day.  We did.  First of all - it is a THEMED restaurant.  If you don't want to play along, go somewhere else.  The waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses.  They were all cute, personable, and helpful with ordering and playing along with the theme.  I have a problem with some of the reviewers knocking their intelligence level.  If they forgot a drink, if they never came back to your table - fine, comment on service.  Don't call them stupid.  Enough of that rant.  As a diner,  you are required to wear a hospital gown.  Its part of the theme.  Again - if you are unhappy playing along, don't eat here.  Second - the food and drinks.  Don't want to eat a greasy burger loaded with cheese and lard fried french fries?  Maybe you should skip the place called Heart Attack Grill and go eat a salad at the place across the street?  Its a theme, people.  Go with it.  How can you possibly complain about the food at a place that has cigarettes, YES - cigarettes, on the menu?  I enjoyed my burger.  Very much so.  But I'm a protein hound and after tossing the bun and enjoying a fat wad of crispy and delicious bacon and a 1/2 lb burger patty with grilled onion - I was one happy customer.  Hubs enjoyed his burger as well.  If you're looking for a gourmet burger with a fancy cheese and special toppings with a homemade bun with your initials on it... don't eat here.  If you're looking for a fun place with good burgers that will fill you up, want to have a good time, laugh a lot, and try some good drinks... then tie on a hospital gown, because Heart Attack Grill is the place to be.  As for the drinks - I was VERY satisfied.  I had the Strawberry Shortcake slushie and loved it.  Very tasty, very potent.  And I will be coming back just to pick up a drink in a keepable to-go cup while I roam Fremont.  I passed on the milkshake - too rich for me... but butterfat won't kill you, people.  I won't get into a nutritional lecture on Yelp, but the sugar in that drink will do more harm to your body than the butter.  Or the animal fat that your fries were drenched in.  But I digress... for now.  Third - the atmosphere:  its fun!  That's what its supposed to be.  Kitschy, silly, and fun!  And I think this place totally succeeds with that.  Did I mention there are cigarettes on the menu?  Okay then.  Grab a group of friends, a camera, and enjoy an entertaining dinner at The Heart Attack Grill.  The guys (or brave enough girls) can hop on the scale for a before estimate and hop on AFTER all your drinks and dining for the after.  We even witnessed a guy who met the 350# requirement... the scale has a siren and a flashing red light to inform everyone within the vicinity that SOMEONE is eating for free!    Overall, just go in with a good attitude.  Know what you're getting into... and what you're going in for.  Try the slushies.  Get a burger.  Take pictures.  And have fun.  That's what its about.  And by the way.... this is the ONLY Heart Attack Grill in existence now.  It relocated out of Phoenix to Dallas... and then Dallas to Vegas.  So this is it.  Try it and enjoy!  And don't forget to bring cash... no credit cards here!"}

The concept of this place is pretty neat, as there are nurses that serve you and they have movies in parodies with nurses and doctors. The doctors are bartenders, they have nurses that sing, and dress you before you come in, in a patient gown. There is a rule here where you are supposed to finish all your food, or the nurse gets to spank you 3 times with a small paddle, and from looking at some that endured the slaps, they are soft pats on the ass haha.   They have beer, wine, hot dogs, shakes and burgers, I think wine or something comes in a syringe which is pretty cool. All their burgers are pretty standard, patty, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and you can take whatever you don't want out, and add 5 slices of bacon for an additional charge. The burgers also come normally with chili. Anyone over 350lbs gets to eat here for free, staff is nice and they have a decent selection of beers.

I'm guessing I saved myself several days worth of calories for not much taste. I ended up at Chicago Brewing Company at 4 Queens, which, while it's not as good as the original in Summerlin, still kicks the shit out of the Heart Attack place.  And really?

The burger(s) that we had were great, as advertised with plenty of well-done beef, lettuce, onions, tomato, cheese and a great hamburger bun.  My double and my buddy's triple were held together with long wooden skewers.  The french fries were also good, as advertised and came hot however they were limp, not crispy as I had anticipated.  The nurses that waited on us were all very enthusiastic, very attractive and helpful however it took some initial time for the orderly to take our order, and that was only after I flagged him down to tell him that we were ready to order.  His excuse was that he thought someone else had taken care of us however we had nothing in front of us other than the menu(s) that we had put down on the counter.  He  arrived with one chocolate milkshake and one Coke but we had both ordered milkshakes.  My buddy wanted vanilla, but we were told that only chocolate was available.  The music was loud but tolerable, rock with videos on the screens on the walls and the party atmosphere was noticeable.  I wonder where they obtained the mannequins that were dressed as nurses up behind the bar, as the well-endowed figures were the best I've ever seen.    Now, for the very negative, yes, the milkshakes come with a pat of butter, but of the two flavors offered, they had no vanilla available and the chocolate milkshake(s) were the WORST EVER, tasting, by both me and my buddy.  We could not consume more than ten percent of the milkshake in the clear plastic glasses in which the shakes arrived.  Worst tasting shakes ever. (did I already say that?)  I will go back, but I will not order the shake(s).  I should have accepted the Coke that was brought to me by mistake.  Next time I'll know.  Did I say the nurses were attractive and friendly?"}

I made sure to show the waitress/nurse that we didn't eat the food so we could get the spanking we deserved. They took it easy on us at us at first but then they got us good with the wooden paddle. The overall experience was awesome and worth the $ even though the food sucked."}

When entering there is a huge sign on the door stating cash only and you are reminded of this by the nurse who is positioned behind  a glass wall. She kindly reminds you that it is cash only and they have an ATM if you need it.  All patients must wear a hospital gown.  We were sat near the paddle station but sadly positioned so we really couldn't see what was really happening except the beatings. :) (You are beaten if you don't finish your food.  in reality, you have to buy one of their souvenir paddles.).   It took a bit for our waitress to come over to us to place our orders.  There really isn't much variety on the menu, it is a burger or a chili hot dog.  I got a single burger and my husband order the chili dog with fries.  The burger was bland even with chili on it and the fries were just soggy not crisp at all.  My husband's chili dog didn't have enough chili on it to cover the whole thing. Oh, and you can't just order a glass of water, you have to pay for bottled water and the Coca Cola bottles are the smaller kind.  Paying $3 a pop was not pleasant.   We were entertained while we ate as several tourists were being spanked but all in all the place is not worth a repeat.  Food was eh, service was eh, and the prices were eh."}

I came here with my family wanting to have a good time laughing and it ended up being the exact opposite. My family and I all ordered a burger and we got 2 basket of fries and chilly fries. The fries were unbearably salty.  We never complain so we washed down the fries with some drinks but the chili cheese fries ordered remained untouched after the initial bite because they were extremely salty. I told the waitress politely that the chilly fries were salty and she told me she could not take it off that we would still get charged for them unless we spoke to her manager. We were more than happy to talk to her manager. The manager Thalia came up to our table with attitude and annoyed about the complaint. Thalia was horrible, and extremely unprofessional I do not understand how a fun place like this can have such a rude and unprofessional manager. She told us that she couldn't take it off the order because the waitress would have to pay it from her own pocket. I then explained to her that it wasn't our fault or our waitress's fault that the chef may have put too much salt on the fries. I then questioned the integrity of her actions and reminded her that what she just said is against labor laws. She then started to hesitate and change her story and started to blame the owner and how they get in trouble. When I told her I was going to report this to the Better Business Bureau she started to get belligerent and cuss. Her words exactly I don't give a F**k, you can pay for the entire check. I will have security kick all your asses out of here. TBH this is the last and final time we are coming here. It's really a shame and now I know why this place has 3 stars. McDonald's has better customer service and I promise you no manager is going to come out cussing at their guests. It's really embarrassing that someone who's entitled the manager position would speak to a customer disrespectfully. It's even more disappointing that the company is committing ILLEGAL acts. After asking if I can have corporates number the waitress told me there is no corporate number and told me she can give me the owners number, she then went to go speak to the UNPROFESSIONAL RUDE manager Thalia who started laughing and mocking us. Thalia very loudly in front of the entire restaurant then yelled,  I don't give a shit they are paying for it, I already told them I will call security if they have a problem. The chili cheese fries were $6 freaking dollars lol!!! The money wasn't the point, it's her actions, customer service, and the manager's inability to handle herself like a civilized human being. The owner Jon Barrow should be embarrassed to have someone like her taking care of his restaurant and looking after his customers. The atmosphere and the idea is brilliant, if only the manager could get replaced because I don't think training could even fix Thalia. I am embarrassed and in complete shock. Do your self a favor do not come here, especially if you have kids. Unless you want your kids listening to a filthy mouth like Thalia's do not bring your kids here!!!"}

This was my second time visiting HAG, but first at this location. I posted lots of photos for you to view. Walk in and get your hospital gown on.  ****CAUTION**** There is nothing healthy here. You will not find any veggies, diet soda, or meat alternatives. It is an unhealthy place to eat and caters to that. For that reason, I didn't eat anything when I was here this time, but I did in the past and it was very flavorful. I've been watching my health and wasn't going to let Vegas take that and my money from me! However, it was important that I take my friends there because it is oh-so-fun!   If you're over 350 pounds you eat for free. You must get up on the stage, have all eyes on you as your nurse says something like attention... we have a challenge to eat for free then people 350+ get on the scale. If you're over the 350 you are treated like royalty... kinda neat... kinda morbid... kinda not cool... kinda cool! What do you think?  They are in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most caloric burger. They have doubled that since then but the first record stands so they haven't needed to reclaim their place. Get yourself an IV wine bag, a juicy burger, and a near butter thick shake! You better plan to either walk or sleep it off, cause you're gonna be sleepy!   Be sure to check out my many photos. Oh and make sure you eat all your food. Unless you want to be SPANKED!"}

I stepped on (only because no one there knows me) and was slightly disappointed, but whatever...  anyways... the hospital gowns are great in case you spill something.  We tried both the dog and the burger.  They were ok, nothing great unfortunately... BUT, the FRIES were AMAZING!!!  I haven't had fries that good in years.  I wish fast food restaurants still cooked with that fatty stuff, but now it's all healthy and fries just don't taste natural any longer... but these were terrific!  Our waitress was great as well.  Watching the spankings and hearing the Karaoke was super cool.  We'd go back with a group for sure.  The only reason I marked off 1 star was that the burger was dry and a bit overcooked.

If you are looking for a fun and bizarre place to go with friends and family, definitely go. If you are looking for a delicious burger, go to In-and-Out.

Just ignore them.  Trust me.  If you're easily offended and have jumped on the bandwagon for every attempt on social reengineering, then again...just go home.  You might want to steer clear of Dick's Last Resort in the Excalibur Casino, as well.  That place, and the Heart Attack Grill, are just wrong.

Expect a spanking if you don't finish your burger  With the exception of #1, it seems that there IS a heaven.  Oh well, can't have everything.  Day 1: Finished a triple bypass.  Day 2: Finished a single-bypass.  The single bypass was much better.  The triple-bypass was just too much, but I was able to finish.  That's the important thing.  The taste sort of diminished, fast.  The single-bypass, was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Both days, I had a Mexican coke.  Yes, they have this.  They also give you shots in a pill bottle, or in a syringe.  You can have the nurse administer your medicine, as I did.  Would I go again?  Hell yeah!  I might even buy my own hospital gown.  Sure beats the hell out of worrying about spilling on yourself."}

We walked in and we put the hospital gowns on and were told that if we didn't finish our food we would get spanked. This wasn't a surprise since we read up on the place before arriving.   Our waitress was extremely kind and she was a great hostess. The issue I have is with the security guard at the front. There was a guy that was extremely sick and his friends took him to the bathroom. My husband being a Nurse Practitioner saw the guys face, he looked pale and was sweating bullets. My husband followed the guys and his friends into the bathroom only for the security guard to come and say if the guy was throwing up that he would need to leave because the girls would not be cleaning it up. The guys friends told them that the guy just needed to eat but the guard told him they had to get him out of there!  My husband came back to the table and was upset that no one cared about the welfare of the customer. Had we not already placed our order we would have left. This is unacceptable! You should never treat another human like the way they allowed the security to treat that customer. The guy was not disturbing anyone and had my husband not went to check on him we would have not known what was going on.   What if something happened to that guy? That situation was not acceptable. I'm sure the guard will say the guy was drunk but once again he was not acting drunk and went to the restroom quietly. His friends weren't cutting up or being loud so there was no reason to kick them out. This is a liability and should not be allowed. My husband and I was really looking forward to this place but after that incident it made the remainder of our experience not worth raving about.   The burger was ok, not seasoned well and had it not been for the cheese it would not have been worth eating.   I do hope you all will do better when people are feeling ill, i would hate for something to happen and you all be responsible due to being irresponsible.

The fries were crispy and just perfectly salty. You cannot order diet coke since this is an unhealthy place but the coke comes in this really cute bottle.   There is also a huge scale outside that you can weigh yourself on going in and out of the restaurant. Also you cannot use a credit card bc if you do have a heart attack while eating then your bill will left unpaid haha.

The heart Attack Grille in AZ had a fry bar, kind of like a salad bar that they kept restocking thought-out our visit with freshly made fries, and it was all you could eat, also had a condiment bar with onions, tomatoes,  ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickles, Vegas has none of those. AZ had a good selection of beers and a tequila bar with probably 50 different tequilas, once again not in Vegas.  We visited the Vegas location the first week of November 2011 with some friends that had been to AZ after I had been there; they all agreed not the same place.  First off we should have known there was a problem when they would not allow us come inside with drinks that we had got out on Fremont Street, come on its Vegas and Fremont Street no less, we decided we give it a shot after we finished our drinks since we had all been the AZ location, we very disappointed to say the least. The burgers at the AZ location were juicy, I mean dripping juicy, you could not eat even a single without making a mess, also way more flavor.  Our waitress came by after we had our burger and ask how was it?, We asked her you want an honest answer, she said yes so we told we were disappointed and that we had all been the AZ location, she said the owner had closed the AZ location and opened this one. I researched more info regarding that, yes the AZ location is closed and the Vegas location may the first of a possible franchised deal.  If going eat at burger place that states how bad there food is for you and going take the plunge and risk life and limb to consumer an extremely high fat burger, bun smeared lard and grille I feel I you should be blown away by the experience, far from it.  Definitely not worth it much better burger available around town, we I go back probably not, I would rather going to the Chicago Brewing Company in Four Queens good food reasonably priced plus good beer, not Bud, Miller, Coors (BMC) We all agreed we would really be surprised if they survive a year."}

Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words 350 Pounds and Over Eat Free are definite eye catchers.  The Heart Attack Grill or HAG as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130212/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics  This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.  Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.  Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.  So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."}

As for the fries, it was alright. The one that surprised me most of all would have to be the butter milkshake.  It was better than what I expected it to be.  They do have an interesting theme. Waitresses are dressed up in nurse uniforms (not scrubs) and patrons are given hospital gowns to wear while eating at the restaurant. We actually took a picture with the owner who was dressed up as a doctor. My coworker recommended I try this place out and he mentioned that he got spanked for not eating all his food. We came when the restaurant just opened so the only people in there were a group of Japanese tourists who seem to be enjoying the place greatly. We didn't see any spanking or any of that sort because we ate all our food and we left before the group of tourists could. They also advertise that people who weigh over 350 lbs eat for free.

Pros:  -Funny theme  Cons: -Icky smell when you walk in. -Unless you get their smallest burger you can't split anything. -Shakes are unedible. Like they blended a stick of butter in every shake. (it actually comes with a pat of butter sitting right on top. We all agreed it was the worst shake we ever tasted.) -Cant order Diet Coke cause they don't do anything diet  -They REFUSE to serve their guests water (even if it's super hot out. Its VEGAS!!!) They say if you want water the closest thing they have is iced tea. I feel that this has nothing to do with the unhealthy theme of the restaurant it's just a scam so that you HAVE to pay for a drink. -Their food isn't even that good. -Cash only. -Their what you see is what you get attitude.

It is edible, so it's not BAD to say the least. You can get everything on the burger which comes with chili, tomato, onion, cheese, etc. Fries is a separate order, and the fries wasn't too good. It tasted like oil. Then again, they deep fry everything in lard so that's why. Unless you can finish anything that you eat, i recommend their single patty burger because if you don't finish your meal here, you will be SPANKED!! Yes, SPANKED! Not some wimpy spanking either, HARD spanking with a paddle...   If you've seen the restaurant on TV and want to visit it, then I would recommend it at least a once time visit. I wouldn't come back just because I want to come back. The only reason why i'd come is only when my friends or family members want to visit the place when we are in Vegas, but it's highly unlikely. Their drinks are strong, and they do give a decent amount for shots, but that's really it. Oh, the place is CASH only so make sure you bring CASH! They do have an ATM but you know, it's like a $5 charge!"}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Fighting Anorexia Since 2005.  Yeah, it's a themed restaurant that built its name on serving wildly unhealthy food.  You are required to wear a hospital gown (keep your clothes on thank you very much).  You will be served by well endowed nurses in all shapes and sizes but guaranteed to be curvaceous.  Don't finish, bend over and prepare to be paddled HARD (thought the board was gonna break with that whack).   Guys or ladies, it doesn't matter.  Punishment is dished out to both as the entire restaurant looks on, phones in hand.  On all the monitors, re-imagined hilarious karaoke vids of 80's classics.  Here's the catch, much of the food is natural and no more unhealthy than what you'd get in a fast food restaurant.  It just taste a lot better.   Burgers are very good.  Well cooked and seasoned ground beef with no additives, topped with a decent chili, fresh onions, tomatoes, and a slice of cheddar.  Fresh, soft potato bun able to hold it all together through the entire feasting.   All soda (Coke, 7up, or Dr. Pepper) are imported from Mexico and use 100% cane sugar. Milkshakes are made from all natural ingredients (including a pat of butter).  Want bacon, $0.92 for five strips on the single burger.  Burgers offered from one to eight patties (five to 40 strips of bacon).  Prices range from just over $10 - $30.  Outstanding fries and onion rings.  Both deep fried in lard for that extra crispy exterior.  Notes:  -- Sharing allowed only on the single. -- 1/2lb hotdog the only non burger item. -- If you weigh more than 350lbs, you eat free. -- Cash only. -- Vegan menu available (a pack of non filtered lucky strike cigarettes). * Three free spankings with yelp check-in.  Tip:  guys use the restroom.  There's something oddly satisfying about taking a leak on the face of... just go.   Don't knock it till you try it.  A great place to take any visitor to the wackiness that is Freemont Street."}

I was planning on ordering additional food/drink but after being told what I HAD to wear I immediately asked for the check. The hostess was apologetic saying she had to tell me to do so because the owner was there but I have no desire to dine at a place who decides what I will wear and gives their employees a mind set of having to ask for me to do something that even caused them embarassment. THUMBS DOWN! :(  Also, waitress takes your order on I PHONE. Thought she was texting the whole time I was ordering.  Previous reviews I COMPLETELY agree with:  Melissa G said: The fries made me want to vomit...they are cooked in lard. They only serve coke, water & alcohol.   Bypasses stop at the window and take photos of you eating...it was rather disturbing. YES! And they CHARGE you for water!  Jessica T. said: The tables have full rolls of paper towels, and bottles of ketchup, mayo, and mustard. YES, but dirty paper towel rolls with other persons goop on them from grabbing the roll and dirty condiment bottles complete with fingers prints of the previous diner due to the hamburger buns. EWW.   Virgil R. said: The burger was a very thin patty cooked way past well done and could have been used as a hockey puck. I like my burgers thick and juicy so this was highly disappointing; the bacon was left on the grill about 5 minutes too long as well and the burnt texture really distracted from the rest of the burger.

The hospital gown that you are forced to wear as a diner is actually quite practical, as it proved very effective in keeping me from making a mess on my clothes while eating.  The threatened outcome of a paddling for failing to finish your burger can indeed be realized here: during my meal, I got to see a tall (he looked to be about 6'-ish) grown-ass man get spanked by a nurse (i.e. waitress) for precisely that infraction. The punishment was comical for a number of (mostly obvious) reasons, but two in particular: 1) the nurse was approximately 4' tall, and 2) she *really* leaned into that shit - the 3 whacks were conspicuously loud from even the opposite end of the restaurant, and homeboy memorably jumped and rubbed his ass from the surprise of the unrestrained forcefulness of the first spanking.  As mentioned earlier, my burger and fries were not mind-blowing, but they did satisfy my hunger, and were not unreasonably priced for their large size. I was more impressed by the level of effort made by the owner/management in building the palpable atmosphere of cheekiness and political incorrectness in all aspects of the restaurant.  I can't say with certainty that I'd come back here a 2nd time (partly because the food is meh, and partly because I honestly *DON'T* want experience an actual heart attack). But, I *will* say that if you've never been here, you owe it to yourself to make at least one visit (for the novelty, if nothing else). Any restaurant that will itemize your sales tax as government theft on your receipt deserves at least one visit based on general principle alone."}

When we get to our table the menu was pretty cool looking. A bunch of hot babes, wrapped in bacon and laying on hotdogs which was out of the norm of course but cool looking. The menu mainly consist of Burgers Hotdogs chili, fries and shakes.  From looking at the pictures of the burgers on the menu they didn't look like they had any quality to them, so at the at moment I knew I wouldn't really like it. But my daughter was excited so I stayed. Ordered a double cheese burger and fries. So did my daughter. If i remember correctly they had a burger with like 6 patties on it, bacon and cheeses preeeety extreme.

Brainless, hot waitresses in scanty nurse get ups, food that is frighteningly high in fat and calories, marginal 80's music videos playing, customers wearing hospital smocks, shakes with butter on top, fat bastards getting free meals. Sounds like a cheese ball train wreck to me. But alas, I was talked into going here last night and have to say my prejudgment was wrong.   Let's start with the waitresses. As a Vegas resident, hot waitresses are all over the place, and do not entice me to eat somewhere. Don't get me wrong I love checking out hotness as much as the next guy. I just think it's usually kind of a cheap gimmick to get business. The gals here though are quite personable and some are pretty funny on how they present the whole concept of the unhealthiness of this place. They celebrate what they offer, with humor. So it does not come off as tacky sluts serving food...it comes off more smart, cute and personable. Service was fast and we were asked 2-3 times if we needed anything. They text their orders in too which is kind of cool.  The food. Man, some of this stuff sounds pretty disgusting. The onions are sautéed in pig lard. The fries are fresh cut and fried in lard. Both are full of rich flavor. If you demand crisp fries, it ain't happening here....but they are delish. The buns are fresh and come from a local bakery. The meat is 19% fat and comes from locally owned Larry's Meat Market. I like the fact that they incorporate local businesses in their business model. I had a chance to speak with the owner, Dr. John, that's where I'm getting this info, the guy is a marketing genius IMO. The burgers are certainly better than most places too.  I like malts and shakes...usually a nice chocolate malt over a shake. We were served a sample of the chocolate shake (sans the pat of butter on top) and I have to say it was one of the best chocolate shakes I have EVER had...seriously. Rich and VERY chocolately.  What I thought would be silly, tourist trap, douche city turned out to be a fun, delicious surprise. Trust me, I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I did indeed like this place."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I've been waiting almost a year before my GF finally agreed to take me to the Heart attack grill; I'm so conflicted; I wanted this to be the best burger in Vegas but it's definitely not; it's actually pretty close to the bottom of that list. On the other hand if you want a dining experience you get your money's worth so that is where I'm conflicted;   First the food; everything is super greasy; cooked in lard/fat and there is no such thing as diet or healthy here; that would normally be music to my ears and as we were sat and handed our menus I could just see myself going crazy ordering one of the huge coronary burgers but I've been losing weight and didn't want that to stop so I stuck with the regular sized burger and I'm so glad I did;   The burger was a very thin patty cooked way past well done and could have been used as a hockey puck. I like my burgers thick and juicy so this was highly disappointing; the bacon was left on the grill about 5 minutes too long as well and the burnt texture really distracted from the rest of the burger.  My GF complained it was by far the worst burger she had ever eaten and I disagree with that but only because I've eaten some really bad burgers in my time; I do have to say this one is going on that bad list though! the condiments on the table (mayo kept at room temp is scary)  The Fries were super greasy to the point they were soft. I know it's the theme here but come on guys you have to go with what tastes good over what is the most unhealthy thing we can put on the menu and I was disappointed with both the burger and fries.  The milk shake or lard shake or the artery clogging concoction they are calling a milk/lard shake tasted the best but that had a lot to do  with the fact I spent the last 4 hours outside on Fremont Street watching a parade and the coolness of texture oozing down my throat, yes oozing as our meal lasted about 40 mins and the shake didn't melt much you can only guess how much lard they used to make the buttermilk shake;  out of everything this was the best but my suggestion is to pick the vanilla over the chocolate one as it was just too rich for a regular persons pallet;   The other thing we tried was a syringe full of a frozen shot/slushy; it wasn't bad either and I wish we had ordered more than one or that they had more than one flavor available at a time; I really think they would sell more of these things if your customers could each order a flavor and pass it along  to the other people at the table;   Ok, so now the experience.  The food is lacking in taste and quality so why is this place so crazy popular?  In a country as overweight and out of shape as the USA is; this place is popular Because if you weigh a certain amount you eat for free! Walking in you are greeted by nurses who force you to put a hospital gown on and walk you over to a table; yes the staff is on the OMG hot side so if you have a nurse fantasy this is a good place for you; and guys word of advice is your girlfriend asks if she could work there don't hesitate, just say yes with much enthusiasm as she is judging your answer and response time;  Oh and if you aren't able to finish your burger the wait staff will beat you with a wooden paddle; after what happened to me at another restaurant I was more than happy to point out that my GF didn't finish and that I would tip extra if there was a bruise; you would be surprised how eager they are to whip you like a dog; my GF got one spank for every bite she left so keep that in mind once ordering (yes, I finished mine and was saved)   The entire set up is a bizzaro world hospital; there are no healthy products, you get chastised for asking for a diet coke so don't bother trying.  There are great reproductions on the walls of classic pop culture icons and movies all with a burger/hospital twist so feel free to walk around and look/snap photos; you don't want to miss anything;  the entire event was fun and cheesy in a good sense;  if you have some big hearty eaters in your group they might enjoy trying to take down a double/triple coronary burger but all in all you can easily stand on the outside of the restaurant and peek through the shades/door to see everything of importance just take my word for it you will be sadly disappointed with the food as my GF and I were.    All in all our meal was expensive (we did buy a t-shirt) and I won't mention other restaurants by name but if you want a burger you can go elsewhere and get a great burger at a huge savings; I would only recommend coming here if you want to do a food challenge and or you have a nurse fetish/like to be whipped;    I still haven't figured out how I'm going to rate this restaurant; I want to say 1.5 star for the food and maybe a 3.5 for the ambiance/experience.

You can take a group shot at that point, and they're happy to oblige.  There is a pretty sweet bar with 6x2 rows of TVs against the wall, a long counter with stool seating parallel to that bar, and scattered tables.  If you're over 350lbs, you can step on the scale in middle of the room to confirm, and you can EAT FREE.  Kinda cool, and disgusting, yet funny.  (It's not all-you-can-eat, but, hey, it's a free meal).  My buddy was the one that led us here that day, and he was out to conquer the quadruple bypass (with 20 strips of bacon).  His girl and I were still hungover from the night before, and we opted to share a single bypass... no, I am not ashamed.  Let me just fast forward and say the fries were way too salty (pass on that), and the butterfat shake was overpoweringly rich (I would totally get it again if I had 3 others to share it with me, as dessert).  My buddy... actually, I should start using his name as he has joined the pantheon of champions, along with Gannicus, Crixus, and Spartacus...  Paul P!  It was a great start, and he had to break the burger down to smaller pieces.  I had warned him not to get the bacon, but he was ambitious.  With only 5 pebble-sized bites left, his girl began to say It's Ok Paul, you don't have to finish it...  I was furious, and slammed my hand down, NO!  I insisted he could take it down, slow and steady -- only 5 more bites!  With resolve, I encouraged him to ignore the naysayers and prove himself.  And slowly, but surely, he finished each bite.  I felt as Rafiki did, watching proudly at Simba ascend the throne!  ... well, he didn't finish the bacon, but that was ok.  If he did, he could have had one of the nurses bring out the wheelchair and wheel him out!  Anyway, it was fun.  Bring friends that will lend support should you, too decide to set upon this path toward greatness.  There are humorous paintings on the walls you can enjoy, while you catch your breath.  You can also have a good chuckle at the urinal -- I won't spoil it for you.  On your way out, you can also check your blood pressure with the automatic cuff they have ;)  Btw, I noticed a few separate people get paddled by a nurse... I think each was all celebrating their birthday.  It was in good fun to watch an elderly lady say ouch! That hurts!"}

I had the single bypass hamburger and fries. You can have up to a four patty burger(the quadruple bypass hamburger). They have a scale in the middle of the restaurant, if you weigh 350 lbs. or more you eat for free. The burger is pretty much average and the fries below average. The fries look burnt although don't taste like they are. Probably from being cooked in lard. The big plus of the Heart Attack Grill are the servers/nurses. They take your order and bs with you for a few minutes. This probably causes the slow process of receiving your food(Even at 10:00pm). A must-see for hamburger connoisseurs visiting Las Vegas."}

If all you have to sell is hamburger, you would think that they would get it right! Nope!!!  You can only order the burger done their way, dry and overcooked.  Did I already mention that cause thats all I tasted?    The only options on your burger is tomatoes or onions.  Thats it? If you want cheese and bacon, well that will cost you almost $2 for the bacon.   For the single bypass or one patty with cheese and bacon it will cost you over $9.00.    Also, they only serve bottled water.  If you want soda it is served in a glass bottle so they can charge you extra.  This place is all gimmick and no substance.  There are plenty of places in Vegas to see scantily clad women dressed as nurses and get a bad burger. I would never come back.    By the way, the Heart Attack Grill has mayo in a bottle on all the tables.  That is the only place that I have seen mayo stored at room temp in a burger joint.

There were like 18 patties(exaggerating a bit), cheese, and red onions galore. They just wanted me to get spanked. I love pain so I didn't care. I ate 6 of the patties. I could have finished it but wanted to give the guys the satisfaction.   My friends ordered smaller meals but begged for some punishment. You get broadcasted online for all to see.

It's smack right at the entrance on Freemont St experience and the storefront features a giant size weight scale. It is definitely a tourist trap but also entertaining. Just the décor of the restaurant is worth checking out.  We were greeted by a hostess dressed up as a kinky nurse. She then escorted us to a walk-in closet where we grabbed the mandatory hospital gowns. I encourage everybody to take a group pic wearing the gowns because its priceless :)  FYI, this is a cash only place but the hostess will give you heads up anyway before you sit down. The menu is straightforward. You simply choose your burger starting from a single, double, triple, quadruple all the way up to 8 patties, if you dare. If you don't finish your entire meal including sides, you get spanked in front of public. It may seem embarrassing but public humiliation is what this place is really known for. The burgers however, were just ordinary. Too dry for my taste and I think they were frozen. Nevertheless, it was a blast hanging out here. Besides the public spanking, they also have karaoke. Anyone can request a song and perform on stage wearing the hospital gown while the crowd cheers on. Its definitely quite a spectacle!  Burgers start around $9 for a Single Bypass Burger and can go up to $24 for the Octuple. You can add bacon or other toppings for extra $$. Fries are also extra. They also have delicious real fatty milkshakes and liquor. Try one of the monster shots."}

Save the hassle for yourself**  Outside and inside, you are fully warned that this is an offensive restaurant. That, is what drew my guest and I inside though. Something different than a typical restaurant. Kind of like an Ed Debevic's.  First, you can weigh yourself on a scale outside to see if you'll qualify for a free meal, or to simply see how much you weigh going into the restaurant! Next, after probably waiting in line for some time to get in, you have a hospital gown put on you. You know, to make sure that you don't spill or get grease on yourself! How courteous! Next, you see some instructional videos about how the restaurant operates and historically, how it was founded. You are rudely seated and explained the rules again that you MUST finish your food or you will be spanked by a paddle. Male, female, old, young, they will get you. Every fifteen minutes or so, in between their incredibly corny and hilarious music videos, comes a sing/dance-a-long. Which, you guessed it, you MUST participate in (within reason) or you will be spanked. It's to help settle some of the grease and massive amounts of food. You may get to see a person or two publicly weighed in front of the entire restaurant to see if they qualify or when others are forced to do karaoke in front of everyone.  All of it is for an incredible price, hilarious atmosphere, and some pretty good greasy food and milkshakes (or beer if you want). You get to take a picture in a wheelchair at the end and shoved out the door.  Again, if you get offended easily, don't waste your time. On the walls and windows, they give their PO Box number and phone number and email to send complaints to because simply, they don't care and for good reason. :)"}

The milkshake was probably the most unhealthy thing I've ever had. You can't drink it but thankfully they give you a spoon.

The bun was stale and hard. I could not swallow the bite I took. We asked for the check and I told our server that I would pay for the water and the shake (I ate 2 or 3 bites). However I hadn't been able to eat the hot dog so I took it off the bill. She said no, you have to pay. I asked to speak with the manager and this is when I got weird. The manager also demanded I pay. She stood no more than 10 inches from me saying she wasn't going to let me leave. I told her at least 10 times to back up. She yelled across the restaurant for someone to call security. Meanwhile another manager comes to stand very close to me. They were threatening me until I finally put the money down and ran crying from the restaurant. I stopped security and told them what happened. Security told us they held me there illegally and that they wouldn't have made me pay. At that point I thought, ok, I'll get my receipt and write an e-mail. As I entered the restaurant and employee met me at the door, raised her arms and hit me squarely on both shoulders.

Yes, I wanted to see what this place was all about, and of course I had to eat the food and see what everybody was saying about this place was true.    I was happy that I did give this place a try once but if I am looking for a great burger joint, this would not be on the top of my list of place to hit first.  When you arrive, you will sign a waiver that basically protect the company when you do have heart attack from eating here, once you have passed that you are greeted by either a sexy nurse and doctor (let me tell you the sexy nurse is worth the trip here), at that point you are given a hospital gown, this will save time when you are rushed in to emergency room.  At this point you are seated and asked if you wanted something to drink, I will have to say the doctor I had waiting on me, was very friendly and fast at taking the order (order are placed through an iTouch, which is cool).  One more thing you should know about this place, if you are over 300lbs you can have a free burger if you are over 300lbs, and yes they will weigh you at the restaurant.   The food was OK, the burgers come in different sizes from one patty all the way up to seven patties, which would make for a very big burger, I personally had a double and that was just a bit more that I wanted.  The burgers have salt and pepper, but nothing more on the patty, the standard burger filing (lettuce, tomato, pickle and onions).  The bacon and cheese is a must on any burger, next time I will have to make sure I order more bacon.  The they add a scoop of chill, if I had known this I would have done without the chill, as it tasted like it was from a can and not fresh at all, so I would recommend add more bacon and skip the chill.  Again, I do not see me coming back unless I bring somebody that would like to give it a try, but if you want to have an experience while dinning, this is a fun way to do it.  I will not give it five stars due to the food, but everything else will receive some stars including the fast service they have.  The employees do make this place fun and thank you to them."}

The lady tells us o well if you want to stay here and eat you have to keep the gown on, it's our #1 rule, no gown you can't stay... it was already embarrasing for my mom to disclose that info and this chick just went HAM about her keeping it on, and said if it was too hot with the gown on we had to leave (wtf) This place sucks and it's not even worth the experience, they put these nasty ass gowns on that have been on other patrons all day, and night and make you wear them the entire time you're there, and if you don't eat all your food they spank you with a paddle. If you're drunk enough or a frat boy under 20 i'd assume this place would be fun, we've passed the place many times and i thought the theme was cute but the service really was terrible."}

The employees seemed to be simply going through the motions and did not really appear that they wanted to be there.   As for the food, the burger was not only overpriced, but overcooked as well. I don't mind a burger that is well done, even though I prefer medium, but I did not expect to have a burger that was like shoe-leather. The bun was twice as big as the burger, so I tore half the bun from the burger and it fit the burger properly. The bacon was only half cooked, maybe to even out the overcooked burger? The onions were the only part of the burger that was properly done. the tomato was so small it seemed more like a cherry tomato than a burger size tomato. There was supposed to be cheese on the burger, but I had a difficult time finding it, a single small bite was all I got with cheese.  As for the fries, all I can say is there is nothing worse than cold, soggy fries with zero taste.   This is one local that won't be returning."}

Other than Hooters, not many theme restaurants survive on the gimmick alone.   The all-cash thing must be so that you won't cancel your credit card charge after you find the food disappointing.   As for rules: people don't want rules when they are going out and spending their hard-earned money for food.  Given the food, the location, and the history of the ownership, they won't make it to summer."}

We were just curious about this joint cause the concept is really interesting. The ambiance is the best part of our visit! They make you wear a hospital gown when coming in to simulate a hospital scenary. The cooks dressed up like doctors and the waitresses as nurses :) Our waitress/nurse is friendly and seems enjoying her job so thats a positive vibe. The place is full of 80's movie references, which is awesome :) The food is not bad either... I know veggie people and animal activies will get their pms flowing, but hey you gotta live to the fullest.. but in a balance way ;) Anyway... the food....  My girlfriend ordered a single bypass burger, which is a half pound burger. This one you can share and want to convinced my girl if we can share, but she said no; she instead made me order a double bypass burger with 10 bacons in it. Their burgers are juicy and greasy, which is delicious but mann it is a belly buster fosho. We ordered their Injection jello shots as well to soften the blow. Bruh that is quiet a meal!  Unfortunately, while my girl was laughing her butt out.. I got 3 spanking from our nurse because I did not finished my insanely huge burger. So I suggest order the menu that you can finish because you cannot to go the food either. Dammit!!! My butt cheeks have a red mark to remmember.. a real Vegas experience lol. Overall, I will definitely going back here again with other friends because it is fun :)  PS: Don't go here if you got health issues dummy!  PSS: Eat at your own risk!"}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "The heart attack grill is nothing more than a tourist attraction. A very poor tasting one at that. The burgers and fries have no real flavor. Burger patties lathered with lard and cooked on a flat top stove so the patties are dripping in pure fat. The fries also fried in pure lard have so much fat in them that they taste soggy. Soggy fat. Sounds delicious don't it? The owner makes light of a very serious addiction in this country. Food addiction is just as real and just as deadly as any other addiction. The owner let's people that weigh more than 350 pounds eat free. Why free? So their gluttony will eventually kill them. To this day 3 people have had a heart attack IN the restaurant. Among those 3 was his unofficial spokesman that ate at Heart Attack Grill for free every day and died. So go to Heart Attack Grill put on your dirty hospital gown, pay for an overpriced disgusting meal and enjoy what might possibly be..... your last meal."}

This place had all of the guilt for me and none of the pleasure.   The waitresses were hot in a Vegas Stripper sort of way and I get the gimmick, being given a hospital gown.    After the first joke though, it wore old. I wanted a water.  They don't serve it.  I don't really like sugary soda.  I should have seen if they had coffee. They do not take card, just cash.  They give out free food if you are over 350 lbs.  After awhile it felt less and less authentic until it felt like some cheap mockery of a diner experience where the joke was on me.   The meat is good. Have to say my cousin and I split one burger between us. I barely could eat a quarter of their smallest burger. The shakes are super rich but seriously - the butter on top made me loose my appetite for it.   Fries should be fried in something that has a taste - not lard. Lard is useless for cooking, it's not nearly as tasty as bacon fat or duck grease or  any number of oils out there.   I wouldn't go back. I would save my calories for something else."}

I decided to take a bite of each ingredient separately to see what the problem was.   The patty seemed like a very low grade soy-burger type thing that had close to no flavor what-so-ever.   Even the bacon didn't taste very baconey [sic]. The cheese tasted like I was biting into a glob of pure lard with a tiny bit of cheese flavoring added, it was really disgusting.  The fries were almost as bad as the burger.  The only thing I had that was good was the chocolate shake. It was unusual in that it had a buttery flavor. That might not sound good, but it is. If you must come here definitely get the shake.  This place is all theme and gimmick.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "First real food stop here in Vegas after being up nearly 24 hours. I am in Vegas for the Mr. Olympia expo and after seeing all the healthy fit people one of the people in our group wanted to eat at this fattening restaurant. I had never been here, but was very hungry after walking all day, and being off my diet for over 8 months. Great way to celebrate with this high calorie restaurant.   The first thing you notice in front of the restaurant is a scale...yes to weigh yourself. Apparently they promote being oversized, since all those over 350 lbs. eat free!! Our whole group weighed ourselves just to see how much we would weigh after eating here. Upon entering we were greeted by nurses and given a hospital patient gown. It was the best how very themed the restaurant was getting all customers into their world. This created a wonderful atmosphere for us to lose ourselves and enjoy the moment. They are known for the highest calorie burger with the quadruple bypass burger. It has 4 1/2lb. patties with cheese chili, onion tomato and pickles. Basically also everything is cooked in lard to raise the calories even more! The burger alone was 8000 calories. I added fries also cooked in lard, so who knows how much more calories that added! I also got a strawberry daiquiri that came with a personalized prescription bottle with your name printed on it. The bottle was 3.4 oz of a shot of alcohol. This was a heavy, high calorie meal that I ate completely but felt guilty and shame at the same time.   Everything tasted good, but it was all about the experience of the restaurant and how the theme of it enthralls you while eating there. If you don't manage to finish your burger, you will get spanked. Yes, spanked by one of the nurses with a wooden paddle. Very funny to see when it happened. I would come back here again, but only with friends. The reason why is to enjoy the experience. I didn't think the food was all that great, but still good.   I would recommend this place to all first timers and all those who love burgers. I'm really giving it 3 stars for the food, and the extra star for the theme given at the restaurant. Hope this helps you decide."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I understand the gimmick of this restaurant and also know to factor that into thinking about the experience and the food I'm going to have or had. The waitnurses, as I'd like to coin this term, are very friendly, save the one I accidentally caught scratching the middle pocket of her apron around the area near what some would call wonderland. Oh, of course she happened to be the one to serve us.   My brother, my love and I went in, were draped in their clean bib-acting robes. As we passed by a wheelchair for an obese person, I wondered to myself if anybody actually sat in that chair before and fit the chair. I was expecting a fun evening, especially for my brother, who just turned 21 and was in town for New Year's weekend.   Previously, I had stopped by once before to get their chocolate shake. The hostess ordered it for me, and curiosity got the best of me, so I had to ask how many calories the chocolate shake was. I was thinking maybe 1000 would be a little bit close to my expectation of unhealthy, but it was double that amount! 2000 whopping calories for what Ryan H. described as an East Coast frozen custard - I took it to go and shared it with my love and together,we were both able to have half of it. We couldn't do the rest. They advertise that it's pure creme. I don't mind killing myself for good food, but I would say this was a tad bit better than mediocre.   To the dinner... we had the  Triple Bypass: our waitnurse (the one who scratched her area) wouldn't let us split at first, and we told her that we had already eaten and were just passing by and wanted to try them, so she allowed us to split it ourselves. Grilled onions must have been on the sideline of the grill for a while, because they sure were out of practice and didn't do their part. They were lukewarm and had no flavor, not even anything savory. The bacon somewhat tried to attack us, but they needed more of a defense because again they were benching players. Bacon strips were also lukewarm. The meat was not a seasoned player, didn't know how to attack us and the sliced tomatoes were not signed on this season, so they were a no-go either. The only thing that attacked us horribly were the calories. The Quadruple Bypass is 8000 calories according to our waitnurse, and we had the Triple, so minus maybe 1500 calories brings us to about 6500 calories split between the three of us. Well, I didn't do bread, so it's a little more for the guys.   We also ordered 3 Cokes and the  Vanilla Shake: this was yummier than the chocolate shake, but it definitely did taste like butter, but not like a butter popcorn jelly belly as someone else mentioned in their review. I would like to add that for the amount of calories it had, it should taste great, but it wasn't really up to par with its 2000 average daily value calories. My brother really enjoyed the shake. I enjoyed it also, but perhaps because the burger was so disappointing. Le sigh...  As we were waiting for our fries to get to us, we saw a doctor-costumed bartender dancing with a waitnurse who was kind of DJing and counting the minutes to New Year's. They were having fun dancing, and yes, there were dim TVs if you were sitting right next to them, but if you were far enough away, you were able to see music videos from the 80's paired next to videos of a doctor using his stethoscope to pat the burger meat down onto the grill.   Lard-fried Fries: I had a total of about three fries from the basket of fries. No, I'm not obsessively counting calories and at this point it wouldn't even matter. However, I was very disappointed that the texture of the fries weren't identifiable. I could say what it wasn't. It wasn't crispy. It wasn't freshly soggy like In N' Out. It wasn't delicious or had a certain taste to it. It was the most apathetic basket of fries I had ever met. Hello, Fries. Okay. I see. Goodbye. You don't care? Okay.   Our waitnurse brought us the bill. Throughout the entire dinner, we figured out where she had her hand on our plates and the bill, so we weren't nervous about her being our waitress, not at all. I'd like to add to her benefit of the doubt, that all the waitnurses are made to wear red bras and undershorts that are possibly uncomfortable.   I asked my brother if he had fun. He enjoyed the experience, but he didn't like the food. I am a good food hunter. I feel I disappointed my brother and should have listened to the few and the wise on Yelp, but wanted to try it for myself, hoping to regain a few stars of hope for this new and grotesquely interesting place. Hope? Nope. I wish the Denny's had opened there instead. Sorry, Dr. Jon. Nutritionist gone wild? Well, this is ¡¡¡¡Mad Food Yelper gone fariggin' LOCA!!!! Okay. Time of death...2:41am"}

It's a novelty restaurant that just can't deliver on what's most important for a restaurant: good food.  First: the good. The entire premise of Heart Attack Grill is to be as politically incorrect as possible. There's a blood pressure machine with a high score list. People over 350 lbs eat free. They don't serve salad. In fact, you can't even get lettuce on your burger. There are TV's all over the restaurant that just show the press coverage of Heart Attack Grill (this gets old real quick - I'd rather have the football game on). The waitresses are wearing sexy nurse outfits. But after the initial chuckle, you actually have to eat.  The bad: The food. The only palatable part of our meal was the Mexican Coke. Usually grease=good, except at Heart Attack Grill. I'm not sure how they did it, but they made a burger that's both greasy and dry. It's like they overcooked some beef and bacon, slapped it on a bun, and then used a mister to spray flavorless oil all over the burger. I tried to make it work. I really tried. I asked if they had any hot sauce, but they said no, you just have your choice of ketchup, mustard, and mayo. The fries tasted like they were just left in the fryer at low temperature. They came out greasy, limp, and without any flavor at all.  If you want a burger, go to any of the established burger joints in town: Fatburger, Five Guys, In n Out.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "We had been really excited to try Heart Attack Grill ever since seeing it featured on some Travel Channel show in 2010 some time. So when we learned that Heart Attack Grill was opening in Vegas on Fremont street, it was ON!  Flash forward to this past weekend. We stayed in Las Vegas and decided to make a trip to Heart Attack Grill for Christmas Eve dinner. Not your typical dining choice for one of the most special nights of the year; then again, Vegas isn't exactly the first destination folks think of for the holiday, either. So... It was par for the course!  Our journey down Fremont Street was one of excitement and anticipation. We were finally on our way to bad food ground zero! When we arrived, we took pictures of the front of the restaurant, including he parked ambulance in the front; funny stuff so far.   Inside, we were greeted by a nurse who didn't even bother standing up from her seat behind the counter until we made it clear we wanted to eat. Weird.   The restaurant was very empty. A few families were there, but it felt very cold and odd. To give them the benefit of the doubt, it WAS Christmas Eve. However, the design and execution of the place just isn't welcoming or even amusing. It's bad. An empty bar and walls filled with huge monitors that were so dim, they'd have looked better turned off. '80s music played along with their music videos on one wall. I guess that means the '80s were the flashpoint of shitty, greasy food. Or not. Who knows? Or cares.   Our waitress was a nice gal, and we thanked her for working on Christmas Eve. However, a nice server doesn't make a crap restaurant much better than it is.   Food ordered included a Single Bypass with lard-fried fries and a bottle of Coke. Bottle of Coke = no refills, and The Heart Attack Grill does NOT serve water unless you want to BUY a bottle.   The fries we envisioned were golden and crispy, like McDonald's back in the day. Heaven, right? Wrong. They were limp and soggy, fried with their skins on. Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.   The burgers were OKAY. Nothing great. It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger. The cheese slices were sandwich slices, the crease from the individual plastic wrapper impression could still be seen. Classy.   Finally, the dessert of choice was a butter fat milkshake, vanilla, with an entire bar of butter blended into it for good measure. We shared and ate with spoons because the consistency is more like ice cream than a shake. And so... about half way, we decided that the taste of butter really overpowered the vanilla. That wasn't a good thing. When I finally put my finger on it and said, This tastes EXACTLY like a Buttered Popcorn Jelly  Belly, that signaled the end. Because that IS what they taste like. Gross. Not even sweet. Just gross.   The bill came to $30 for the two of us. Heart Attack Grill doesn't take cards, only cash. I thought the cheap-ass Asian places in Alhambra were the only ones that pulled that crap these days. But anyway.  We paid and walked out feeling like we'd been had. The waitress was fine and friendly, but the others (including a guy dressed like a doctor) walked around the place NOT interacting with guests, NOT making jokes or being lively. They just walked back and forth like zombies; the perfect environment to be wild, rude and crude. But no - total ambience fail.   I honestly don't think Heart Attack Grill will survive very long in Vegas. There are too many dining choices. Especially when there is NO feeling of experience of even humor when you eat at the Grill. Just zombies taking your order with iPhones and hurrying back to doing nothing (or in the case of the hostess, sitting on her ass).   What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us. To say we were let down is an understatement. I'd never recommend this place to anyone. The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant."}

One of the orders was the half pound hot dog, looked amazing but the hot dog was cool to the touch. No big deal just have it heated up a bit and its good to go right? We sent it back and the gutless manager in back tells the waitress to tell us that its hot enough and if we want a new one we have to buy a whole new hot dog... 9$ for a hot dog and you cant even serve it hot?? Wow and a real manager would come deal with a problem in person. Not send the employees to pass their rude messages. Poor excuse for management and even the waitress agreed that it was the worst management shes ever worked for. She also told the waitress that 70 was hot enough for a hotdog???  Are you kidding me?

When we went inside to dine, the place only had a few customers at tables. Hardly anyone at the bar. The WOW FACTOR that my wife and I received from the Fremont Street location was sorely missing.  About 4 or 5 years ago we went to the location on Fremont Street, the atmosphere and food were out of sight. We had a blast, just read my review here on YELP!  This trip was just not the same. I ordered a triple-bypass. A three patty bacon cheeseburger. It just wasn't the same. The location at Fremont Street, I ate a quadruple-bypass, a four patty bacon cheeseburger. I absolutely loved this. The triple-bypass was bland at best.  This location heavily advertised that if you don't finish your meal, you get a spanking. My wife didn't finish her meal, so she took the spanking. I also didn't finish my meal, I DIDN'T WANT TO FINISH MY MEAL!   I didn't get spanked either.

I don't know about you, but if a restaurant is EVER featured on a show like this for the same reasons that HAG was, it's pretty much dead to me. They can claim to have changed, but from what I see anytime I want past the place, it hasn't...  Beware!"}

I unfortunately was among the trapped and came here with a group of friends... I have literally nothing good to say about the food at all which is comparable to a large, messy chili-burger ordered from a snack bar at a Little League baseball game. The service was equally bland in all areas and the food took ages to arrive. The best part of my experience was realizing that I wouldn't ever have to come back to this gluttonous hive again."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "BEST craft cocktails EVER.  Seriously. Lots of people design creative craft cocktails, but then other people make them and they're way off balance. Or something else is wrong. We had six, and all were in the range of stellar to magnificent.  5++++ stars for those amazing cocktails. Great variety too. Some more boozy, some less, great variety of spirits and house-made elixirs.  Great service.  Food? Left a lot to be desired for me but my partner was more easily pleased.  We shared mac n cheese (my personal favorite and one of the better macs around), broccoli crunch, and roasted cauliflower. The cauliflower was a garlic cop-out. Like young people who don't understand flavor and cook only with garlic and salt. Only in this case it's garlic and lemon. Not interesting, not creative. The broccoli crunch had raisins (not on menu list) and lacked pepitas (on menu list). If it's going to flip from what's advertised they should tell you.  Surprise raisins are just not cool. Partner liked both of those dishes, but I'm the chef in the family, and I found them lacking. I think he liked the mac less because of the pasta but I thought the pasta was excellent--smaller elbows that didn't taste like boiled bread like some of the larger pastas can. Had a nice tang.  Overall this place warrants a visit, especially from those who eat meat. The heavy-on-meat menu had a lot of creative options. They really should add a vegetarian sandwich/slider option to the all-meat sandwich list.   My other complaint was being seated by a rear door that apparently leads to a patio (unused because freeeeeezing) and the offices, but employees constantly went out to the office for apparently no good reason and froze us out every single time they opened the door (about 30 times in 3 hours)."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "I cannot say enough about Carson Kitchen.  The food is awesome, the services is amazing, and what a fun environment!  We sat on stools facing the cooks, so we were able to watch all the prep.  The thing I was struck by the most was how well the staff gets along.  They seemed happy to be doing their jobs and the affection they had for one another was clearly evident.  The food is phenomenal.  We ordered the Chicken skins, asparagus salad, butter burger and pizza (ham and pineapple).  Everything was delicious.  The chicken skins are very popular, and although I like crispy skin, they were a bit much for me.  The idea of eating all that skin kind of got in my head a little,  but my husband loved them.  We had the bourbon brownie and bacon ice cream for dessert.  It was so rich and delicious.  I highly recommend Carson Kitchen.  We will make this a must stop during all our trips to Vegas!

There is on street parking, but be ready to put some money in the kiosk.  Nothing is free in Vegas anymore!)"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "A restaurant is judged not only by the food they put out but also by the service they provide. Tonight I was super excited to try out Carson Kitchen. I left unimpressed and actually a bit offended by the waiter's service.   Initially, the night started off alright. He introduced himself (I forgot his name) and was attentive enough. He gave us waters and recommended that we get about 2 plates/person as this restaurant mainly has small plates that are meant to be shared. We followed his advice and ordered 6 plates total. Halfway through the meal, the service started going downhill. We had 4 plates of food still on our table when he asked us if we were doing okay/if we wanted to order. 6 plates is a lot of food, so we said we were good and didn't order. He came back at least 2 more times while we were having our savory dishes to ask if we wanted to order more. That's a little overkill, especially considering that we already got his recommended amount of plates. When we wanted to order dessert, he was nowhere in sight, and we ended up having to wave at him from across the room. And then he tried pushing for us to try all three desserts. Dude, we're full. He also kept asking us if we wanted more than iced water. I think after the second time of telling him that we were okay with just water, he would get the hint. At the very end of the meal, he also gave us attitude when we asked if we could split the bill three ways. Honestly, he could have easily just told us no and been done with that. There are apps like Venmo; I can work around not being able to split a bill. Instead, he made the rest of the night super awkward as he hovered over us as we tipped him with the portable credit card machine.   We ordered: crispy chicken skins - one of the better dishes of the night. You can't go wrong with fried food, and the smoked honey is a nice accompaniment. bacon jam - They put a lottttttt of balsamic vinegar in this; it was a little too tangy for me. I would put more cheese to balance out the vinegar. It has also an odd texture and reminds me of diced up Asian beef jerky. black rice and oxtail risotto - They advised to mix the dish up thoroughly before eating. There was a familiar taste to it, but I couldn't place a finger on it. It was alright....  baked mac and cheese - They have a pretty sharp cheese in that blend of whatever cheeses they use. It's nice. They also browned the top with some breadcrumbs; the added crunch was a nice change in texture green, eggs, & ham - It smelled of smoky deliciousness. The eggs were overcooked so we couldn't spread the egg to the other pieces of flatbread, like we were advised. However, it also smelled exactly like the wild mushroom flatbread from the table next to us; so I'm going to assume that they taste also similar' glazed donut bread pudding - this was the star of the night. Get this.   Despite the chicken skins and the dessert, the service I experienced today makes it difficult to want to ever come back. 3 stars for food; -1 star for the awful awful service"}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This place came highly recommended by a friend of mine who was a Las Vegas hotel concierge. I was looking for a hip spot with an eclectic menu that included options for two friends with a dietary restriction (they are vegetarians). When I looked at the menu at Carson Kitchen, I thought this was the perfect spot with lots of meat centric options and a large variety of veggie options as well. They were able to accomodate our party of six and seated us inside (I called two weeks in advance). I never got to see their outdoors area but I would imagine the ambiance is more fun than inside.   The only reason why I am giving Carson Kitchen three stars is because some of the dishes didn't live up to our expectations. The wild mushroom flatbread was oversaturated with some kind of barbecue sauce which is not listed at all on the menu so it was a little shock to the palate. The black rice and oxtail risotto was not good at all. That was sadly a disappointing dish. The crispy chicken skins were just o.k. After hearing so much about them, it was displeasing to find them so bland.  Now that I got that out of the way, I have to mention that the service was amazing. Everyone from the host to the server were great. Our drinks were on par and we had some really delicious dishes; bbq burnt ends, devil's eggs, tempura green beans, pig in a duvet, baked mac and cheese, and rainbow cauliflower. The absolute star of the show was the rainbow cauliflower.  Carson Kitchen, you win at service, drinks, and cauliflower."}

But no harm done, we got drinks at the bar and took them into the garden/patio they have in the back. It was very pretty and we enjoyed ourselves. After an hour, they called us in for our table. Here is what we ordered:  1) Mushroom Flatbread - 5/5 yummy, generously topped 2) Broccoli salad - 3/5 cold salad with a sprinkling of sunflower and pumpkin seeds. It tastes okay. 3) Beet salad - 4/5 if you like beets this is a good one to have. It has mandarin oranges which provide a nice citrus flavor. 4) Macaroni and Cheese - 4/5 what is not to love about mac and cheese. I just took out 1 point for portion size. this is more of a side than a main. 5) Tater Tots - 5/5 6) Chicken Skins - 2/5 Personally did not like the way the chicken skins were seasoned. I guess the honey was supposed to be a nice touch but did nothing to add to flavor. 7) Bacon Jam - 5/5 Delicious!!  8) Burgers - 4/5 Try it with the Bacon Jam.  Service was terrific, Our server (I forgot his name) was really helpful with recommending dishes and pacing our meal. He was very knowledgeable and we found his insight valuable when navigating the menu.   Is this worth checking out? I would say so, especially if you are staying in Downtown, this is walking distance and very convenient."}

We were served:  Wok charred edamame Ancient grain Greek Blood orange and root Bacon jam with toasted baguette Wild mushroom flatbread Pear and bleu flatbread Hawaiian sliders Secret Sunday chicken sandwich Sprouts and spuds Steelhead trout Turducken pot pie Shepard's 3.14 Banoffee Pie  This was my third visit to Carson Kitchen and I was wowed by the creativity--the risk taking by the chefs with these dishes.  Some standouts for me:  since I hadn't had the bacon jam when it was on the menu before, this was a treat.  As a person who has only eaten Spam for the first time within the last year, I was pleasantly surprised by the Hawaiian slider with a round of Spam on the bottom, a ring of pineapple on top, and the whole thing topped with some seaweed slaw.  The Secret Sunday chicken sandwich is very large so this is definitely a share dish, too.  The chicken was as moist as could be and the and the spicy aioli topped it off nicely.  The last three savories all were amazing.  The Turducken pot pie with buttermilk crumble top was nice and creamy and the duck flavor came through the well crafted cream to the pot pie.  The Shepard's Pie 3.14 is a new take on the traditional pie.  Cubes of lamb, gnocchi, vegetables, and potato sticks.  Very creative and tasty with the rich broth.  I was completely blown away by the steelhead trout.  Although hard to say, this was the best savory of the day for me.  Cooked perfectly, the trout was moist and rich.    Finally, the Banoffee Pie with Bailey's whipped cream and biscotti, was a perfect way to end this lunch.  I'd had this before and was glad to see it come back to the menu.  Service was superb!  New share plates were always brought, the staff was extremely friendly, and Chef Harwell was there to introduce each of the dishes and expolain how and/or why it came about.  This is a gem of a dining spot not just for Downtown Las Vegas but from any place in the Valley.  Carson Kitchen rocks!"}

And the subsequent bites were just as flavorful and wonderful. These are a must order.     The third dish we got were the gyro tacos. And again, the flavor train came rolling through once more. I don't know who the conductor was, but the entire kitchen/wait staff do an exceptional job.

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Spring 2016 -  Now featuring the talents of Chef John Courtney for long enough that the menu represents a true collaboration between himself and Cory Harwell, it was as a group of six that lunch was enjoyed at Downtown Las Vegas' Carson Kitchen, an unseasonably cool and rainy Saturday doing nothing to dampen the creativity or quality of a new Spring Menu that is perhaps the restaurant's best one yet.  Familiar to locals and tourists alike, the small space originally envisioned by Kerry Simon still turning great business as rumors of others' struggles predominate discussions of DTLV dining, Spring 2016 is as close to a wholesale change as Carson Kitchen has seen since opening and with ten of twelve new plates tasted in addition to a seasonally updated Beet Salad it should go without saying that a meal whose only complaint was too much mustard on a slider went more than alright.  Dining with one longtime fan of the restaurant, plus four locals who had surprisingly never been, it was with carte blanche offered to Chef Courtney that seventeen items and two cocktails were served over a series of courses, ample descriptions plus top notch service no different than past experiences while several classics such as the chicken skins, bacon jam, oxtail risotto and Harwell's mac & cheese remain as delicious as ever.  Proudly discussing how longtime relationships with several local purveyors and farms have allowed the restaurant to maintain its wallet-friendly focus despite ever increasing food costs and rent that seems to stifle all but the most popular bars around, lunch began with a refreshing salad of white and green asparagus beneath creamy burrata and green goddess dressing before veering into gastro-pub territory with tender beef belly on rye buns plus a kick of cabbage partially drowned out by too much mustard while the follow-up of Hot Oysters was a daring dish executed perfectly as pork, chicken and bivalve were all delicious and crispy dredged in fiery Crystal-infused sauce.  Extinguishing the heat with a pair of Gin-based Cocktails, the 68+1 particularly noteworthy for those who want something sweet and smooth while The Magarian is a refreshing sort of drink that puts spirits in the spotlight, nut-free Pesto Marghertia Flatbread proves a veritable ode to basil as herbal aromatics greet the nostrils from several feet away beneath thick slices of skinless tomatoes and puddles of ricotta, undoubtedly a great vegetarian option for those who may not be keen on the concept of Bacon Jam...as silly that may seem.  Whimsically offering up pierogis that seem torn between Eastern European traditions, Flattop steak by way of Philly and whiz given a Southern pimento twist, the new menu's shining star is undoubtedly Chef Courtney's Shrimp Dunderi that marries snappy prawns to Parisian gnocchi in a citrus sauce bolstered by Calabrian chilis, each bite as sophisticated as anything being offered On-Strip or elsewhere in the city despite the mere $14 price point.  Having recently returned from Colorado it was with great interest that Carson Kitchen's Lamb Chops were presented alongside two classic sides and rainbow cauliflower that avoids the mistake of muting the crucifer by presenting it simply with a kiss of garlic plus acid, and at $18 for two T-Bone chops served rare with a pistachio crust over mint chimichurri the robust meat outpaces portions nearly half the size for twice the cost high in the Rockies, yet another strong testament to the quality of Courtney and Harwell's ingredient sourcing.  Forced to alter Bread Pudding since the closure of O-Face, and actually improving the dish in the process by deciding to dry the donuts before soaking them in custard, Harwell's Banoffee Pie and Bourbon Fudge Brownie continue to reign as two of Downtown Las Vegas' best desserts while the Springtime Rhubarb Sammy finally offers a lighter option to those looking for a sweet finale, the macaron shining in part due to Courtney's time working with Jean-Philippe but more so due to the sour rhubarb sorbet and fragrant elderflower whipped cream.  ***** Recovering from a winter menu that seemed overworked and heavy handed, Spring has unquestionably sprung at Carson Kitchen and although old favorites remain as good as ever there is little doubt Chef Courtney has brought something new to the kitchen that continues to reinvent itself while raising the bar for everyone else."}

We ordered the tempura green beans with pepper jelly cream cheese, the veal meatballs with sherry foie gras cream, coco expresso NY strip with red wine demi sauce, black rice oxtail risotto, mac and cheese and of course the glazed donut bread pudding for dessert.  The portions were perfect for the both of us as we devoured about 95% of all the food. Our server even brought us some extra bread to make small bites with the steak and mac and cheese, genius!

I loved the entirety of the staff. It seemed like they were all best friends, and I would love to hang out with them.   The food was AMAZING. It's all tapas serving style, so get several plates and share it all! We got a ton of different dishes, and I will give a brief report on each of them.   The young beets has beets (two kinds), grapes, and goat cheese. I love the goat cheese, and the beets were really tasty!  The veal meatballs were also very good. They were spicy, but also had a sweet taste. They were perfectly cooked, not too dry.  The crispy chicken skin was a great way to start. They taste like really light fried chicken and they come with a honey dipping sauce.   The pig and fig flat bread was not what I expected. It's like a pizza with fig paste sauce, pork two ways, and arugula. It was both sweet and savory, perfectly balanced!   The baked Mac and cheese was INCREDIBLE. It was extra cheesy and creamy. I have no doubt it was the best Mac and cheese I have ever had. Wow.   The real star of the show was the glazed donut bread pudding. This is by far the best dessert I've ever had in my life. It was so sweet, milky, and caramelized. It literally melted in your mouth and left you wanting more and more. I may have shed a few tears eating it.   Everything was presented in a very cool way. The unique bowls and boards were such a nice touch. Our check even came stuck into the pages of a book. I loved everything about my experience here."}

The food was incredible, like a taste explosion in your mouth!! But the music, and i love good ole rock in roll, was so loud, we couldn't even talk.  Asked waiter if maybe they wouldn't mind turning it down a little.  Guess not. Oh well, if i was more informed that this is really just a loud bar with great food, but i was expecting a nice laid back leisurely lunch. Loved all the food we ordered, but go by yourself, cuz you won't be able to talk to anyone!!"}

The set up is cool... small 2 and 4 tops around the perimeter and larger snaking tables that move into the bar hat are more family style which was cool, all 4 of us (me and the hubs + the two other people) were at the family style table and struck up some convo.   on to the food We had the crispy chicken skin, the italian sausage flatbread and the risotto.   Now the hubs mistakenly ordered the skins thinking it would be a chicken finger-esque type thing.  They were spiced, not too salty and served with a dish of honey.  After eating the first i wasn't too sure, but they grew on me... sweet and savory, I would get it again.   I had the flatbread, yummy, decent size... I recall it being called spicy Italian sausage flatbread without mention of the broccoli that was on it.  Very... Different... I tied it.. and ended up picking any of the larger pieces off.   Hubbs had the risotto... Ox tail risotto.  Now being italian to me risotto is strictly made with arborio rice.  The end.  This was made with like a black wild rice... It had a bit more of  a bite than I would like, and that wild rice flavor... but was decent.  I would not get that again, but I know I'm very  picky when it comes to italian foods.    Being monday afternoon I wasn't trying to get hammered, but did have the only apple hard cider they had, Ace i believe? It was the best cider I've ever had.    and whatever you do, don't park in the lot across the street! insta-tow will get your car before you've crossed the street"}

I've only been here a few times but I've noticed the menu has changed very slightly with each visit.   Last night we ordered the crispy chicken skins, rainbow cauliflower, shrimp dunderi, and jerk turkey burger. The chicken skins are served with smoked honey and oh so addictive. They are best enjoyed fresh as they can become slightly hard and chewy if you leave them sitting towards the end of your meal. The cauliflower was crunchy, lemony, and refreshing. The shrimps were huge and the dunderi was pillowy perfection. It's basically gnocchi that is made with cheese rather than potatoes. Need I say more? The turkey burger was the real highlight of last night's meal. The patty was huge and juicy. I totally forgot that it was turkey! The sweetness from the mango chutney slaw complemented it so well, I wish it had more.   I'd love to see this place expand to a larger locations. Not a huge fan of communal seating since I'm a lefty and always end up bumping someone's elbow. It's a small price to pay for delicious food. I'll be back!"}

We had ordered the deviled eggs and chicken skins to start off with.   The eggs were so soft and very airy and the chicken skins were the crunchiest I've ever had.   We each ordered different entrees, but we had ordered the butter burger, which was a perfect medium-rare, the chicken thighs, rabbit ragu, and the black rice risotto.   I ordered the risotto and it was a smooth, creamy texture and the black rice was al dente, just how I like it. The rabbit ragu was hearty and the rabbit wasn't very gamey. The butter burger was juicy and flavourful and the chicken thighs with chimichurri were herby and light.  All in all, this place should be on everyone's list of places to eat. Definitely worth it."}

They now have a MMM Rib sandwich but without the best dill sauce ever it doesn't even compare.

I went with three other people and we ordered a bunch of things and shared.  We got the tempura green beans, jalapeño poppers, crispy chicken skins, baked mac n cheese, bacon jam, devil's eggs, and the chili cheese dog flatbread.  I think that covers it... everything was excellent and the standout for me was the tempura green beans.  Everyone in my group had a different favorite, though.  The crispy chicken skins were also awesome, but definitely needs to be shared between a few people.  I loved our server as well.  He was so nice and helpful.  The place seems very tiny for what I'm used to seeing in Vegas, maybe like 10 tables altogether plus seating at the bar?  We arrived at 3pm so it was kind of an off hour and we were seated right away.  I can imagine with how delicious the food is that there might be a bit of a wait at times during more normal dinner time hours.  The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs at work.  No secrets here!  The only bad thing I have to say is that one staff member who appeared to be a manager of sorts was kind of a dick.  We had requested some more bread for the bacon jam from our server and this manager guy was the one to bring it over.  He kind of flopped it on the table and said bread with a grimace and walked away.  I've had a couple friends who have also eaten here recently share about similar encounters.  Not sure what his problem is, but the rest of this place is redeeming enough that I would still come back and give it a 5 star review."}

There were so many interesting things to eat, we couldn't fit them all in one trip so, of course, we had to go back to try them all!  The chicken skins were so good. If you like pork rinds, you will love the chicken skins. Not one bit of greasiness and the seasoning is so good. Not salty with a bit of spiciness. We had the bacon jam as well. It's made with jalapeños so it may be too hot for some people but it was good, I just thought it was hard to pair with the food we were trying to sample. The staff is friendly and helpful.

I see the vision of the chef but the execution wasn't quite there. Perhaps adding a whole ox tail piece with it's super tender meat falling off easily place on top of the Risotto?

We were seated right away and were attended to promptly. Service was good but the portions were very small compared to the price we paid and some of the stuff was a bit salty but the flavor was good.   We ordered:  Tempura Green Beans: This was the absolute surprise of the day. Tempura green beans are exactly how they sound but the pepper jelly cream cheese they served it with was so good!. The creaminess of the cheese with the sweetness of the pepper jelly complimented the mild flavor of the green beans. Although a bit oily for me, it was nevertheless, my favorite dish. Good portion  Cocoa- Expresso crusted Steak- It was very salty in my opinion. The crust itself was very salty on the end pieces but for the middle slices, it worked well. The meat was good. I would have preferred it a bit more rare but it was good the way they served it.   Rabbit Ragu- This was very good. The rabbit was cooked well with crunchy pieces of pancetta? or was it rabbit? Either way, the sauce worked well with the meat and complimented the spaghetti squash. Portion was super small in my opinion for the $12? $14 dollars I paid. If i really crave it, i would order it again but I think I'll opt for something else next time.   Hawaiian Flat Bread- Flatbread served with spiced rum pineapple and ham, sprinkled with chives. It was alright. The pineapple was delicious. It was a very bold and sweet flavor. The ham however, was salty and overpowered the pineapple which was a shame. Also a bit pricey but it's Vegas so I can't say anything there.   Overall it was a good experience. Good food although a bit salty and great customer service.

Makes sense, it just wasn't my fav dish, but we ate it all. Feel like that dish needs some adjusting. There was a party of 3 behind me - they had a 45 min wait.. And there was a 17 year old with them so sitting at the bar was not an option. I told them to wait as it was well worth it, and there options on Fremont Street are not to be compared on all levels! Get here early to avoid a wait if you are hungry. The space is small - but functions, well. It was cold outside, so everyone was waiting inside, and I could feel the energy from the folks that wanted to get seated and eat. I could have stayed to enjoy another glass of wine, chat up with my friend, but felt bad for the hungry people, so we split."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "After my second mediocre experience here, I thought I better write up a review. This place has tons of hype which may be why I found it so disappointing.    Ambiance - There are only 4 actual tables at this restaurant all the other seating is at group dining bars where your legs dangle while you sit in their uncomfortable bar chairs. The first time I ate here we were seated at the actual bar and while it was very loud in the restaurant I was able to enjoy my friends company.   On my second trip here we were seated at the shared table across from a couple who had their tongues down each other's throat the whole time and a father who was lecturing his daughter loudly on how to make it in the business world and she better shape up or ship out.  I understand this is not within the restaurants control however I would certainly prefer to have an option rather than shared dining but as a party of two we were not afforded that luxury.   Service - The first visit they were busy but by sitting at the bar we were able to flag down the bartender to get our orders relatively fast. The second visit I arrived first and my server asked if I would like to wait to order, I informed him I would order before my companion arrived but I needed a minute to look over the menu. After waiting for him to return for some time I turned awkwardly around from my place at the bar extension to place my order for a drink with the bartender. My drink arrived but still no server so again I ordered our appetizer from the bar. The place was busy but there was plenty of servers and I spent the rest of the dinning experience hunting down my server. When it came time to pay I ended up getting off the horrible chair to just find someone to pay so that I no longer had to sit on those horrid chairs and I could get out of there.   Food - The first trip we ordered: Jalapeno Poppers - Delicious, I recommend them highly Baked Mac & Cheese - Excellent if not a bit on the small side Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto - Such high hopes, but way over salted and the rice was not cooked it was crunchy  Second and last trip: Bacon Jam - Zero flavor, the best part was the bread Roasted young beets - meh nothing special here at all Pork Belly Carbonara- Again high hopes only to be let down, the pork was fine but nothing special the pasta was mediocre  The uncomfortable seating, small pretentious menu and awful service will keep me from coming back."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Wow, we had a terrible experience here.    Upon arrival on a Thursday evening with a group of 4 we were told there was a 45 min wait. No problem there at all. We know the drill and have eaten at many small and popular  places in the past. We grabbed drinks at the bar and snagged a seat by the super nice fire pit.  About 45 min later the hostess comes out and says that their larger tables are done dining but are still chatting. Again, I understand. I run a small business in the service industry myself and these things can be hard to manage. Another 20 min goes by with smaller parties getting seated one after another.  The hostess again comes and apologizes saying the other parties just simply wont leave.  After ten more minutes one of our guests actually kindly approached one group of guests at the bar and explained the situation and they gladly gave up their bar seats.  It is a bummer to have to sit at a bar with 4 people after such a long wait but such is life.    Upon sitting at the bar it seemed pretty clear that the bartender either was having a rough night or just didn't quite appreciate our presence. However, the old fashioned she made for me was delicious.  That was about the only thing any of us enjoyed during the visit.  I was stoked to try the gyro tacos and was incredibly disappointed. The mac and cheese was pretty good but the oxtail risotto was pretty awful.  Sitting at the bar we struggled  to get our waters refilled and never got any sort of acknowledgment or apology for our 90 minute wait for bar seats after being quoted a 45 min wait. We just sat quietly disappointed eager to finish eating and leave.  I am not sure that I have ever left a negative review for a restaurant nor have I ever sent a dish back. Generally, I am pretty patient with mistakes especially when they are acknowledged, but I was shocked by the lack of hospitality we experienced.  It is also worth mentioning that while we were leaving, the party that was holding up the table was still sitting down with their food in to-go containers just talking.    This place is cool and interesting but lacks heart.  It felt like they wanted our money and for us to ohh and ahh over their innovation but at the end of the day it never felt like the staff had any interest in making you feel comfortable, seen, or appreciated. While leaving this review I noticed the way the owner responds to negative feedback that he feels is unwarranted. I cant help but think that sort of culture is exactly what contributed to our experience.  Maybe it was a bad day, maybe this place is as awful as I think it is. Either way, I think there are a lot better places to spend your money and time while in Vegas."}

The burrata and asparagus salad (which also had summer peas and something else...fennel?) was fresh and perfect for the heat. The oxtail and black rice risotto was tangy and sweet, fun texture. The gyro tacos were a fun appetizer of sorts. We would have ordered a few more dishes if we hadn't have dinner plans already. Come by if you're feeling off-strip for a casual, chill atmosphere and some fun dishes.  The 3 small plates plus a drink was something like $70, I think, but both tummies definitely had space on our way out. (Space for... giant donuts next door, actually.)"}

I offered to bring my own food or eat prior to the visit if it was an issue. They assured me that they could accommodate my allergies and prevent from calling attention to the issues during the meal. Emails back and forth followed and they worked closely with me in making sure all ingredients were safe for me.

I feel like the menu changes semi frequently, so I'll refrain from commenting on each individual dish.  My complaints:   1. The setup - Come in the winter on a windy day and when the door opens, all your stuff gets blown over and you turn into a popcicle. Come in on a summer day and when the door opens, your stuff gets blown over and you melt into a pile of sweat. 2. Their prices - Carson Kitchen costs more than some places on the Strip!

Cauliflower - garlic & lemon juice, not too hard to ruin Beets - was decent, nothing special. I would expect the veggies to be nice and cold and refreshing The oxtail risotto - STICKY and THICK mess.

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Another great trip to Carson Kitchen. The beet plate, oxtail risotto, and donut bread pudding continue to be the amazing classics that they have been since opening. Today I tried for the first time their Mac, shrimp app, and pecorino plum salad. The Mac is amazing, worth it (kind of wish I ordered the bbq thighs to pair it with). The shrimp app will be my new go-to here, it's a cross between Chinese take out honey walnut shrimp and nachos in the best way possible, amazing. The salad, though something that did not expect - I was hoping for something presented like the beet plate - was very fresh and flavorful (amazing date vin) but in my opinion portioned poorly for the 13 dollar price.    Past experiences: I've been coming here on and off for over two years and I've tried a lot of dishes some of which have stuck to the menu. Most importantly of which is the coffee rubbed strip, which is one of best pieces of steak in town, especially considering the price. If you're really hungry and don't mind something super rich I also recommend the bacon jam, it's unusual compared to other iterations I've had - note that it's huge, too much for two people in my opinion.   Also something that I've tried a lot of are all of the cocktails here, all of which are great. This is one of the best cocktail programs in town for sure.   I wholeheartedly suggest visiting here. Good food and great vibes, it's made to become your regular place for get togethers or just grabbing a drink and a bite."}

Tucked away  in DTLV near other new little hot spots around the Fremont area is this awesome little Resturant. Driving by you would know much of it but step inside and you will find yourself in a hip cool Resturant.   It's not that big but not that small either with a great bar and a cool little kitchen counter type thingy. Prior to coming here I've been doing my homework and had a list of items that I wanted to try but bringing that that would be almost their entire menu I had to pick and choose.   So here is what I went with  Their signature Bacon Jam- 3/5 good great concept but it wasn't my favorite or I won't rub tho back for it. You must try at least once for yourself to judge if you are crazy about it or not.  The deviled eggs-5/5 some might say it's just like any other deviled eggs and I might agree but the texture of the egg was perfect and I love the fact that they classed it up with the caviar and the pancetta added the right amount of crispy fatty goodness I loved it.  The truffles mac and cheese- freaking 10/5 no really it was so cheesy with the right amount of truffle flavor you can't go wrong. It's more like crack and cheese instead of mac and cheese!  Finally we has the Butter Burger w/spicy tots-5/5 it was so freaking good. Burger was so juicy and had amazing flavor topped with all kinds of cheese and veggies. The bun was delicious and toasty and the spicy tots were crispy and season so good that plate also was on point.  For the {Libation} because no good love story or any story begins with someone ordering a salad we ordered the Magarian drink which had a bunch of stuff in it but it had me at cucumber soda and gin...the most refreshing drink ever with a great flavor of lemon, honey syrup and a hint if thyme who wouldn't want to just drink that all day in the hot summer heat then we got the St. Stephane's Belgian Blonde beer. All beer are in bottles nothing on tap but who cares when they are all so good.   All in all I can't wait to come back and try everything else like their chicken skins and their beef Wellington empanadas plus sip on their other Findlay crafted drinks."}

I've taken a couple of my friends here as an introduction to the DTLV scene, and so far so great with their reaction. I've had one friend order the Beef Stroganoff, another the Rabbit Ragu. Both enjoyed their dishes quite a lot.  Bottomline, love this place. 5 stars for sure."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Its been a few months since I visited Vegas but I still remember one particular place that we ate, Carson Kitchen in the Downtown Fremont Street area. The restaurant is one of many that are owned by the late Celebrity Chef Kerry Simon and it is one of the select few great meals that I have had at a well known chefs place in Vegas.  Carson kitchen is hidden away on Carson and 6th street and was so hidden that our cab driver actually had a hard time finding it and dropped us off almost two blocks away. After a few minutes walking around a rather sketchy part of town we finally noticed the name painted on a window and knew we had found the right place.  Once inside you will find a small dining area with nothing but family style seating. You will have two options...snuggle up and make some friends or go someplace else. I would suggest make some friends because you do not want to miss any of the food that is about to be placed in front of you. Everything on the menu sounds mouth watering good so it was hard to decided on just a few choices. My wife and I decided to go with three sharing plate choices and then a dessert. We started off with Bacon Jam and Grilled Baguettes, then Fried Tempura Green Beans, Fried Chicken Skins and then finished it all off with Doughnut Bread Pudding. The small size of the sharing plates did not matter as the huge flavors more then filled us up.  Like many before me, the highlight of the meal was the sweet and luxurious Bacon Jam. I was smart and ordered extra baguette bread so that none of it would go to waste. The jam was insanely smokey and sweet but with a slight kick of heat that hit the tongue right at the end. There were hunks of bacon and onion laced throughout it and it was capped off with creamy Brie Cheese. Unbelievably decadent and good. Nothing after that could really compare to the bacon jam but it was all very good.  The Chicken Skins were airy and crispy with a flavor and look reminiscent of pork rinds, they were served with sweet honey for dipping. The Tempura Battered Green Beans were crispy and not at all greasy and were served with a mildly spiced red pepper jelly. I would be lying if I said I didn't dip them both in my Bacon Jam.  Dessert can best be described as sex on a plate. Doughnut Bread Pudding that was made with a fresh Honey Glazed doughnut from the bakery right next door. The sinful donuts are baked in an egg custard and then topped with a sweet spiked Bourbon and Honey sauce. The waitress actually threatened to steal the dessert leftovers from us (and judging by the look in her eye she was not kidding) so we were obliged to finish the entire plate of happiness. This was such an amazing meal that I have no choice but to give it 5 stars. It is a fitting tribute to Kerry Simon and his culinary talents."}

This was my second Vegas visit where our team incorporated Carson's- and it won't be our last.  We waited about 15 minutes before they were able to seat us. No big deal, we cozied up to the outdoor fire pit, and laughed, drinks in hand. Upon being seated, our server set us up with a fresh round of drinks. I had been elected to place our tables order. (This is trouble) There were seven of us, so we ordered a ton: Fried chicken skins: ok, hear me out on this one. I'm fully aware that chicken skins are the least healthy party of the chicken, but equally, they may be the most delicious. Especially when you deep fry them, and serve them with a smoky honey. (I love honey!) Three different burgers: butter, bison, not sure the last. that we cut like a pizza and shared. The sweet potato tater-tots were a table wide hit. Bacon Jam (this is an epic dish of bacon, some fruit, and Brie that you spread on crispy bread slices). Highly addictive. Completely unhealthy, totally worth it. Spicy shrimp: crispy and coated with a spicy mayonnaise, these were a popular, rich treat. Truffle Mac and cheese: mind blown- this was amazing. Unsurpassed deliciousness coated in cheese and baked to nice brown top.  Braised pork belly: this was a close second to the Mac and cheese. Very close. It was succulent, tender, flavorful and I had more than my fair share ;) Tri-color cauliflower: this was tangy and a wild adventure. Also, the healthiest thing we ordered. Gyro-tacos: sounded weird, but these were superb. Flavorful meat, and the prefect tzatziki sauce. Wild mushroom flatbread: perfectly crisp, great portions of toppings and yummy! I was a few Tito's and cranberry in, so I'm not sure if I missed anything else. I feel like I may have excluded something. Oh, then dessert. Bread pudding Bacon Icecream. (Never had anything close) The chocolate cake, also amazing.  As you can gather from reading the above, we enjoyed everything, and still kept eating.

Come to Carson Kitchen and see what Cory Harwell and head chef Scott Simon are up to with this dish named simply Red Radish.  Four of us came here last week to sample some items from the new menu and as usual, the fare is creative and very tasty.  Here is a list of what we tried with the menu descriptions:  Cheese and crackers--piquillo pub cheese, lavash Pork wings--buffalo bleu beurre blanc Plum and pecorino--candied almond, rosemary date vin Crispy chicken skins--smoked honey Peach panzenella--tomato, zucchini, tomato peach vin Everything bagel flatbread--smoked salmon, cream cheese mascarpone Black kale and watermelon--manchego, walnut, lemon mint vin Wild mushroom flatbread--tikka masala, smoked mozzarella Red radish--baby bok choy, miso honey butter, cashew Sugar snap peas--smoked paprika butter, harrisa cream Lamb spiedies--house giardiniera, garlic aioli Chicken thighs Alabama--white barbeque Peach upside-down cake--crafthaus zitrone, whipped mascarpone Bourbon fudge brownie--brown butter bacon ice cream  Each time I come here, I am amazed at the creativity of the menu items.  There are a number of new things here.  The two new salads--plum and pecorino and peach panzenella are excellent.  The black kale salad needed more watermelon for my taste.    The two flatbreads were great with my favorite being the everything bagel with its smoked salmon, cream cheese mascarpone, and crispy poppy seed flatbread.  What a great combination.  The red radish.  I have to mention it.  The flavor that you get from cooking the radish changes it somewhat so that with the bok choy, miso honey butter, and cashews, it becomes a dish that brought a smile to my face.  I said something to the table along the lines of, Who would have thought of cooking radishes?    Ending the tasting--all dishes were shared by the four of us--were the desserts; one new and an old standard.  The new peach upside-down cake is excellent.  The old standard--bourbon  fudge brownie--is always good and should always be on the menu!  Service was exceptional as always.

I ordered the coffee rubbed ny steak for $19. It's not pricy for red meat but it came with nothing else. Only meat. By far not the best steak I've had. I didn't taste any coffee but was happy that it came out medium rare like I asked for. I also tried my friend's beef stroganoff which I did not like. The portion size was super small and to me it tasted oddly like chocolate.   I also tried the bison sliders. They were a little dry but I enjoyed the flavor of the meat and the sweet jam it came with. All burgers and sandwiches came with a side of spicy tator tots which were delicious!  By far the best thing there. I also tried the lamb gyros. For $10 bucks you get three gyro tacos and they were pretty yummy. Best bang for your buck.   The restaurant is small and can get really loud.  But it has a very cozy hipster atmosphere. I don't think I will come back again but it's a cool hangout spot."}

He had absolutely zero complaints & that is UNHEARD of coming from him (he's a chef) LOL Any way - he wanted to leave because I didn't see too many vegan options for myself, but I insisted we stayed cause I thought this would be perfect for him, & I was certainly right! As for me, I got the rainbow cauliflower & tater tots cause I was really worried about disliking the other options (not that they have very many cause most of their dishes have dairy.) So this place is GREAT for vegetarians & carnivores but not so exciting for vegans. I'm just glad my bf finally left a restaurant happy for once!"}

The staff were all super friendly and attentive. The decor inside is very cool and modern, great for taking lots of pictures.  We ordered the Bacon and Brie jam, cocoa espresso rubbed NY strip and the salmon. Each dish's flavor was off the charts. Now I just have the challenge of going back to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "The food and service here is delicious and straight to the point! I can't rave enough on what an incredible dining experience we had here. Another yelper commented on how the restaurant and ambiance reminded them of being in San Francisco and I agree. I definitely didn't feel like I was in Vegas anymore. I loved the restaurant's quaint and modern design but I especially enjoyed the charming ambiance on their roof top dining area, the booths were very comfortable and there was just the right amount of lighting too.    Now, let's get to the good stuff: the food!    The crispy chicken skins arrived with a side of smoked honey for dipping = insane! Honey Boo Boo, this thing is real good! The skins were seasoned expertly and fried to crazy, crispy perfection; I couldn't get enough of that airy, crunchy skin - it wasn't even oily. Don't even get me started on the smoked honey -delectable- you can bet your sweet life they were meant to be eaten together. It's a must-order and for $6, the portion was perfect for two.   We also went all in on the bacon jam with baked brie and grilled baguette at $12, It's the most popular item on the menu and now I know why. It came out bubbling hot and was incredibly bacon-y, jam-y, brie-y, salty, sweet and, yes, it was pretty darn magical.   To offset the naughtiness that is crispy chicken skins and bacon jam, we also ordered roasted young beets with pistachio, mandarin orange slices and goat cheese at $8. The beets were roasted till perfect tenderness, naturally sweet, and the dish was simple but very tasty. It was the perfect option to complement the richness of the bacon jam.   We also grabbed an order of the black rice and oxtail risotto with Parmesan cream for $14, though, we thought it was way too cheesy (if that's even a problem?) Based on the menu description, we were expecting more of a smoother Parmesan cream-like consistency, but we ended up with more of a dense, stringy texture. Our waitress was wonderful and could tell that we weren't too thrilled with the consistency when she checked on us, so she generously offered to replace the dish with something else that we would be able to enjoy. We decided on the rabbit ragu with spaghetti squash and Parmesan at $12 - everything on this dish was seasoned very well; I also really enjoyed the light tomato cream sauce and the perfectly cooked spaghetti squash. Surprisingly, the overall dish wasn't too heavy. I personally wouldn't order it again, (rabbit is just not my thing) but my boyfriend went to town on it and really enjoyed it.    I'm completely satisfied with the level of service and care that we were offered here. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with everything we ordered, plus the simply tasty food is well worth a quick return! I can't wait to come back and order some more of those chicken skins all to myself!"}

It's a pretty small place and it's a lot of open/social seating so don't be surprised when they sit you next to other people.  Also, it's more of a small plates type place.  I recommend planning to share and spending a decent amount of cash.  I had glanced at the menu so I was expecting $15-20 a person, but realistically $30-50 a person will be a more enjoyable experience.  Everything we ordered was great.  I devoured the veal meatballs.. sooo much flavor.  I wish it would've came with more.  The secret sunday chicken sandwich was very tasty and I recommend that as well.  And you must finish with the glazed donut bread pudding.  It was so delicious!  We also ordered some german potato salad, cauliflower, and a pork chop as well.  Those were all great, but not as highly recommended as the options I mentioned previously.  Get here early if you can. I would imagine this place would be pretty hard to come to with a large group.  This place should be on your must-try list."}

I added another star for the obvious (and it is obvious) effort the owner is putting into customer satisfaction.  Local old fart here - I found this place to be more hip-to-the-skip than a restaurant with substance. The food is overpriced for the uniqueness it's trying hard to achieve. Granted, I only ate here once during lunch...ordered the Pig & Fig, but I found the entire experience to be meh. The balance of flavors was off in a potentially delicious fare - the sweetness of the fig overpowered the pork and goat cheese. Staff was friendly enough yet it felt superficial. Sorry, just not a fan."}

We came here during Life if Beautful weekend for lunch. We sat on the upstairs open air patio which is nice to do in Vegas when weather permits.  We had the truffled deviled eggs (delish and good portion) to share. My wife got the beet salad which was well made and just enough to hold her over for dinner. I got the lamb tacos, which were also delicious, however the amount of meat was not nearly enough to satiate me.... I was a little hungry when we walked away. That is my only complaint.  They had some create cocktails and a decent beer/wine list. I had the malbec ($9) and it was decent. If you are looking for something unique and tasty, I recommend giving this place a shot."}

These were probably my favorite items we ate. Get these if you come here! :)  Tempura green beans were a hearty portion and came with a great dipping sauce, but our favorite veggie dish was the rainbow cauliflower.  So good!   Catfish sandwich was filling without feeling heavy, which I liked... The bread was crispy and the fish was flaky, light and well seasoned and the spicy tater tots were delicious!!!  My least favorite dish was the pesto flatbread which was a little on the heavier/salty side for my taste, but all around, this was a great dining experience here and I would definitely recommend giving it a try!"}

Its behind the strip so you aren't overloaded with all of the mess there but just close enough to safely walk. It is definitely not for large groups as the seating is small tables for about 4 or so.   The beer and wine list is a great selection. I had a glass of rose that was crisp and not too sweet. They have beer from the local brewery Big Dog as well which is a great touch. I will say the beer options are limited for non IPA lovers so be aware of that. We each had a couple of different appetizers to share and none of them were disappointing. Between all of we shared the chicken skin, bbq burnt ends, bacon jam, and pig & fig flatbread.  All of the food was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The chicken skin was addictive on its own but add the honey and its so many flavors in each bite. The burnt ends were flavorful and just sweet enough with the sauce being the stand out part. Now the best for me was the pig and fig flatbread. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and paired great with the goat cheese. It was salty sweet and just a bit tart. Get this when you go here.   Also on top of all of this the staff was amazing. We showed up with a large party not knowing the layout of the restaurant and had to wait a while. With all of the confusion and miscommunication the staff was A+ with service and made sure to make up for any of the confusion on our part."}

It was pretty packed on a Saturday morning- it's not a place you can go to sit and read for hours.  We ordered the thai chicken flat bread. Not spicy, perfect size for two, not heavy on the cheese. 4/5 The spicy shrimp was a 5/5 for me. Perfect combo of sweet and spicy.   I don't have an issue with this but.... A couple came in with two screaming kids and were given cold looks from other customers throughout their meal. Why would you bring your kids here, was said by the couple across from them multiple times and loud enough for them to hear. Carson Kitchen might not be the place to bring them."}

I think the winner overall was the chicken sandwich - fresh and moist white meat fried chicken in a pretty amazing bun with something akin to a secret sauce that was a perfect match. The spicy tots that came with it were also great, maybe the best tots I have had in a LOOOOOONG time. The cauliflower was good, but some pieces were cold in the middle, not really a game changer because at least they weren't mushy but a little, I don't know, weird? Super garlicky for sure, so prepare yourself for that. The short rib grilled cheese was good but I almost feel like I would have rather just hunkered down with the chicken sandwich. I am probably going to have dreams about that sandwich now... mmm... chicken....  Nice spot, my only compliant really is that all the seats at the regular tables are stools without seat backs.

I've also been here for my post-workout birthday lunch and a few other times...all because of a bowl of vegetables!  Chicken: Chicken thigh that's simple but tasty. The skin is crisp but not overcooked. It's quite juicy. I paired this with their broccoli which was a bit spicy 4.5/5  Rainbow Cauliflower: This is my favorite item on the menu. I never thought I'd say that the best dish I've had was a bowl of veggies let alone cauliflower! What crazy friggin ish is that? As a matter of fact, I crave a bowl all the time now. Garlicky, a bit of spice and a bit citrusy. I could eat this all day. A glowing 5/5  Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak: Tender slices of beef with pink on the middle. Earthy and nutty because of the cocoa espresso but without being bitter. 4/5  Swordfish:  Flaky white fish with lemon, mint and basil. Refreshing, light and delicious 5/5  Young Beets: I don't normally get too crazy over beets. The texture is mushy and tastes like dirt - CK was able to make me like beets. 4/5  Gyro Tacos: Greek tacos with tender meat, feta and onions. Nothing complicated here. 4/5  Chicken Skin: Comes with honey to dip the crunchy salty goodness that is chicken skin. Forget your healthy eating habits for a moment and indulge in this basket of magnificence. *crunch crunch crunch crack crack crack* was all I heard when this was brought to our table. 5/5  Tomato Stack: Caprese salad, basically. 4/5  Mac n Cheese: I don't know how they made such a simple comfort food to be better than most places. The crispy top, the creamy cheese sauce...yuuuummm!!! 5/5  Devil's Eggs: Deviled eggs with caviar and pancetta. Absolutely delicious. With the caviar and pancetta, I thought this would be salty but I was wrong. Different textures in my mouth. 4.5/5  They have a few tables by the window, a few stools by the kitchen and by the bar, and a community table. They also have outdoor seating.

Street parking near by is metered, so be sure to pay enough time so you're not interrupted meter feeding half way thru your meal.    Restaurant was remodeled and expanded since our last visit.  Looks like they blew out the wall to extend the bar.  Funky modern vibe, lots of plaid and a lot more ink, a little less sleeve atmosphere.   The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs working their magic first hand.  As in any good chef's kitchen, noise was minimal.  No pots and pans banging about.  We felt the best way to experience Carson was to order a lot of appetizer bites for the entire table to share.   We ordered the bacon jam that's absolutely to die for yummy!  The Devil's eggs were good, but honesty....every picnic I've ever been to has their own rendition.  Theirs happened to be topped with caviar.   The veal meatballs with peas were outstanding!  Hard to have just one!  Melt in your mouth delicious.   Portions were good sized and enough for a table of 4 to share.    One of us ordered the Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich.  Tender juicy chicken on an aioli smeared brioche bun.  Another at the table - dear Lord was on a diet in Vegas - ordered a Green Goddess Caesar salad.    We all waited and salivated for dessert.   The Glazed Donut Bread pudding sounds heavy....but it's really a light treat. Caramel and rum covers a light fluffy donut.  Just enough to share with the table and get a few bites to satisfy you.  We liked it so much we nearly licked the bowl clean!  The Bourbon Fudge Brownie was outstanding!  Super rich dense chocolate flavor topped with ice cream and bacon bits.  Out of this world.

Not terrible service but did hinder the experience. Service aside , we were so impressed with the food that the it didn't matter however wouldn't return due to service. It is definitely worth going to on food alone."}

The tempura green beans & Mac and cheese were the table favorites. Everyone also enjoyed some spicy shrimp appetizer, the mushroom flat bread and the burger w/ spicy tots (the burger was HUGE). We ordered 5 plates to share and it was too much food. We should have only ordered 3.   The cool vibe of bigger bar tables is fun but it's hard to share the table with other parties sitting elbow to elbow. I was seated next to a party of 2 who ordered multiple appetizers, which gave me very little room for my plate, let alone my drink & flatware. We could have sat on the patio but it was too hot out. Elbow to elbow is the lesser of two evils.  I'd recommend this place for sure!! It's a nice break from the typical noisy, tacky and bigger Vegas spots we've tried!! Just beware, it's kind of hard to find."}

The new menu offers a shortrib with a killer pasta. I love the upstairs patio, if only because this place is so popular now that it's a bit noisy inside sometimes. I started with Bacon Jam - always a favorite. We shared small plates of crispy beans, mac n cheese, rainbow cauliflower and deviled eggs - so even my Vegan friend found a couple of dishes she could enjoy. I miss the pear persimmon salad with the brittle, as well as the Rabbit Ragu - but this menu frequently includes new dishes, so I can either experiment or stick with my favorites. Finished up with bacon ice cream, of course!"}

So dont feel intimidated like this is a place for locals or a certain type of trend because you will miss out. Everyone is super friendly and our server, wow, was super sweet, knew the menu, knows about beer (which is a super plus for us because we love beer), and was very attentive in a good way! I was very impressed with the staff and the food. We had the chicken skins and the butter burger. To me the chicken skins were okay I kind of wished we ordered something else not that they were bad they just werent what I was feeling I guess. The burger was so delicious, the burger patty was super thick and juicy. We've had a few burgers on the strip and they dont even come close to this. The burger here was so so good I highly recommend it and I can't wait to come back and try the mac n cheese and a few other things. The kitchen is open so you can watch them prep and make food while you eat. They  have a decent selection of beer that is not your usual everyday beer. Awesome place!"}

The Butter Burger was so good, along w the Mac n Cheese, which was more creamy than gooey cheese. I personally like more gooey/melty cheese. And the Fried Chicken Skins were awesome. I know it may sound like a turn off to most but they are crunchy and flavorful. Give them a try you won't be disappointed. The outside of the restaurant has windows that are grayed out so we almost thought it was closed down for a second. Our Uber driver drove right past it, so you have to look right next to the donut shop."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Carson Kitchen is a take on new American food. While it offers classic American cuisine, it also dares to take on ideas that play off classical American foods. Such examples are crispy chicken skins (a play on crispy chicken tenders) or hot oysters (a play on boneless chicken wings). When I went there, I tried to order items that aren't typically found on everyday menus. I ordered the chicken skins, the hot oysters, an asparagus burrata salad, and some crusted lamb.   Most of the food was tasty and really interesting to try out. I never thought having chicken skins would work so well as an appetizer. The hot oysters were spicy, but I really liked the idea of trying an oyster that was coated with wing sauce and out of the shell. The burrata salad was quite unique; never have had a salad like that before, but the flavors inside the salad complemented each other. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Overall, I would recommend trying it out if in the area."}

We had heard good things, so on our recent trip, we knew we were going to carve out a day for DTLV and Carson Kitchen would be on the agenda. Can I just say that THE best way to kick off a night in DTLV is here?!  We ordered drinks first - of course. From there, we knew it was only to get better, but you MUST try the Get Shorty and the Driving with the Ms. UNBELIEVABLE...and paired so well with our social plates. It was an act of God to pull me away from the bar and not order a 3rd/4th.  Sarah, our AMAZING bartender/server, was super helpful because we were pouring over the menu and being greedy little piggies...I was hell bent on ordering 3 social plates, a side of Mac 'n Cheese, and possibly a 4th social plate. She told me to slooooow my roll...it would be way too much for us and that if we were still in the market for more, we could always order another plate or two. Thank you for saving me, Sarah.  Bacon Jam: Sugar and spice and everything nice...I love EVERYTHING about this and would spread it on the toes of a stranger, walking barefoot on the strip, and gladly eat it again.   Gyro Tacos: My husband devoured - to be truthful, I was 3 bites into one (of our 4) before he swooped in to take care of the rest. The flavor of the lamb was perfect, the shell/pita was soft and chewy - perfectly done.   Chicken Skins: I can't even deal...nor will I EVER look at chicken skin the same again. Ever. Slightly spicy (not hot), paired with the sweetness of the honey. It's like crack in chip form.   Needless to say, we waddled out - sans Mac 'n Cheese - totally in love. We've found our new FAVORITE LV restaurant - hands down.   Keep up the great work, CK. We'll see you again next year!"}

As we headed towards the unlocked, unblocked, door with no closed sign or indication, the manager began yelling at us across the restaurant. His tone along with a waving finger were embarassing and offensive in a restaurant full of people. The hostess then calmly explained the patio was closed for cleaning. Not an apology or even another glance from the rude manager until we sat down to eat.   The food was decent, our group shared  several of the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The waitress, Nicole, was very nice and attentive. I was given dirty silverware and requested a clean spoon, which they brought as well as comping our dessert.   Overall, a 4/5 for food quality, but I stick to my rating of 1/5 as an overall experience based on the incident that instilled my first impression."}

Fortunately, things got better very quickly after. Roman (our waiter) was really outstanding. He was fast, courteous, and extremely helpful. We ordered 6 plates for two people to eat (this was way too much for, and Roman did warn us it was a lot). But the tastes were great. The steak was absolutely the best!!!

I would highly recommend the following:  - Gyro Tacos which comes with lamb meat, but it probably will not be everyone's cup of tea for those who like to steer away from meat that tastes too gamey. - Veal Meatballs is topped with Foie Gras cream, need I say more?  - Bacon Jam & Brie - The bacon jam comes sizzling hot with a melted slab of brie cheese on top, served with toasted bread.  - Fried Chicken Skin with Honey Dip - each piece is crisp to perfection, my friend had one order all to herself.  - Butter Burger with a side of Tater Tots - flavor packed between two soft buns.    Other things that were ordered that is worth trying:  - Smashed Potatoes - It's not mashed pototoes, it a baked potato sliced into 2-3 pieces with sour cream and chives on top. - Tempura Green Beans - A great appetizer to munch on. - NY Strip Steak - we ordered medium rare and the outcome was exactly like so, and very tender.

The meatballs weren't attractive, but they tasted really great and were in the  most delicious foie gras sherry sauce.. I really wanted to lick the plate!   Eh - Chicken skins were too spicy for us to really enjoy and honestly ate like pork rinds. I was expecting more and wasn't overly impressed. Basically think pork rinds in a basic spicy salt blend. Meh. The chili cheese dog flat bread was just OK as well. Not enough sour cream, chili was overly spicy and hot dogs weren't special. I like the idea of a chili cheese dog pizza but it wasn't as yummy as I was hoping.   WTF - $3.50 coke served in an 8 ounce glass bottle. The same ones used at the high end restaurants on the strip. Who the hell wants 8 ounces of soda? I'm not surprised high end restaurants on the strip pull this but I was annoyed by this crap at an off the strip joint.

We split a steak for dinner and it was super, super delicious. The coffee / chocolate rub was kind of charred in a super nice way with the center still rare - fantastic.

My party of 4 was told a 45 minute wait with a 6 top in plain view open. I offered to order two additional menu items to sit at the 6 top and was declined. My party ended up gong down the street, spending $60+ on appetizers and drinks to pass the time. When we returned, the 6 top was still available. But a 4 top was paying their bill and leaving. They sat us at the 4 top, and when I looked up around 10 minutes later, they say a 4 top at the original 6 top we had asked for. Completely unacceptable. I would normally rate 1 star when treated like this, but the food, our waitress, the drinks, and the ambiance were magnificent. For starters you have to try the chicken skins. Sounds weird, but served crispy with a little spice and honey to cut the spice, this is worth ordering as a meal as well. You can't go wrong with the chicken sandwich or the burger, but if you are adventurous, try the black rice and oxtail risotto. How they were able to take the tough texture of black rice and keep the creaminess of risotto is beyond me. It was definitely a treat. Btw, we ate our food and left within 45 minutes. We could have sat at that six top and not have to walk up the road and spend additional money when we wanted to eat at Carson Kitchen the entire time"}

Yelp exists for people to see reviews like this. I posted our conversation.   Asked if a dish (artichoke appetizer) was vegan. Server said yes. Ordered it and confirmed that once again I was vegan.   Ordered it. The sauce tasted too good (even got more) to not be vegan and let's just say my vegan senses were tingling. I asked again when I was done after eating and the server once again confirmed it was vegan.   Found out the sauce wasn't vegan and was made with eggs.

Just know that there's no back support for the seats.  Our server was very attentive and accommodating. I wish I knew her name.  Right now, I'm refraining from eating meat, so coming here may not have been the best idea. Most of their vegetarian dishes are merely side dishes. Here's what we tried: Baked Mac & Cheese, Rainbow Cauliflower, and a Wild Mushroom Flatbread. The mac was the best dish of the night, the cauliflower was WAY too lemony, and the flatbread was just okay. The portions were small just like the little chair I was seated on. Even the prices seemed a bit inflated and we were not in a high rent area. Plus, it didn't look like much money went into the decor either.  Ugh, I hate to be that one, but I wasn't blown away.

I also would recommend the bourbon fudge brownie (it's got bacon). Tip: taste the ice cream and the brownie separately then together! Sooo yummy!"}

You eat meals that you think are good and then you eat at a restaurant of this caliber and realize that other food is substandard. This was probably one of the best meals I've ever eaten. We ordered the gyro tacos, butter bread burger and the glazed donut bread pudding. The portions are a little larger than tapas but definitely satisfying. It allows for you to finish with the most amazing dessert! This restaurant is a short distance from the main area of Fremont Street. Your taste buds will thank you for walking off the beaten path to find this gem!"}

I recommend going with a small group and ordering family style. That way everyone can try a bit of everything. Since the restaurant is small, you may have to wait a little for a table, however, there is a nice patio out back. I recommend grabbing a cocktail from the bar and relaxing back there until your table is ready. If you are lucky and it's chilly outside you can sit by the fire pit and get toasty."}

We ordered all three desserts in the menu -   The bread pudding was great!  The brownie was good and had a bit of cinnamon to give it a Mexican chocolate feel. The ice cream that came with it was okay.  The pie was my least favorite and was marred by the accompanying biscotti that was so hard it felt like a tooth breaker.   The service was really slow - it took about 30 minutes for our desserts to arrive.   Cool vibe inside with industrial design. Servers were nice but perhaps understaffed as we weren't given updates on why things took so long.   A decent time overall but not somewhere I'm likely to return to."}

But we were seated right away (Sunday dinner) and our server was fantastic! I'd heard about the Bacon Jam and it was good... but I think I was expecting more because it had been raved about. I had a wonderful beet salad - which I will definitely have again - and Not Your Father's Twinkies for dessert. Kerry Simon is known for these twists on sweet American junk food so this play on Twinkies is in his wheel house. They are really moist and the mandarin oranges work well. But I felt it was lacking in cream and would be better if plated with a creme or pudding. Since the menu is new, I wanted to share my feedback and the maitre d' was really glad that I did. In fact, he agreed with me and encouraged us to come back  as they continue to perfect the menu. Solid experience overall."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Carson Kitchen is a welcome addition to downtown Las Vegas.   (Rating = 3.5 ) First the food - I came for lunch and due to the price point and the fact that my stomach is often smaller than my brain thinks it is, I decided to try the two most commonly mentioned appetizers instead of entrees.  I ordered the bacon jam/brie with toast and the crispy chicken skins.  The bacon jam/brie is good.  It didn't knock my socks off but I admit there was something addictive about it and I couldn't stop eating it either. I wish there was more brie (just a small puddle in the middle of the jam was all I could see) and I wish the jam was just a bit less sweet and more smokey more brie would definitely improve this dish.  I would rate it a 4 out of 5 except the toast too dry and toasted for my preference creating too crunchy of a surface that didn't absorb any of the jam. so 3.5 Price 14.00  The Crispy Chicken Skins is a decadent fried treat accompanied by a honey dipping sauce.  The skins themselves are delicately fried so that the coating doesn't overpower the taste of the skin.  Dipped in the honey they were very good.  Dipped in the bacon jam made them even better as the taste of the skin nullified some of the sweetness of the jam and the bacon flavor went very well with the light saltiness of the skin.  4 out of 5. Price 5.00    Price point - The meal above plus an iced tea cost me $22.00 for lunch and to be honest with you the value simply wasn't there.   Even for downtown and especially for the location.  I don't feel like I received $19.00 in food quantity combined with quality.   The bacon jam was the culprit costing more than most of the sandwiches. I felt the price of the chicken skins was reasonable. 3 stars  Note: The below is for info only and did not change my score.  The ambiance is that of a busy bar. The dining area is small with several community sized tables and the setup is clearly intended to foster socializing with tablemates/bar mates. There appears to be 2 bars with seating and a handful of tables.  There is an upstairs that is open on the roof however it won't open for lunch until September or October when it is cooler.  The tables are very close together and it is difficult to move about without bumping a chair or a server scurrying to keep up with the crowd.  The location is in the recently reclaimed hotel on Carson/6th right behind the post office.  There is zero signage on Carson street to let you know they are a restaurant or even open and the windows are tinted so you can't see until you get very close.  The service at the bar was great and the bartender very friendly and informative.  The check comes in a book which has signatures and notes from other patrons written in the book, an interesting touch.    I didn't get a direct interaction with the waitstaff but observing them they all seemed very attentive to their tables and seemed to be processing food and orders quickly.    There were a few other menu items that look good and I will be back, hopefully able to move the score up a bit.  The bread pudding looked delicious."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Visiting Carson Kitchen was on my must do list for my next trip to Vegas.  A group of four of us arrived a little after 11am so there was no waiting.  We had the empanadas which were a disappointment.  The flavor was odd or off, unappetizing -- maybe it's the mushrooms.  One of the empanadas was half filled with gristle & fat which the eater spit out onto her plate.  We debated sending the dish back, hard to do when it comes with 4 bites and everyone took one.  We had the bacon jam which was good, make sure to get the extra toast. Then we had devil eggs which were average, not notable in any way except for a little caviar.  Beet salad which was fine.  The tomatoes in the stacked salad were not ripe -- something you might buy at cheap grocery store.  I know it's not quite tomato season, but the bland, hard meat of the tomato spoiled the dish.  The short rib sliders which were superb with with sweetly root beer sauce (and tater tots on the side).  I could probably eat these every day.  This would be my go-to item.  The mushroom flat bread was very good.  The gyros soft tacos were over salted.  The service was wonderful.  The scores for the food were 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, for an average a little over 3.  Very uneven food.  The rating should be 3.5.  Somewhere between A-Okay and I'm a fan.  If we had had only the sliders, bacon jam, and flat bread we might have been looking a 5 star rating.  The service makes we want to push the rating to 4, but the empandas and tomatoes make me want to keep it at three.  The food will win.  3 stars."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Such a cute restaurant! It made me think I was back in Los Angeles in Venice Beach off Abbott Kinney again. Make sure to ask if there are any available seats on the second floor to enjoy being outside and a great ambiance!    Went here with a party of 8 and kind of did family style ordering off the Social Plates (meant to be shared, or as an appetizer) The Crispy Chicken Skins with Honey are unbelievably good! Our only complaint was that there were no other dipping sauces like ranch or blue cheese. I understand that the chef does not like altering the taste of his creations but a few people at our table could not eat the honey and it left them at a disadvantage. The waiter was very nice and helpful and explained that they do not carry ranch but offered a hot sauce similar to Frank's hot sauce that could be used as a dipping sauce so that those that could not eat the honey aren't left just chomping on the lonesome crispy chicken skin. I myself thought the chicken was flavorful enough to eat without any sauce! Haha. The Gyro tacos were also an amazing choice! The lamb was perfectly seasoned and juicy! The Taziki was superb and pita was not thick and perfectly crunchy, just how I liked it! They come in an order of three but as many can me added to an order. We also ordered the pierogies, meatballs and beets. They were good also but the chicken skins and tacos are a must try!  As of drinks, do not order the Moscow Mule! It was extremely bitter! However I saw someone order something really tasty and the waiter explained it to be a spicy margarita. It was amazing! I wish I remembered the name of the drink. It was a spicy margarita topped off with a spicy rim and a lime! (I'm going to think long and hard about the name and if it comes back to me I'll definitely update my review.   Since it is a small restaurant with a smaller kitchen, the waiter warned us that the food may take a while. He explained that dishes will be taken out as they are made because the size of the kitchen and the amount of people they are cooking for. I thought it was very nice that the waiter explained this to us.   I will definitely be back here to try more on the menu!"}

The inside of the Carson kitchen matches that hip, semi-industrial vibe. Surprisingly, the clientele seems to trend away from hip and so-industrial! No big deal, but on a Friday evening, the average age was definitely over 40! I'm not one of these bacon-crazed people, but I saw that the bacon jam was the hot item, so we had to order it. Your reviews did not steer us wrong! It was awesome! Overall, we enjoyed all the food and the server delivered with excellent cocktail recommendations.  Service was friendly if a little slow.

Good, big and filling. My buddy got the osso bucco. Don't get this. It was two pieces, mostly bone and fat. a LOT of fat. One piece, was so fatty they should have been embarrassed. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and such. That was nice. We brought to the attention of the bartender and his response was, that's osso bucco right?. We really didn't like his response. You get nothing with it but the osso bucco and there was nothing hardly to eat AND it was $16. But the turkey burger was good although it was $14 I believe. A gal near us at the bar got some tempura green beans that looked really good. I think those are $8. We each got a dessert. I love sweets. I got the brownie with the butter bacon ice cream. The brownie was cold and rock hard. They should microwave it warm, then add the ice cream. I would NOT get that again. And it cost $8! The glazed donut bread pudding was good though. Get that. But share with someone as one is enough for two people. Besides it cost $8 as well. But get it and share it. Oh and there are only a few tables. The smallest being for 6 people. So go in a group or be put to sit in a line of people. You won't be facing your friends."}

The crispy chicken skins were okay to me but my son didn't like them.  The shrimp were breaded and lightly fried and then doused with this pepper cream, a little too spicy for me.  The bacon jam I didn't like but my son did.  I thought that the bacon jam was overpriced for what you got.  The one thing I did really like was the butter burger and then again the tater tots were a little on the too spicy side.  I also ordered a sangria which was average.  I think if you want to come here come here not hungry and order a drink and an appetizer and just enjoy the company and the ambiance.  It's a place where you come and bring a pre-date.  Plus the waiter was in a rush to get us out so someone else could sit down, I didn't care for that.

As other Yelpers have mentioned, it is extremely difficult to find. It is a great place to visit off strip but just know it will be a bit of a hike if you don't have a car. In addition, be ready to pay for parking. Meters and street parking can be extremely hard to come by so you may need to pay for a spot in a lot. Good news about this though, if you choose to walk around Fremont after dinner you won't have to feed the meter.  The food - so delish! Be ready to split a lot of things with your family and/or friends. Sharing is definitely the best way to go when eating at Carson Kitchen. As unhealthy as they probably are, the crispy chicken skins are to die for - so delish! I also am a sucker for good green beans - they were definitely fabulous! In addition, I loved the scallops. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu - the only item we tried that we weren't huge fans of was the crab fondue - it just wasn't really our style.   The bar service was what killed my group. The running joke was we had to order our next drink when our drink arrived as it took that long for us to get fresh ones. This could have just been a busy night or something; however it was disappointing to my group that they would have to wait a while for their next drink.

Tempura green beans were super yum, I could have eaten another entire platter of them especially with that cream cheese pepper jam dipping sauce. I had the short rib sliders and they were delectable with a nice sweetness to the meat. My husband, a vegetarian, had the fried green tomato sandwich and loved it.  -Service was terrific! Our server was attentive, funny, and helpful. I was never without water. Great experience there.  -Prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. And our portion sizes were great. I left STUFFED.   Now a few bad, which is the only reason I've taken off one star: -The seating is terribly uncomfortable. We were seated at the communal table with high wooden chairs. The seats of the chairs just aren't quite long enough so they cut me off at mid-thigh, painfully. Also, there is a poured concrete step around the table. I'm thinking this was for you to rest your feet on, but it's not high enough for my legs to reach, so was pointless. I still had to rest my legs on my chair. I am 5'7. Also, the concrete slab makes it impossible to pull your chair all the way in to the table, making me just a bit too far away to sit and eat without having to lean in. Awkward.  -I ordered a microbrew soda, they have a few on the menu, and I was excited to try Dr. Better. It was served to me with the bottle and a glass of ice. Great, except the bottle was warm. Not like only-recently-placed-in-the-refrigerator-to-chill warm. It was HOT like it was sitting in a non-air conditioned storeroom. My friend's soda was also served to him in a warm bottle. It was unfortunate because the flavor of the soda was diluted by pouring it warm over the ice. Why would they not serve it chilled? Do they not have a room for a soda refrigerator? It struck me as strange. And irritating.  -It was really loud in there. The music wasn't loud, but all those folks talking in such a small space made for a noisy noisy dining experience. It was hard to have a conversation between just me, my husband, and our friend. Oh well.   Overall though, we will definitely be back because the food and service was great and there are other things I want to try. I will however try to grin and bear it while sitting on their uncomfortable seats, not bother ordering a soda again, and will forgo conversation and just focus on eating!"}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Great menu with a variety of options for sharing!  We started with the fried chicken skins and charred octopus.  The fried chicken skins were good but not the best I've had, the skins were just a little denser than the ones they served at 595 craft.  The honey with the chicken skins definitely worked though.  The charred octopus was very tender, I just wish there was more octopus and less potatoes.  The aioli that paired with the octopus was a little too lemony for my taste.  We also got the new york strip which was impressive, the coffee flavors and the red wine made a great pairing.  We went to Gordon Ramsay steak the night before....and the NY strip was possibly better than the Wellington there in terms of tenderness of the meat and flavor.  We also got the mushroom flat bread which was executed well but maybe a touch under seasoned for me.  The black rice oxtail risotto and the mac and cheese were also excellent for carb options.  We tried two desserts the bourbon brownie and the bread pudding donut.  The bread pudding donut we couldn't stop eating.  We left behind half of the bourbon brownie, it was more like fudge, so super dense and heavy with bourbon flavor.  Overall, solid meal and I would definitely come back.

The server seemed happy to be at work and proud of the food he was serving us. Then the bill comes out in a vintage book that previous guests have signed. So from first impressions to last impressions, it was consistently a pleasant surprise. The next time I take a visitor downtown, this is where we're going! I can't wait to experience their night time ambiance. I bet it's rad."}

First off, if you didn't know it was there you would have trouble finding this spot, but it's worth the hunt.  As soon as you enter the place you feel as if your transported out of downtown.  Carson's is a small joint, but does well with the space it has.  Lots of bar like seating forces you to engage your fellow patrons in  conversation. The place is very clean and you can see everything from the bar to the cooks prepping your food.  Very cool atmosphere.  The place only went up from there.  Our waitress Tara was absolutely amazing.  Going over the entire menu, telling us what has changed,(Cause they are in the process of changing their  seasonal menus.) to recommend her personal favorites, and occasional checking in on us without being pushy.  Everything a waitress should aspire to be.  Well done Tara.  This food is designed to order several different things, and to be shared amongst your party.  This mite force you to abandon your virtual partner / cell phone and have to participate in conversation which I love. We decided on the Chicken Skins, Gyro Tacos and their Mac and Cheese; with a couple tasty brews to top it off.  All the food was amazing with an abundance of flavor and the perfect portion size. Was defiantly full when I left.  We finished it off with bread pudding that was a good balance of cinnamon, caramel, and vanilla.    With the redo of Downtown if full effect; this place is a perfect addition.  The only downfall is the lack of seating, but if you go during non peak hours you will be fine.  Well done to you Carson's Kitchen you are what is right about a local eatery.  Will be back soon."}

I liked the communal tables.  The host was a good looking guy but seems grumpy.  Didn't smile once while we were looking over the menu.    We usually like the bar so decided to sit there.  It was about 430 and relatively quiet.  You would they would have even more time to be attentive.  Wrong.  The guy behind the bar was busy the whole time stacking glasses and stocking beer.  Felt like we walked in too early and before they opened or something.  He was rushing to get everything done.  He did take our order and our food came out in reasonable time but serving us was more of an afterthought.   This would have been ok if the food lived up to 4 stars and it did not.  Everything was over salted.  We ordered the tempura green beans and oxtail risotto based on good review.  Green beans was ok, crispy but some were salty.  Felt like someone put salt at the end but didn't spread it even. First bite or the oxtail risotto was good.  A burst of flavor and richness.  Unfortunately more bites made us realized it was also over seasoned.   I asked for a slice of bread to eat with it. and he said he had to charge me.  That's okay.  Bread came with butter toasted and also some salt.  Why would you put salt on bread?  Needless to say, we were not impressed and walked away with a salty after taste.  It was a far cry from the Therapy dinner we had last night.  We will not be back."}

I know it's on practically every review here, but if you stop reading this review after this paragraph... get the bacon jam. Seriously. Bacon jam. Bacon jam. Bacon jam. I was hoping it'd appear in front of me.  On our last visit, we had the opportunity to sit at the seats right in front of the kitchen. I was initially a bit apprehensive about being next to the hustle and bustle, but wow. It was a totally unique experience, chatting with the staff about the dishes and watching the synchronicity of a well-managed kitchen. On top of the bacon jam, we had the cauliflower appetizer as well, both of which were delicious (but if you have to choose between these two, get the bacon jam, seriously). For my main course I got the fried chicken sandwich, which was prepared just right. Plus, the tots - delicious!   We'll definitely be back for a fourth visit."}

Dishes were on the pricey side, but I guess still technically under the $$ (two dollar sign) category for Yelp.  Bacon Jam -- 3 stars. It was good, and more than half of our group liked it, but I thought it was only OK. It's like bacon but sweetened into a jam. You can ask for additional bread, but they WILL charge you for the extra bread.  Tempura Green Beans -- 4 stars. Good, but probably not worth the calories.  Crispy Chicken Skins -- 4 stars. Good, but IMO not worth the calories.  Gyro Tacos -- 4 stars. Tasty, but for $11 you get only 3 small tacos.  Baked Mac & Cheese -- 4 stars. Good, super cheesy and creamy, but I would've liked some additional oomph -- would've been 5 stars with some crunchy topping and some bacon!  Donut Bread Pudding -- 5 stars. Delicious and decadent. The donut had a crispy crust that was delightful."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Let me gather my thoughts... It's difficult to paraphrase an explosive experience on a full stomach. Ok I'll start from beginning to end. We got there and parking was difficult, greeter at the door was nice, super packed, 45 minute wait, ordered a beer at the bar, waited in the back courtyard. Now this seems rather unpleasant, but this is where Carson Kitchen 'stepped their game up' and delivered. At the bar they had a Brooklyn Brown Ale that my friends and I enjoy and haven't seen here in the west coast. The court yard in the back was surprisingly serene, reminiscent of times spent in a backyard BBQ with friends. The wait was actually 15 mins which translated to 'freaking awesome' (I like the under-promising and over-delivering). Now, the fifth star was credited to the food and the man behind the magic. Bacon Jam is on point and that is no understatement because I found myself spreading that goodness on everything. No joke. I put it on the Mac n cheese, I put it on the gyro tacos, I put it on the coco steak. Don't get me wrong, all of these dishes lacked nothing and were incredible by themselves, but that bacon jam was like crack for me, and given the means I would've taken it intravenously. I guess one of the chefs came out to check on us and he couldn't have been a more 'cool like dat' kind of guy. Kudos to Eugene the chef, you made that food your bitch and owned it. Not quite sure who the owner is but you get the standing 'O' for nailing the whole ambiance of this place. You seriously got that five star taste without all that pretension of those snotty, over priced, mish-mash, upscale casino restaurants. Most def coming back here and referring it to my friends and family."}

When reiterating that rooftop was preferred, again I felt like she wanted to dissuade us by saying it would be an additional 20 mins to the 30 we already waited. We were willing to wait, then miraculously there was seating available right at that moment... Seating at 4 tables actually.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I wanted to like this place based off of their menu but their seating arrangements and lack of hospitality was thoroughly disappointing.  Tonight a friend of mine suggested we eat here, I've never been.  We arrive and spoke with the hostess.  She tells us for a table of 3 it'll be a 30 minute wait so we went and grabbed a drink at the bar.  As we drank we reviewed the menu.  I hadn't eaten all day and was starving so I've already pre selected several dishes I wanted to try myself.  I had about two appetizers 2 entries and few sides that I wanted to try, plus wine (which I was already having a glass of)  just on my own accord not counting my friend and the rest of our party.  After about 30 minutes or so, the hostess comes back and asks us when the rest of our party would arrive, we said in a few minutes they're running late.  She says if your party isn't here we cannot seat you, because we have a full house.  Even though 1. That disclaimer was not mentioned during the initial waiting period, and 2. Our party was legitimately running late.  Mind you I suggested that since our party is running late.  I will order for 4 so we'd make it worth their time.  When clearly myself alone was already tentatively at over $150 dollar bill.  I understand turning tables quickly, I also understand milking a cash cow as is.  If Ive already suggested ordering for four which means we would've cleared a 200 dollar bill, and had my friend and I only had two in our party but ordered for 4 it's a win win.  They've gotten their money and we would've gotten our food, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived the bill would've doubled, because like myself my friends and I are food fanatics.  The hostess was completely unapologetic for her lack of the disclaimer which still annoys me.  Had she mentioned the fact that our entire party needed to be present obviously we would've coordinated better and had everybody present and not have wasted an entire 30-40 MINUTES, waiting for a BS excuse at the END of our wait time!  It was a bullshit move and I took my money somewhere else.  Despite what looked like an appetizing menu, I won't come back to a place that refuses to serve people because they can't get their seating figured out."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Never have I ever thought of an establishment like this would actually exist at the former John E. Carson Hotel in DTLV!!  Came in on a busy Saturday night with at least 30-minute wait for a table of two.  Luckily, we were able to snag two seats at the bar upstairs which certainly has a better atmosphere than the crammed dining area downstairs.  The rooftop patio has this relaxed and hip ambiance: bistro lighting hanging throughout, awesome music playing in the background and plenty of seating especially for a fairly large group.  Cocktails are rather great in this place.  Forgot his name but the Irish bartender made our experience that much better.  He explained what goes in each libation and even provided few unexpected treats throughout the night.  Out of all the drinks I had, I liked Towns End (Slow & Low Whiskey, Fernet Vittone, Amaro del sole, Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6, Angostura bitters) the most as I usually tend to go for dark liquors.  Asked for a Sazerac next since I was already going towards that route, but unfortunately, no Pernod at this joint!  The bartender, however, decided to make me a drink somewhat suggestive of what the Magarian (Aviation Gin, thyme & honey syrup, fresh lemon, Mr. Q. Cumber Soda) would taste like.  Surprisingly, I didn't mind the transition from dark to light as the smokiness greatly complimented the Crispy Chicken Skin and its smoked honey dipping sauce.  Right when you know I've had enough liquor for the night, I was faced with Brewer's Fix (Hophead Vodka, apricot preserves, fresh lemon, simple syrup, Prosecco) which was amazing due to the fact that a.) it's on the house and b.) I like India Pale Ales.    As far as their dishes, there are plenty of interesting items to choose from.  For this visit, we opted for their shared plates.  If you were only to get one thing from the menu, make sure it's the Crispy Chicken Skins.  Something about a chicharron-like chip dipped in smoked honey sauce is just sublime!  Another favorite was the Veal Meatballs smothered in sherry foie gras cream sauce.  Yes, sherry foie gras cream sauce... it's truly as good as it sounds!!  Also decided to get the Devil's Eggs (topped with crispy pancetta and caviar) and Roasted Young Beets (pistachio, orange and goats cheese).  Still have plenty of room?!  End your meal with the Glazed Doughnut Bread Pudding (three rum caramel and vanilla creme anglaise).  It ain't no sticky toffee but it's a great alternative.  Overall, Carson Kitchen definitely lives up to all the buzz!!  Delicious food, impressive concoctions,  great ambiance and superb customer service.  Can't wait to go back!"}

At  arrival we weren't greeted with a warm welcome. We were seated at a high top that seats about 6-10 people and requested to sit in a lower table. The place was very empty and the host sat us at a vertical two top. When me and my boyfriend requested to sit next to each other at a four top, she mentioned to us she wouldn't be able to seat us there because if there was a large party they would need the table. Take in mind this place was empty. When we sat at the two top, my boyfriend moved along the side and the server rudely told my my boyfriend he couldn't sit next to me! At that point we were so shocked and upset that we just ended up leaving.  First impressions are everything in any business, and this place has the worst hospitality. If their service was that bad, I can only imagine how they handle their food they serve."}

The restaurant was really clean and quiet. The patrons were mostly dressed for dates.   I had the deviled eggs, chicken skins, tacos and a sangria.

But, let's get down to business - everything was so dang good. There was seriously not a mediocre dish on the menu. The wonderfully curated menu is also a product of Nikki B's fantastic tastebuds, so shout out to the bride as well!   *Crispy Chicken Skins (smoked honey): The chicken skins were beautifully crispy and delicious without being oily. The touch of sweetness from the smoked honey was perfect.   *Bacon Jam (baked brie, toasted baguette): Definitely burned my tongue on this dish because I was being hasty and I wanted to try it ASAP. Delicious combination with the sweet and savory bacon jam and creamy  baked brie.   *Tempura Green Beans (pepper jelly cream cheese): The pepper jelly cream cheese reminded the table of pimento! Yum. The green beans were perfectly battered and fried.   *Wild Mushroom Flatbread (basil pistou): I love me some mushroom and I love me some flatbread. I really enjoyed the pickled red onion on this. Helped to add some zing.   *Rainbow Cauliflower (garlic, lemon): Definitely leaned tangy from the lemon, but I enjoyed the palate cleanse.   *New York Strip (cocoa-espresso, red wine demi): PERFECTLY cooked. It was so tender that I didn't even need a steak knife to cut it. Also, cocoa-espresso is some next level Food Network stuff -- meaning I'm too lazy to make it myself at home, but I see it on the time on TV. & now that I have finally tried this combo, I feel like I can't go back to plain ol' salt & pepper!   *Chicken Thighs (mint chimichurri): Very tender! I also loved it with chimichurri. I don't think I've had the combo of chicken & chimichurri before.   *Black Rice Risotto: Yum! Great foundation for all the great protein we had.

I was craving for some desert and ordered the Donut Bread Pudding, and my goodness was that heaven in your mouth. They get the donut from the donut place next door. PLEASE PLEASE get the donut bread pudding its soo good.   Only my 2nd visit to Carson Kitchen, I will always come back. They have really good food and the location is just in Downtown. Cant go wrong with that."}

It was the locals secret and now it's amazingness is NO secret! I  so happy for them but man..... haha! Last nite I took a new transplant to Vegas here and he was blown away. Out wait was less than 30 minutes and got seated at the bar, which is my fave! For a Sunday it was buuuuuuusy! My date is kinda small town and found it so funny to see deviled eggs on the menu! Of course we ordered them and he was just laughing! He loved them! Also had the bacon Brie app and the watermelon salad. All were enjoyed by us both!  All in all this place Never disappoints. It is great food and a fun vibe. I'm so happy that CK has shown us their here to stay!"}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Making it a seasonal tradition to sit down at Carson Kitchen and taste the new menu it was alongside three others that a hot and humid - relatively speaking - night saw the Restaurant half-full, Scott Simon in the kitchen and Matthew Harwell watching over servers that seem to change frequently but never miss a beat.  Still the best reason to be eating downtown even as competition has mounted, Kerry Simon's dream as executed and carried on by Cory Harwell never shy to try new things and challenge diners with big flavors or new ingredients, Summer 2018 sees some twelve new plates join classics such as Chicken Skins, Bacon Jam and other ideas since copped by others elsewhere, the bar program also introducing four new Cocktails from which both the creamy Machu Peach-U and cumbersomely-named but equally complicated Imagining Beaches in Bigfork, MT warrant attention.  Perhaps the biggest wholesale menu change in years, the Trout Rillettes of Spring giving way to a jar of chunky Cheese topped in Peppers that is good but not on par with what The Goodwich is doing by way of their Baa-mento in terms of creaminess or Crackers, it was in follow-up that Pork Wings impressed thanks to crisp cubes that visually look laminated by fat and taste great without being overwhelmingly hot.  Always impressing with Produce, the gastro-pub feel of a place with exposed ceilings and cement floors making this fact all the more noteworthy, it would be difficult to suggest one new Salad over the other if forced to decide between refreshing Plums & Pecorino or Peach Panzenella though the later certainly eats more hearty thanks to housemade Croutons, a personal distaste for Mint unfortunately making Black Kale & Watermelon a distant third place though no one else at the table seemed to enjoy chewing and chewing and chewing to be rewarded by a rare piece of Fruit or Nut either.  Changing up both Flatbreads for the Summer, the Everything idea spreading across the nation from Donuts to Choux to Metro Pizza's off-menu Instagram favorite making Carson Kitchen's enjoyable but less unique, those looking for something truly special would be better off ordering six crisp slices of Mushroom Tikka Masala punched up by Tomatoes marinated with fire, another spicy Veg-friendly dish featuring Snap Peas served like Edamame also recommendable.  Rare to pass up the aforementioned Chicken Skins when dining as a group, a still-iconic dish at any time during the feast, fans of Chicken who've somehow had enough of Cory's Secret Sunday Sandwich should be thrilled to see boneless Thighs brought back with Alabama-style Sauce, each bite developing in waves with a creamy Citrus finish while the Upstate New York icon of Lamb Spiedies unfortunately sees Protein buried and indistinguishable beneath too many of Chicago's famous pickled Vegetables.  Rounding out savories with Red Radish, another smart Farm & Garden dish that follows the semi-sweet line of thinking from Winter's Caramel Creamed Corn, it was once again that Dinner at Carson Kitchen had to end with the best Brownie in Sin City, but not before also enjoying the fresh and fruity Peach Upside-Down Cake that eats far lighter than most might imagine.  ****1/2:  Taking on immense flavors and reinterpreting some classic dishes Summer at Carson Kitchen falls a bit short at times by being too aggressive, though as usual the vast majority of plates both new and old set a high standard while service and setting are hip yet comfortable...save for those backless metal stools."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "You should come here if you have 2 of 2 things while you're in Vegas (you will need both):  1) Mobility- take a car and drive yourself here. My friend and I spent $30 on cab fare trying to get to downtown Las Vegas with the possibility of not catching a cab ride back because cabs are not plentiful in downtown.  2) Intestinal fortitude- downtown Las Vegas is not for the faint of heart. The crowd is...eclectic which is a rather nice adjective to use. There are a lot of drunk, aggressive people in the downtown area if you happen to take a peep into the downtown strip after dining at Carson Kitchen, beware. I'm usually alright, but I was slightly uncomfortable because it was out of my element.   With that said, Carson Kitchen was great. I had a great meal here. I hope it garners more press and popularity because what the staff is putting out is nothing short but amazing.  My friend and I ordered the following:  -crispy chicken skin with smoked honey: deep fried pieces of chicken skin, lightly sprinkled with a powdery chili and dipped into a smoked honey. This was a winning combination. The texture of the chicken skin was spot on- not too hard with the right amount of crisp. I really enjoyed this dish. I do wish that the skin pieces were slightly smaller, but overall, this was excellent.  -devil's eggs: deviled eggs topped with pancetta and caviar. The addition of fried bits of pancetta was excellent. It really balanced the soft texture of the deviled egg by giving it an extra crunch. There were also generous heaps of caviar on each egg. Wonderful.  -cocoa expresso New York strip steak: medium rare steak topped with a red wine demi. The steak was flavorful, had the right amount of chew, and perfect to the palette. This was surprisingly so good. I do wish that they were more sparing with the red wine demi because the sauce really added another dimension to the steak. Great overall main dish.  We also ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes to pair with our steak. This was a great addition because the potatoes came generously heaped with garlic. It was a winning steak and potato combination.  It's only been recent that I have ventured outside of the strip in search of food, and if you have the willingness to do so, you can find find gems like Carson Kitchen hidden in Vegas. Do yourself a favor- if you are searching for one really great meal in Vegas, make your way off the strip and into Carson Kitchen. It's a good bang for your buck ($27 per person including all of the dishes), and it helps keep the food scene in Vegas alive."}

They put so much love and effort into everything they make. At first, I was a little turned off by the seating. I felt like I was in the kitchen, but very quickly realized we had the best spot in the house.   I had 2 of their hand crafted cocktails, both we're on point! They had an excellent craft beer list (I work in the industry and that means something to me) my husband was only able to drink 1 beer, because we filled up on food.  I suggest the green beans and BBQ burned ends, those were my favorites. We ordered 5 items off the menu, nothing disappointed. I feel like you can't go wrong. Then there was dessert.... the bourbon brownie was amazing. Homemade ice cream was the best I've ever had!  At the end of our meal Micheal asked us how everything was? We told him how impressed we were and that we will make it a point to stop in every time we visit the city."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I'm going to say this. I will come back in a couple of weeks to see how things are going. But first, let me praise the staff to the high heavens. Unlike a lot of new places downtown they don't assume you're going to just drink the koolaid. They were ernest in their desire to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our food. They seemed to have actually tasted most of the food and had good recommendations for us. Much like La Comida, I'd eat here again regardless of what I thought of the food because the staff made the experience worthwhile. Fyi, I don't care for the food at La Comida.   The food. Well. We split oxtail risotto which, honestly, was so rich as to be offputting. I ate maybe four spoonfuls as did my lunch date. There was plenty left to take home but we passed. We also had the bacon jam with brie. It was actually delish, but again, a little went a long way. A very long way. Again, we passed on taking the extra home. The empanadas were filled with nice chunky meat that was tender though it could've been a tad juicier. The mushroom flatbread was a great appetizer and the pizza cook was lots of fun without being overly familiar.  Here's my issue and it's something you can actually see in the accompanying picture. The risotto and jam seemed to be swimming in something. It wasn't grease. Maybe some oil like truffle? The lake of whatever it was did not inspire one to want to deal with that in a to go box or when it inevitably congealed. Again, offputting is the only word I can find to describe my feelings about it. It really wasn't greasy or slimy, but it looks that way. Combined with the fact that everything (except the empanadas) was just way too rich means I won't be pushing this as a place to go. Not yet.   I'm sure that Carson Kitchen will find it's feet very soon, and hope so. I like the vibe even if the decor looks like someone went to EAT and decided that's the new downtown Vegas hip eatery look. Seriously, it almost looks like a blatant rip off. They seemed to be working on an outside patio which in and of itself will get me back this summer. And, not to be petty, I give it points for being filled with adults, not a bunch of bearded wannabes.   The pricing seemed a tad ambitious. For small plates you can go from a quick bite to a $50 lunch in no time. Not outrageous but probably not in my, let's run by for a nosh, price range.  I look forward to sampling more of Carson Kitchen soon but I'm hoping they bring the ooze down a notch. Go check it out for yourself, it's worth a try. Good luck Carson Kitchen, welcome downtown!"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "As a foodie, I'd say the food here is good.  The staff was friendly but the seating was odd.  The only reason Carson's doesn't get 5 stars from me is because ALL of our food came out at different times, including my friend's a la carte veggies she ordered with her fish.  The server told us that everything comes comes out when ready and we should plan to share as it does.  I thought this odd but by then we were committed. It was her cauliflower, her fish, her husband's sandwich and some time later my turkey burger. I watched them eat most of their food and then they got to watch me eat mine (we did share some, but we wanted what we wanted).  So, I don't know if this is the general practice there or we just look like a bunch of schmucks but Carson's, your kitchen really ought to figure out how to time it so food is ready together.  Every other restaurant and home kitchens can do it, so can you.  Seriously."}

Started off with a few of the shareable plates. If you don't care about your waist line or your cholesterol levels, start with the crispy chicken skins. They have taken the best part of fried chicken and made it an appetizer!  The Wellington empanadas are amazing!  The beef inside is so flavorful and tender.  Next we had the tempura green beans. The beans were so fresh and the tempura was the perfect crispiness/saltiness. Don't forget to dip in the cream cheese sauce. Next was the veal meatballs with sherry foie gras cream sauce. Again heaven. Taking down home comfort food and jazzing it up a notch. Did I mention we sat at the chefs counter and were able to talk to the entire kitchen staff while they prepared our meal!  It was like being on a cooking show. For our main course, we had the short rib sliders and the baked Mac and cheese. Again amazing comfort food taken to the next level. The short ribs have a root beer glaze that is a perfect compliment to the braised beef. I've been dying to try the Mac and cheese since the day I saw a pic of them on FB a few months ago and it was so worth the wait!   As stuffed as we were, we still tried the Bourbon Fudge Brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream. And we were so happy we did. The ice cream had actual bacon bits in it!  Paired with the decadent chocolate brownie, the saltiness/creaminess of the ice cream was what God must have intended heaven to taste like :)  I will definitely be coming back with lots of my friends in tow!"}

The style of serving is more of a social, sharing type experience, which we loved but may not be for everyone.   Bacon Jam = life changer. Get it. You won't regret it. Steak was amazing as well.

We also tried the bacon jam, which was a little to sweet for me (I was picturing more smoky/salty), but it was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone at our table. Our meal was DELISH, and the service was perfect. Make sure to try the Rainbow Cauliflower, and the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding.  I had the Bourbon Brownie and Browned Butter Bacon ice cream.  The brownie had the texture of a chocolate bar, rather than a brownie, and the bourbon was truly present - almost overwhelming, but the ice cream was great.

From the start, we are greeted cheerfully by the hostess, and quickly sat at the bar with a kitchen view. I don't know about you, but I love to cook and watching them prep is relaxing to me. Our wait staff took our drink orders promptly, and served our drinks quickly as well.   Our first item was called Crispy Chicken skins with smoked honey. One word for this dish: phenomenal. My friend and I were gobbling up this dish when our second food arrived. It's called Barbecue Burnt End Tri tips. I was still on the skins when my best friend Will told me I have to try the second dish. So I did. I thought the skins were great, but compared to the tri tips, it paled in comparison. The tri tips were just excellent. The second dish were getting murdered like there was no tomorrow. That's when our third dish came, and it was called Bacon Jam with Brie. Now, I've tried other bacon jams, and the mix was either too much bacon (even though there's no such thing as too much bacon), or too much jam. The Bacon Jam at Carson Kitchen are in perfect harmony. The split between the two are perfect. Matched with baked brie elevates the flavor even more.  Now, the food were excellent but it wasn't just about the food. The staff were on top of their game as well. The wait staff and management were checking in on us, but not in an annoying kinda way. They checked on us in opportune time, not when we are midbite on our food. Hahaha!   The greatest kudos goes to the Wait staff especially Chef Brandon. Here's the thing, most kitchen staff are busy with prep work and cooking. Even though the kitchen was busy, they still took time out to interact with us, and that really made the experience great.  Chef Brandon, you can tell he's busy but he still takes time to talk to us. Now, even though he's busy and talking to us, his priority was still cooking the entrees so all the other customers weren't waiting long times for their orders. Now, that's service.   The only regret that I have is that we were only there for a small amount of time and only got to experience the appetizers. If the appetizers were that great, I can NOT wait to try the entrees.   I would DEFINITELY come back for the appetizers, and would DEFINITELY take my time and experience their entrees. I definitely recommend Carson Kitchen to everyone. That includes family, friends, and people I don't know. It is THAT great."}

It's a small space, but always busy and active.  Lively conversation, but not too loud.  There is a great outdoor patio and an upstairs bar.  The venue is first-rate.  As far as food goes, there is nothing on the menu that isn't amazing.  I've had the Burnt Ends, Devils Eggs and Gyro Tacos.  And I've had the Strip Steak, the Pork Chop and salad.  I could elaborate on these items, but words don't do them justice.  They are phenomenal.  Mac and Cheese....heaven on earth.  Olive Oil potatoes....wow.  Cauliflower...awesome.  Yes, there is a theme here.  Nothing has disappointed.  The staff understands how to run a very busy, popular restaurant.  They are friendly, efficient and really helpful.  Having trouble with what to order?   Just ask someone to help.  I'd swear that everyone has worked here for years, because they are familiar with the menu and no one is shy about offering recommendations.  They also get along and work as a team, which says a lot about the management team.  Finally, a huge shout-out to Stacy and Michael for making tonight's visit the even better than the last two.  I am a local and this is officially my go-to place Downtown!"}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This quaint little restaurant is off the beaten path from old downtown Fremont Street. Finding it isn't hard IF you're looking; it's named for the street it's on. But there's not much around to use for landmarks. It's across the street from an empty lot. And while there's not much around to look at, there is a simple charm to the rooftop dining area on a cool winter night in Las Vegas.  The staff is friendly and identified by the band tee shirts they're required to wear. Our waitress was honest about food selections and steered us away from the root beer glazed short rib. She did make a mistake with regard to our drink order, but we ended up with a free beer, so I cannot complain.  The food is rustic small plate style and meant to be shared. There were three of us so we sampled a few items.  The bacon jam we agreed was by far the star attraction. It's rich and flavorful and even though you feel guilty, you'll have trouble sharing. The Devil's eggs were also quite good, but gone in a flash. As far as the larger items, the butter burger was actually quite good. It comes with tater tots, which were decent, but it's hard to mess up tater tots. The Mac and Cheese was rich and creamy but neither mind blowing or disappointing. The mushroom flatbread was, however disappointing, and so was the risotto. The flatbread uninspired, small, and distinctly missing any rich flavors. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the oxtail risotto was so overpowered with parmesan cheese there wasn't room for any other flavors.   We drank our desert. The beer selection is actually fairly good and non-traditional. I tried two of the mixed drinks and each was well prepared.  A nice touch at the end of the meal is how the check arrives; in a book which invites you to leave an autograph and a message.   Taking all into account, I think I'll try this kitchen again at least once more for the bacon jam. I did take some points away for location as well as for taste. However three stars as a rating comes because, as one of my friends said, I think the owner's believe their food is out of the park when some of it needs improvement."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "This place was great! Given all the wonderful reviews, we were really expecting it to be awesome! It didn't disappoint, for the most part.   The inside is small but fun, and has a good atmosphere. It's loud and lively. Seems like a fun downtown place. Had I known about the patio when I made the reservations, we would have definitely been up there! So fun!  The waiter was great - friendly and attentive, but not too much.   For food, plates are smaller- like tapas style, and they make for a great date/small party. They suggest that you share, but it's basically forced sharing as everyone's food comes out at different times. We had a large group and the first persons dish to the last was nearly 25 minutes. Sharing ended up being fine but if you're not a sharer or are with people you don't really want digging into your food, maybe go elsewhere that night. It's a little pricey for the small portions, but that's the in thing.  We ordered: Pork Osso Buco - Definitely tender... fall of the bone but it was lacking flavor. I'd skip it.  Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto - My husband ordered this and ate every last bite, so I'd say it was good.  Chicken Skins - These are spicy! Spicy enough I couldn't eat them. The sauce is interesting too. Good if you like liquid smoke.  Mac and Cheese - Was good! Gyro Tacos - I'd probably order only this if we ever go back.   The drinks were great - I got sangria and it was like juice. I think I knocked back 3 before I told the waiter no more!  It's kid friendly, but be aware that they don't have high chairs.  Definitely fun for drinks/apps. Treat it like that instead of a restaurant. and Sit outside!"}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "During a recent trip to Las Vegas, we visited this place on recommendation of one of the foodies in our group, and it really delivered! The place isn't much to look at from the outside, but it's warm and comfortable inside. Although they have a nice beverage program, our group of about eight focused primarily on food during this visit. We primarily focused on sharing small plates, so the Social Plates section of the menu was drawn upon heavily. Here's what we had:  Crispy chicken skins - Crispy and delicious, they had a nice flavor and texture without being overly greasy. Accompanying smoked honey was an absolute knockout, and lent a bit of a chicken and waffles flavor to the dish.   BBQ burnt ends - Tender bits of beef with a nice, slightly spicy and sweet sauce, these were a hit across the board. The side of pickles were a bit too raw (i.e. too close to cucumber) for me, but other diners loved them.   Onion rings - An off menu delight, these substantial rounds of fresh onion were perfectly breaded and fried, nicely seasoned and served simply with ketchup. We ended up knocking off two, maybe three orders of these.   Gyro Tacos - These were presented very close to the classic Mexico City street taco style, and the lamb was mild, making for a very nice fusion dish. Feta was properly crumbly and not overpowering, and tzaziki had a nice cucumber crunch.   Pig in a duvet - Kind of a fancy pig in blanket, this featured an upscale and spicy chorizo on the inside, and a very nice breading wrapped around it. Spicy mustard made a great presentation as well as a good flavor contrast.   Tempura green beans - A perfectly light, crispy tempura over fresh green beans, these were made fantastic with pepper jelly cream cheese, something I wouldn't have thought would have worked, but it did.   Hobo stew - This was like a thick gumbo, and while it had most of the right ingredients, including shrimp and a nice andouille sausage, it fell a little flat in terms of overall flavor and experience.   Rainbow cauliflower - Finished fairly simply with garlic and lemon juice, this dish was tasty, but could have been better with more browning on the florets. The texture was a little mushy for my taste, but flavorwise, it was very nice.   Finally, we decided that something sweet was in order, and since we had a good sized party, we just went with one of each of the three offerings:  Bourbon fudge brownie - Deep, rich chocolate flavor with a definite bourbon note, combined with a tender, almost creamy texture made this one very popular at the table, but the brownie wasn't even the best part. The stunning brown butter bacon ice cream might have been one of the best ice creams I've ever tasted, anywhere. Simply fantastic.   Honey cheesecake - Served with a strawberry liqueur coulis as well as slices of dried strawberry, this was an above average cheesecake with a nice shortbread crust. It was also pretty sizable, so be prepared to share if you get this one.    Glazed donut bread pudding - Saving the best for last, the bread pudding lovers among us (myself included) simply could not get enough of this absolutely amazing dish. The rum caramel sauce and vanilla creme anglaise were delicious but potent, and worked better when applied sparingly, but the pudding itself was soft, just the right amount of sweet, and perfectly warm, with nice browning on the outside and a creamy inside. If you only get one dessert, this is probably the one to get. Well, then there's that ice cream from the other one...  Bottom line: This place was absolutely awesome, and is a very fitting venue to be reviewed for this, my 1,000th review on Yelp. Yes, it's way off the beaten path, but if you love good food, this should be a planned destination if you're in Vegas. Incredibly, even the price was right, with all of the above coming out to only a bit over $30 per person. Just, come here and try it!"}

The Salmon with Spinach Pistou and charred lemon. This was off the charts good and I want to commend the cook for NOT over cooking our salmon!! It was cooked perfectly.

The kitchen staff & waitstaff have a tightly run ship that runs smoothly. My partner & I were lucky to be seated by the kitchen & witness the beautifully efficient system they have in place, getting food to patrons in a timely manner. We were very impressed. Despite the place being packed & busy, the kitchen manager stayed on top of orders and made sure that everyone had food at their table within a reasonable amount of time and even managed to make friendly conversation with us in between orders. Our waitress was super friendly & helpful as well. She informed us ahead of time that food comes out as it's ready (not all at once) & dishes are intended to be shared. My kind of dining! Our food came to us at a steady pace.   We also asked our waitress for recommendations & she did not steer us wrong!   She suggested the Baked Mac & Cheese. Sounds like a pretty basic dish & I was reluctant but I'm sure glad we got it! It was soooo good. Not sure what kind of magical cheese they use, but it was delicious & it had truffle oil, which makes any simple food decadent. Great spin on a classic. And the baked bread crumbs sprinkled on top added a nice balance of crunch to the creamy gooey goodness.   The Roasted Young Beets with pistachios, orange, & goat cheese was an amazing combination of flavors. Very light & refreshing.   The Steelhead Trout with almond relish & creamed kale was also fantastic. The skin was crisp to perfection & the flesh was moist. No clue how they do that. I can't recall eating a more perfectly cooked fish.   Great to have had a positive experience during our stay in Vegas."}

Bringing in the talents of John Courtney since our last visit, the familiar Vegas face now assisting Cory in menu development as the restaurant group eyes local expansion with the upcoming Standard & Pour, it was entirely at the culinary team's discretion that courses were rolled out from the cozy hard-working kitchen and beginning with a tribute to Kerry Simon the charred edamame may not seem quite as novel as they once were, but nonetheless signify an important moment in the restaurant's history, a reminiscent piece that would be even more interesting should they continue to flash back with additional classics of the Rock n' Roll Chef as the years march forth.  Onward next to two new salads, Carson Kitchen's rich Bacon Jam with Brie making an appearance just in case we thought the course too light, Harwell again looks to introduce novel ingredients in interesting ways with a Greek Salad anchored by toothsome farro and quinoa, the yogurt not quite tangy enough to balance the plate's substantial nuttiness, a far more elegant flavor profile spanning the Blood Orange & Root that saw bright acid alongside hearty salsify, parsnip, and celery root with a slight sweetness lingering at the end.  Next presenting two new flatbreads it was much like the past that results were a bit hit and miss, for as good as the Wild Mushroom version was at bringing mustiness in check with creamy squash and pickled radish the Pear & Bleu was really only interesting for the craisins plumped by flavors of a negroni, the charred sprouts suffocating any sweetness from thinly sliced pears and almost so bitter as to overwhelm the punchy cheese as well.  Acknowledging my personal bias against Spam, the salty processed meat holding neither nostalgic nor hipster value when a world of charcuterie is available to be explored, I'll simply say that Carson Kitchen's current sliders are better than most presentations, though money is still better invested in any of the restaurant's other sandwiches, the Sunday Chicken somehow a glaring omission in items tasted on past visits but an upgrade in all ways over the Chick-fil-a version on which it is based.  Still smiling about the pickle relish it was again Brussel Sprouts that were brought to our table and although put to far better use in whole form alongside tender wrinkly potatoes and the flavors of allspice only a small sample was necessary from a dish intended for sharing, particularly as the crispy skinned trout over creamed kale is the sort of plate one is likely to covet for themselves.  No doubt trending heavier than last menu, the winter theme evident even in a city where snow is less common than an honest Hotel Public Relations Department, concluding savories consisted of Cory's hefty pot pie placing chicken, turkey, and intentionally prominent duck in a rich gravy beneath crumbled buttermilk biscuits, the Shepard's 3.14 a collaborative effort between he and Courtney that lightens up the British meat and potatoes staple with tender dumplings and plenty of vegetables alongside supple lamb in natural jus.  Ending the meal with two orders of Banoffee Pie, the dish *supposedly* brought back just for me, fans of the traditional version will be happy to know that the flavors of Banana and Toffee are equally present and poignant beneath a cloud of Bailey's whipped cream in a full-size mason jar and although a retread from the past still a truly delicious treat that, if rumors are true, should see Las Vegans offering me their thanks."}

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.  I. Ordering Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 Butter Burgers - boursin, cheddar, lettuce, tomato ($14). We ordered it medium rare and it comes with spicy tater tots. We also ordered some of their cocktails.   II. The burgers The burger had too much cheese! It comes with boursin and 2 slices of cheddar, which wasn't melty (sad). It was overpowering. Trevor and I both took out one of the slices of cheddar. The patties were cooked perfectly and were nice, thick, and juicy. They had a great sear and were seasoned well. The bun was nice and gooey, but were a little too big for the burger patty. The burgers also had a crazy thick slice of tomato. The lettuce was on the bottom of the burger, which did a good job of catching the juice from the patty and keeping it in the burger = very good burger construction. What struck us most was how well balanced this burger was. All the flavors really worked well together.  III. The tots The tots were good. They were well fried and had a nice spice to them. They had lots of herbs!  IV. Miscellaneous This place is in downtown Las Vegas so parking can be a bit tricky. It's really cute inside and has a great vibe. We had to wait for a table, but they have this cool courtyard out back that has a firepit and lots of seating to make waiting comfortable. The drinks were really good. My daaaaaaaaaammmmn, Daniel! was particularly refreshing! Caleigh, our waitress was really great. She was funny, attentive, and just wonderful. She explained to us that they encourage sharing here and that all food comes out when it's ready.   V. Value The value is pretty average for this type of burger. It's more of a gourmet burger and the price matches the taste and quality of ingredients.  VI. The verdict We really enjoyed this burger despite being incredible full (some of us had a buffet earlier and we all ate at Heart Attack Grill only 15 minutes before). That really says something about the quality of this burger. The ratings: 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4.  Next burger crew meeting: May 21, 2016 @ 10:30am at Mon Ami Gabi. Vegas, baby!"}

You might also want to pair it with the mac n' cheese that they have. How about this, try putting bacon jam on top of your mac n' cheese and BOOM. This equals heaven. When it comes to drinks, I like drinking light so I had their sangria. It was perfection."}

Before looking at the beverage menu I immediately pulled out my phone to boomerang the $hit out of the cooks. It's like live theatre folks! Our server was super friendly and attentive. Made jokes with us, kept us engaged, and made all kinds of recommendations to me since it was my first time there.   I ordered the Apricot Cider and we started with the Chicken Skins. They are served with a spicy honey that made me feel like a kid again, but with that grown up vibe. I seriously loved chicken nuggets with honey when I was growing up.   My friend and I split the Buddy Burger, cooked medium rare, and the Roasted Rainbow Cauliflower. Yum.com!!! It was pretty enough to take a picture, which I did! The burger was juicy and fabulous, cooked perfectly, and those tater tots with spicy ketchup? Am I in Narnia?  This is definitely a date night spot, or in my case, a special lady date spot with one of my besties. The menu plucks my belly strings and I can't wait to come back for more."}

We also ordered pig and fig flatbread which was not quite as life altering as the other two.  It wasn't bad, but after the tasting the appetizers, I was expecting more and this was a tad disappointing.  I can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu."}

I said we were waiting for a table and he looked at me like I was crazy and said, well what do you want? If you want a table we only have two tables for two and the wait is 90 minutes. He was kind of exasperated with me even thinking we'd get a table.  He was (my perception) very abrasive. We were hungry so we sat at the bar which was so loud I couldn't hear my boyfriend unless we were shouting. Music was loud the bar was crowded. And he sat us right near the register when all bar seats were empty and people were bumping my boyfriend and the noise! But after being treated like a child the first time i asked a question we went along. After 5 minutes we gave our apologies to the very nice female bartender and left. Just be sure to ask for a TABLE, if you want a nice relaxing dinner. We headed to the aptly called restaurant Therapy which I felt I needed."}

It had been a while since I had visited when I wrote my last review, as pointed out to me by the manager, and I thought it would be only right to come back.  So I did. This time I brought a colleague in tow (it was my treat).  We ordered the lamb tacos, and some spicy shrimp diablo, that was really delicious.  The lamb was flavorful, but just a tiny bit stringy.  The fried chicken skins were a little gummy, but the sauce was excellent.  The beet salad was absolutely 100% perfect. I liked the chocolate dessert, but it was bit too dense and cloying.  The other one (which I'm not remembering right now), was a bit better.  The seating is mostly at high tops, which I'm not a fan of, and music was way too loud to enjoy a proper power lunch with business chums.  Service was a bit affected.  It was fine.  It was fun.  I think the food more properly is 4 stars, on more reflection.  But I still give the overall experience a 3.  It's not an average experience to be sure, but for me, personally, I am not a super fan.  I do appreciate the concept, and I have more respect for the serious investment of commitment and artistry in making food like this, and in operating a restaurant like this.

I'm vegan and wish there was more on the menu. Everyone else seemed to like the food a lot... The bacon jam was a hit for the table and the burgers looked interesting. The service was a little slow.

Sat at the bar and had a microbrew root beer while looking over the menu (too early for me to start on the non-root  beer!) The staff was friendly and when I asked for a recommendation that I could sink my teeth into they offered up the NY Strip Steak. I was looking for some comfort food as as a side-dish so I also ordered the Baked Mac & Cheese.  You ever have a meal that after the first bite you get sad because it's so good and you realize that at some point it's going to be all gone? This was one of those meals! I enjoyed and savored every bite because I knew at some point my food would be all gone and and I'd have to come back down to reality!  The only downside was it would be nice if the steak came with a side. I was by myself so it cost more than I was planning to spend on lunch.

I have to tell you though we went today at lunch and I think we were exceedingly lucky that we walked in and were able to sit at a table. There was one table that was being saved for somebody with reservations and everything else was literally full it is a tiny little spot. But it is fantastic. We started with the Wellington empanadas which was fantastic.  We then ordered the fried green tomato sandwich with crab and the short rib sliders both came with spicy tater tots. The tater tots were not too spicy you could definitely detect some Paprika and they were quite good. The short rib sliders were quite sweet. The menu does say that they are root beer short rib sliders so take note of that because they are sweet. But the slider was fantastic the sweetness was offset by a crispy onion that was put on the slider. If I had one note it would be to put a little bit more crispy onion to offset that sweetness. The fried green tomato sandwich with crab was the star the tomato is very thickly cut and expertly breaded. The breading has a nice spice to it. Overall it was a fantastic meal it's a little pricey for lunch but I think you have to look at what you get and then you understand the $40 price tag for two people at lunch.  I would love to go back, I hope I get lucky again and get a table!!!"}

Mac n Cheese well worth it. Beets - a very tasty unexpected surprise. Did I mention the staff was great? Negatives: Veal meatballs were on the bland side. Expected more from the crispy chicken skins. Thoughts the prices were a little high for amount of food received.  Will I return, definitely.

The mac and cheese melts in your mouth... But the shrimp.... it was THEE best shrimp I ever had in my life. I think it changed my life for the better lol. The bacon jam was such an original dish I have to rank it high. I never tasted anything like it before. My favorite was the tempura style green beans. There was a woman at the bar chocking and a guy ran from the kitchen and saved her life. It was the most excitement that occurred for me during my stay in Vegas lol.

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "OMG!!!!  Best food I've had since moving to CA 2.5 years ago. Let me explain- I moved from Austin Tx (which by the way has amazing New American restaurants, not just BBQ) to San Diego CA. I'm passing thru LV on the way to ski in Alta UT and need a lunch break. Yelped and came up with Carson Kitchen. Got there on a Wednesday  right as they opened at 11am. Good thing as they were full by 1145.  Amazing prompt service, super friendly staff.  Had the bacon jam ($12) smokey, sweet and with a spicy kick served with a little melted Brie and grilled baguette.  Saved some to try with other items.  Next came the Mac and cheese($12). Creamy perfection with a slight hint of truffle.  Great too with a tiny bit of bacon jam. Then the espresso NY strip($18). Perfectly cooked and so tender that I cut it with my butter knife. Again, even better with a tiny bit of bacon jam. Can you tell that the jam is amazing?  Everything is made to be shared, so two or three dishes were more than enough for lunch between the two of us. But then we couldn't pass up the Donut Bread pudding. ($8).  Oh wow!!! Crumbled Donuts mixed with butter and stuffed in a mason jar and baked until brown and yummy on the outside then served with a light buttery rum sauce and creme anglaise.  Perfect finish, though I am now stuffed.   Very good wine list by glass or bottle ($7-10/glass) and great selection of microbrews by the bottle (most from CA-$5-10).  Nice little original cocktail list.  I tried a Standing 8 Count as I don't like sweet stuff.  It says it's made with tequila but it was so smooth that I didn't get a hint of tequila taste until the end. Barely sweet with hint of chocolate bitters, mint leaf and hint of lime.  Seats 48 people during day and at night when upstairs patio is open seats an additional 43. I'll be back on my way back from Utah. Lunch and dinner menu are identical and same prices. Lots of locals there at lunch."}

The Roasted Young Beets with goat cheese and orange slices was interesting and good. The Rabbit Ragu wasn't so great. Although alright, I couldn't taste any rabbit flavor over the spiciness of the sauce. And the duck in the Duck Confit Flatbread was tasty.  The service is top-notch, but also a bit pandering with their, You've made some excellent choices. I'd like to think that if I ordered ANYTHING from their menu it would be an excellent choice.

Located right next to Downtown Fremont, this is a must stop from now on if I'm coming downtown.    1.  Everything on the menu is under $20, including the NY Strip which was cooked perfectly.  2.  Ambience level 1000.  The dining area is small, but with chairs lined around the kitchen and bar it works really well.   Small open room where you can see everything going on.  Very hipster atmosphere, I loved sipping on my Towns End near fire pit out back while we waited for our table.  3.  All of the food we sampled was amazing.  The restaurant encourages family style dining, so we ordered several things off the menu and let the entire table sample a little of everything.  Definitely the way to go here.    4.  Extremely well mixed and delicious cocktail creations.  The cocktails are a bit pricey at $10-$13 but worth it.  Everything I tried was really refreshing and tasted amazing, really can't wait to come back and try everything I didn't have on my first visit.   A couple of the highlights for me were the Fried Chicken Skins and Honey, the perfect balance of sweet and salty.  I was really impressed by the Fish Fillet sandwich also, so goooood!!

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "The place was a little small, but that is to be expected in this part of town.  I think because of the threat of rain, the upstairs patio section was closed, making the dining room really crowded.  I wasn't expecting the whole family style seating.  They don't take reservations so we called ahead to put our name on the list, as the hostess recommended.  We were seated about 10 minutes after arrival on a Saturday night, so that was pretty good.  It was really too crowded to wait inside.  While waiting outside, a dude kept walking up and down the street crazily shouting profanities at nobody, so that added some color to that part of the evening.  Again, this is sort of to be expected in this part of town.    When we were seated, it was at the bar.  I wasn't expecting this but we thought it was fun.  If you are seated at the bar, be prepared for people ordering drinks over your head and handing over payments next to your food.  The bar tender was also our server, so there wasn't much discussion of the menu, just you guys want food?.  He was very nice and good at his job, but between the noise level and him trying to make drinks for the entire restaurant, I didn't really feel able to ask any questions about the menu. (I did have some, but oh well)  On to the food......Awesome!!  I had the killer shrimp, which were nice and spicy along with the pork belly cuban.  I thought the cuban was a little heavy on the yellow mustard, along with the pickles giving it a sort of McDonald's Cheeseburger flavor profile.  But, it would have been the best McD's burger of my life....so there you go.  Also, it came with really good house made tater tots.  I probably wouldn't order this dish again, but I don't regret getting it.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside.  Hubby got the strawberry manchego salad and the garlic fingerling potatoes (he's a vegetarian).  Both were really great.  It was a really nice meal and I really enjoyed my house berry sangria.  It wasn't the same old sangria with oranges and cheap fruit.  It was nice and bright tasting with fresh berries in the glass.  Hubs got some gin concoction with cucumber and thyme.  I thought it was awfully bitter, but that's right up his alley and he really loved it.    The food is definitely 5 star quality, but I knocked off a star just for the whole over crowded feel of the place and not having a real server.  For that price, it would be nice to have had a table and someone to talk to about the food before ordering.  Also, when you're waiting to be seated, they offer you the option of getting a drink at the bar while you wait..........except, the bar is actually table seating, so if you were to lean over people eating and shout a drink order, there is no where to actually enjoy said drink.  Kind of a turn off.    This place is worth the visit, just know what you're getting into before arrival."}

The restaurant recently reopened after a two week renovation/remodel. We were lucky to be seated at the end of the large, granite kitchen table.

It was all so food that we ended up splitting everything we ordered so we could have a taste of everything. My only regret is we didn't go back before we left the next day."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "This review is for the Black Rice Oxtail Risotto. Gremolata was served on top of the risotto. This was not mentioned on the menu description, and it should be as it was fantastic. On my initial bite, I honestly didn't know what to make of it. However, the more I ate and (as a fellow patron encouraged) mixed the gremolata with the rice I really enjoyed it! It's not quite as creamy as a typical risotto as black rice does not cook as glutinous as other rice varieties. It is very flavorful and rich and the gremolata really cuts into the dish and adds another dimension in flavor. The reason I'm docking a star is because my plate did not have very much oxtail. This is a pet peeve of mine and it's happened twice with oxtail being mentioned as a main ingredient to a dish. If it's part of the description, it should be showcased generously. I would definitely come again for this dish and it's one that I will be thinking about for awhile.  Service was friendly and large communal seating around the bar was interesting. Decor was very tasteful and thoughtful considering the tight space."}

Fortunately, we were there late enough that it was not a problem to move me away from the bugs.    - 10 stars for the Crickets.

Each time ive come here the service has been spot on, as well as the quality of food. Sitting at the bar area in front of the kitchen is quite a spectacle if you are not in the food service industry.

I ordered the Mac & cheese, jerk turkey burger, and glazed donut bread pudding. The Mac & cheese was the best macaroni I have had in a very long time. The noodles were still al dente even though they were sitting in a creamy sauce and baked in the oven. Flavor was bold and I enjoyed the bread crumbs on the top, however they were only on half of the dish. When I tasted the burger all I could taste was the potent star anise spice. Burger had potential but the spice ratios need to be toned down. I barely touched the side of tater tots because they were too greasy. I thought the dessert was decadent and very moist for a bread pudding."}

This place was inconspicuously located a couple of blocks from the Freemont experience in downtown Vegas. This place is hip and they have 2 floors (inside and upstairs patio) so on a Wednesday night, we did not wait to be seated. Our server who was the bartender was super excited and energetic. She was helpful in letting us know her faves and customer favorites popular dishes. The food came out as it was made without regards to the order ( apps, main dish, sides, etc). They make and serve the food super fast! The price is fair per dish.   Bacon jam $13: MUST HAVE on everything. Put it on the baguette, Mac and cheese, meats, drinks, desserts, I said EVERYTHING! So deliciously sweet and salty and rich!  Gyro taco $12: it comes with 3 tacos filled with lamb taco meat. Delish!  Devil's eggs: it came with 4 eggs with caviar and bacon on top. The bacon was such a great addition as it was super crispy with the perfect amount of salt. Another great dish.   Lamb chop: great flavor and tender wrapped in Parmesan crust. It came with 2 chops. Definitely perfect for sharing.   Cocoa espresso NY steak: wow! Marinated and tender to perfection! It's so flavorful that even though I was full to my eyeballs, I still managed to scarf this one down.   Mac N cheese: the best I've ever had. The cheese was creamy and blended well with the Mac. Add the bacon jam to this dish. You won't regret it.   Dessert: lame, we didn't get any. My belly was down to the floor so I had to skip.   Enjoy!"}

Great place to sit, eat and just relax and listen to the music.  The patio is a great place to enjoy the spring weather in Las Vegas. Located in the downtown area of Las Vegas near  Fremont street.  The city is doing wonderful things downtown these days and from only going once or twice since I moved here 15 years ago, we find that we go as often as once a week and enjoy all that downtown offers.    Back to the Patio dining, the bar was attended by a lovely lady, I believe her name was Tara.  She was not only very attentive, but she was pleasant and had a great personality.

I could use adjectives like 'wonderful' and 'amazing', but these do not describe how awesome the food is. I've tried several dishes that I would normally shy away from, but every single one has been fantastic.    My last visit (March 2018) we sat at the bar in front of the chefs and right next to the pickup area for the waiters. Everyone was attentive and truly concerned about the overall experience. They gave us recommendations on food and drinks, all of which were good. We spent the entire night talking with Ethan and learning the history behind the restaurant. Places like this and restauranteurs like Cory are why eating out is not just a meal but experiences and memories I cherish.   Can't wait for the expansion to Atlanta! A two hour flight from Miami means I can enjoy this more often."}

Either way, their executive chef has got some neat ideas in that mind. Everything was good, we got the strawberry salad, crab fondue, espresso steak, chicken thighs, macaroni & cheese, tempura green beans, and burger. Nothing really disappointed. I did wish the crab fondue just came with bread but I can see how some would desire a textural contrast. For myself I prefer just the bread. Proteins were well seasoned. The fondue was a little salty but ... it's cheese what are you expecting? Just use more bread to cheese ratio and you're good. The small joint could get a little loud but the staff was super friendly. Drop by Downtown so you could give this place a try."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Oh god, the food is so good. Although I've only eaten here twice, I've sampled enough of the menu to rate this place a 5.   What I enjoy about Carson Kitchen is how many of the items on the menu are sharable, making this the perfect location to dine at with a small group. Emphasis on SMALL because this place does get packed around peak hours.   On to the food!  Crispy Chicken Skins: Eating these gave me a warm, comforting feeling..or were my arteries clogging up? Whatever. Fried chicken skins served without the chicken is a daydream come true. The smoked honey sauce goes great with skins, though the deep fried flavor is fine by itself.   Bison Meatloaf Sliders: I stalked Carson Kitchen's Instagram and spotted these sliders and had to have them. The petite patties are flavorful and moist and come with a side of tater tots.  Veal Meatballs: Essentially, fancy Swedish meatballs, but, you know, way better because of the sherry foie gras cream. *salivating*  Compared to my previous visit, the service was warmer, and I attribute this to having eaten at the bar. It just felt like we received more attention there as opposed to eating at a table. Before I forget, there are purse hooks beneath the bar counter, because who wants to cradle their baggage while eating?  I can't stress enough how dining here is a MUST if you're in the downtown area. The menu may sound unusual, but keep an open mind."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Even with the address in hand the location of Carson Kitchen was questionable since there was no sign with the name. The neighbor a doughnut shop jumped out at us with a large sign. We were seated immediately. Our arrival was mid way between lunch and dinner and there were several available tables. Our server promptly provided water and our cocktails. Initially the noise level was loud due to a table of six people. Once they received their food the talk level declined. Our server explained the menu and advised the food would come out as it is ready. We ordered the following  Killer Shrimp Secret Sunday Chicken  The Shrimp came out first. Very taste and crunchy the pepper creme and sliced jalapenos added some nice heat. A very enjoyable dish.   The chicken was ordered without the bun because we heard that it's a large breast. Right on it was large. The fried chicken was the best crunchy breast ever. Delicious!  Our table was in full view of the open kitchen and we could see them repeatedly check the chicken with a thermometer to insure it was cooked just right. The chicken comes with tater tots that are deep fried grated potato balls. They were crispy outside & soft inside. Goes well with the aioli or ketchup.  The wait time for the chicken was exceedingly long. At one point our sever brought over a complementary order of baked mac & cheese and apologized for the delay. Don't know what happened to cause the delay but when the check arrived there was no charge for the chicken. I questioned our server and she stated the chicken  was complementary due to the long wait. I was not expecting that response.  The baked mac & cheese is a large portion that easily feeds 2 people. I tried the mac & cheese but not being a fan I can only say it was tasty and filling..  One improvement I would like to see is padded seat cushions. Wood chairs become uncomfortable after a while."}

We had a large party (approx. 30 people) so we took up the majority of the upstairs patio. The weather this month in LV has been crazy so it was pretty windy and chilly! I wish they had space heaters, but who would have thought it would be 60 degrees in May in Las Vegas! I don't blame them for not being prepared.  The restaurant is super cool and trendy. Small intimate bar when you walk in and a cool patio and fire pit outside if you want some fresh air. The upstairs patio is spacious with a pretty view of the courthouse lit up at night.   Because we are a larger group, we had a fixed menu of items to try, but of course I took a peak at the regular menu. The variety of food sounds awesome and there were so many items I wanted to try. Their liquor menu is definitely unique. My husband ordered a vodka and the vodka that they suggested was a variety I have never heard before and I know my vodka!! ;) I am excited to come back and try the large variety of menu items and liquors.  We started with the tempura green beans which were a little on the cold side (probably because it was so cold outside), but I really enjoyed the aioli dipping sauce. We next tried the sliders which were very flavorful and tasty, definitely one of my more favorite items. We received the tater tots at the same time and they weren't anything special, but who am I to complain about deep-fried spuds, I'm all in!! We also tried the rainbow cauliflower which was so unique and I loved the vinegar sauce it was tossed in! The crispy chicken skins with honey was so interesting and tasty. We also tried the bacon jam which was so so unique. I probably would not order that again, but I am glad I tried it! Again, it was a tad on the cold side probably because it was so chilly outside. We also got potatoes with garlic, which if you put garlic on anything I will love it! But the BEST item we received was the bread pudding. The pudding is made with donuts from nearby and they are glazed. It was so yummy that we asked for seconds!!  The service was great and patient considering we had a large party of hungry people. I thought our server particularly was so friendly, wish I got his name! I cannot wait to try Carson Kitchen again. If you are a vegas local in search of a trendy, intimate spot with unique and interesting food and specialty liquor, go to Carson Kitchen tonight!!"}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "A nice spot to have dinner downtown.  Environment: The restaurant itself is in downtown Las Vegas and is small inside. However, it looks as if they have done some renovations in recent months as they now have a separate bar area which is great if you do not want to have to wait for a table (which they usually have a wait). Additionally, they do have an outdoor patio area in the back which tends to fill up fast as well.  Food: The food here is southern inspired and so far, everything that I have had here has been good. On my most recent visit, I tried the pork chop as well as the gyro tacos. The pork chop was cooked very well, and it was paired with a very nice sauce. Additionally, the fried chicken skins are a great appetizer. The only thing I will say is that the cocktails are below average. They taste too weak and even when I ordered a long island just tasted like lemonade. I typically stick to old-fashioned when ordering drinks here.  Service: Service has always been adequate and I have never felt like I was left waiting for someone to check up on me, and sitting at the bar, the bartender was sure to check up on us and refill our waters when necessary.  Overall, Carson's Kitchen is a nice, fun spot to grab dinner downtown, and while I wouldn't say it's my favorite spot it is somewhere I could see myself coming every couple month."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This is a review that I admittedly feel bad writing, as it always tugs on my heartstrings a bit to see a place fall from grace. I have dined at Carson Kitchen a total of 6 times now and had I written my review after the first two times, I would have easily given them 5/5 stars, but now that I have dined there several more times since, I feel like there is a bit of complacency that has resulted in the restaurant going downhill a bit in both its food quality, variety, and service.   Starting with the menu. Chef Kerry Simon developed the original menu and when they first opened, they discussed how the menu would change over time and that things would come and go for variety. I totally respect that and think it is refreshing. We ordered the Spam Croquettes on our first visit and unfortunately it was one of the first things to be removed and never come back. Other items we have tried over the times we have been there are the Bacon Jam, the Chicken Skins, the risotto, tacos, and many others. It seems like the fryer has been in overdrive lately as the fried items are simply too over fried. The bacon jam was heavily seasoned and though some grease is expected, it was taken to the extreme.   We prefer to dine upstairs on the patio, and when it is available, we always request it. Nice view and a peaceful modern setting. The dining area downstairs is a bit cramped and a little too hipster modern for our tastes. The hostess is friendly enough but also seemed a bit agitated at times.   Refills on drinks and water tend to be pretty slow and my biggest complaint: no refills on sodas and no draft beer as they do not have a soda fountain or taps. I really do not like restaurants that only serve canned or bottled sodas but I can deal with it when the food and service make up for it. Unfortunately, Carson Kitchen has fallen short recently. I am sincerely hoping that they will get their shit together and bring back the friendly hipster service and well prepared menu items that I recall them having when they grand opened."}

After a 14 hour flight that was much welcome and his outstanding service provided a great evening of fun for my and my partner. Thanks again."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I was in Old Vegas with my team, and someone had mentioned that they'd heard that Carson Kitchen was a hot place to check out.  So we did.  Finding it was a bit of a challenge - if you go to the address given, you will NOT find it...it's around on the side of the building.    We did figure it out, and immediately saw two things: - the place was PACKED - the place was also smallish But, we were told to go check out the bar, and we'd have a table in a bit.  So we ordered some drinks and chatted - turns out in a bit was about 10 minutes - so not bad for a group of seven.  We got to our table (quite rustic), and checked out the menu.  Here's where it got REALLY interesting really fast.  When you order something...anything - it's served family style.  Steak, potatoes, calamari, whatever...it gets sliced up and put on the table for all to enjoy.  Definitely a bit different, but it meant we could explore - and explore we did.  I think we ended up with one order of everything on the menu.   And ignoring the fru-fru stuff (colored cauliflower?  Ugh) it was all quite delish - prepared perfectly.  I don't think a single plate was left with anything on it.  If you're in Old Vegas, definitely worth checking out.  Good fresh food, unique, good service."}

I love that we got to see the chefs creating the food, it was so interesting! I had gyro tacos and although they were smaller than I thought they'd be, they were delicious. My husband got the beef sliders and they came with tater tots which were also delicious. The waitstaff was cordial and helpful.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "There's a lot of praise going on here and I am in the same boat. However, there are some flaws for Carson Kitchen, the first being the place is cramped and loud. However, this seems to be the theme of a lot of Downtown eateries these days. Even if it is cramped and loud I must admit the openness of the restaurant is not at all off-putting. I was thrilled to see an open kitchen, with food being prepped before my eyes and a kitchen staff that is lively and nice to talk to while sitting in front of their prepping/cooking areas.  Food was superb. I ordered the Devil's egg, beautiful little concoctions served up with a topping of caviar. I'm so fancy for my lunch, huh?  I also selected the Spicy Sausage flatbread, which came with sausage, broccoli, ricotta, and fennel. It was a medley of delicious, fresh flavors. Crust was delightfully crisp, not soggy.  Really the only thing I have to say in the negative is the service was lacking. It was busy, and our waitress did apologize for the wait, but when we paid our check I put in $20 for my meal and my friend wanted to put the rest on her card. It wasn't as if we were asking for a feat of grandiose nature, but the waitress told us the system wasn't working - well, you can't run a card and take cash? It just seemed fishy to me and made me wonder how often the system is down at this place.  I'd certainly return, hopefully when I do their system will be back up so my friend and I can simply pay with cash and card like at most places."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "We stopped in here for some tapas. This place had a very trendy atmosphere, very social gathering inspired. The wait staff was wonderful. Each food item was delivered and a description given, by different staff members. It was impressive how consistent their food delivery presentation was from server to server.      This place has something going for them, innovative tapas. The menu is a social or sharing menu, meaning you order several items and share them amongst your group.      We ordered a bunch of items, Bacon Jam, fried chicken skin, gyro tacos, charred octopus, and kicking shrimp. All of our food was very good and interesting in concept. The Kicking shrimp was exceptional, one of my faves.     We also order the donut dessert, which was out of this world. It is worth a visit just for this dessert.      All in all, this is a great spot with some creative takes on tapas, worth a visit."}

Friendly and efficient service, excellent, tasty food, we can't wait to return. If you go, you must try the bacon jam dish."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I agree that this place is overhyped. I don't recommend this place if you are a vegetarian or health conscious.  The bacon jam tasted good but visually was not appealing due to its blackish color (and even a little gross because it was marinating in its fat).  The lamb in the gyros were dried out, so much so that even the yogurt sauce didn't cover up the dryness. The pita bread was moist and tasty though, and I have to wonder whether this would do better as a vegetarian dish.  The two dishes I really enjoyed were the Cuban (although did it really need to be pork belly?) and the mac and cheese. Both were flavorful and moist.  However, I can't in good conscious give more than 3 stars since this was only half the dishes, and I can't imagine the calories cost to achieve those flavors.  I can't ignore that the mac and cheese probably had a stick of butter and 1/2 pound of cheese mixed with only 6 ounces of pasta. I can't ignore that the Cuban probably had 5 slices of cheese on 2 buttered slices of toast. Just because I choose to eat out doesn't mean I want to eat a 2000 calorie meal. If I wanted that, I'd have gone to Heart Attack down the street."}

I think they have seats outside and upstairs but were inside in the main area. We sat at a bar table with the kitchen right in front of us. I usually HATE watching my food being made but everything looked sanitary I didn't really mind. Everyone wore gloves when they prepared the food and washed Properly.   For foods; Cocoa-espresso NY steak-- delicious! Just the way I liked my steak made. Very tender, cooked medium rare but not deadly looking. The crust on the steak had a grill taste to it and the red wine demi gave it personality! one of the best steaks I ever had. It isn't a large portion though, I wish there was more meat to it!   Baked Mac & cheese-- secret ingredient was definitely Truffle! I know that amazing taste. Very very cheesy! They did not cheap out on the cheese. I loved how it was baked so the top had a nice crust on it giving it some texture when you eat it.   gyro tacos-- made with lamb but did not have that gamey taste that usually lamb has. There was a amazing yogurt sauce that gyros usually come with. It comes with 3 tacos and you wish it was 6! It is a nice size taco and not a miniature one. It really tasted like a taco even though it was lamb.   The staff were very attentive and checked in on us frequently but not bothersome. I definitely will be returning soon!"}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I called because I wasn't sure if they did happy hour , they don't. I then asked to make a reservation, mainly because I knew first Friday evenings pack everything in down town. They don't take reservations for a party of 4 , apparently that's too small for them.  Perhaps if it was delivered differently I would have a different opinion.  Regardless, I still went because we planned to try with friends who have also never been. I also live in downtown so I am always curious of the culinary scene.   They take your name down, how many in your party, tell you the wait time, and then to come back. They don't take your number they don't call or they don't text. I found this frustrating. Something needs to be done about this.  After having to wander around down town and make many laps in this blazing heat, we finally were seated. I have to say 5 stars for the service from our waitress. Wish I could remember her name she was so nice and pleasant and very suggestive. We ordered many things as our appetites grew.  The deviled eggs with caviar is great, the gyro tacos ok. The fried chicken skin good , didn't care for the jam butter with bread. The turkey mango burger was sweet. The tarter tots were delicious. I would come back again when it's slow or if I have a large party enough for this restaurant to take my reservation.   Again, my only complaint I have is my experience about the whole reservation thing and no text or call back not even a buzzer."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "So, I finally had the chance to visit Carson Kitchen in Downtown Las Vegas a few weeks ago for lunch. I had really liked Kerry Simon's previous restaurant, Simon Kitchen & Bar, at the HRH, so I figured that his newest restaurant near the Downtown Container Park would be pretty good. And my thoughts were that they did not disappoint!  THE DECOR (4.5 out of 5) Upon entering the restaurant which seemed to have some lower ceilings, it seemed to not have that much of a dining area beyond a few tables, the bar area and seating near the kitchen. However, they do have a larger area upstairs on their rooftop patio which I think would be great for parties. The restaurant is kind of dimly lit, but with plenty of accent lighting in the bar area and in the kitchen, so I kind of liked it. It had a hip but intimate vibe to it. They also had an outdoor patio area where we waited for a couple of seats to open up which was nice, although that might get a little hot in the heat of the summer.  THE SERVICE (4.5 out of 5)  So after a short wait outside on that patio, we were seated at a couple of chairs that were immediately adjacent to the kitchen where we were literally a few feet away from one of the prep/sous chefs (not exactly sure what her title was, so just go with me here). Our server explained that many of their dishes are of the shareable kind and was attentive to our needs when we needed a refill, etc.  THE FOOD (5 out of 5) And what did I think about the food? I thought that it was delicious! We had a couple of social plates of the Bacon Jam (which was awe-some.....and I wish that they would jar that stuff up because I'd buy a few jars of it if they did) and the Devil's Eggs with crispy pancetta + caviar (I liked it although I think that I would've liked to have had the pancetta more thinly chopped, my preference). Then I had the Pork Belly Cuban Sandwich which came with spicy tator tots (which was great and came with tasso ham + manchego cheese).   Next time I'm going to try the Crispy Chicken Skins and the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto which a really good friend of mine (also another foodie) said were really good!  OVERALL (5 out of 5) Overall, I think that Carson Kitchen is more like a 4.5 out of 5, but since Yelp doesn't offer any 1/2 ratings, I decided to give it 5 stars (as 4 stars just isn't quite enough). So, if you're looking for some really good food, I'd highly suggest checking out Carson Kitchen as it is now my GO-TO spot Downtown."}

Ordered 2 cocktails (delicious) and the Chicken Skins and Deviled Eggs, which were both incredible.  I can't wait to go back for a full meal!!   The only thing that is keeping me from giving 5 stars is how hot it was in the restaurant.  I realize they have an open kitchen, and that it was 110 degrees yesterday, but it was notably uncomfortable."}

We waited in the bar area and when two seats opened up at the bar we went to go sit there but were told they use the bar as regular dinner service area so we went back to sitting on the window sill. We ended up being seated at the bar anyway and we ordered four items.  They bring food out when it's ready as opposed to bringing it all out together.  They forgot our salad so we cancelled it and ordered a dessert instead but that was taking a long time so we cancelled that too.  The Mac & cheese was amazing and so were the tempura green beans.

We were finally seated, but I did not realize the bar area was part of dinner seating. Our bartender/waitress was awesome. Dining space a little tight at the bar, so I would probably request a table next time. We shared the bacon jam, gyro tacos, and the sea bass. The toasted baguettes were tearing up the roof of my mouth Cap'n Crunch-style, but the bacon jam was too good to stop! The tacos tasted Greek, but still felt like a taco (if that makes any sense). The sea bass was excellent--tender on the inside with a nice crust on top. My husband found a new favorite beer here: Maui Bikini Blonde. The food and drinks were excellent, and the atmosphere was great, too. Thank you for a great evening. We will definitely come back."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Great restaurant in the downtown Las Vegas area. Dim with lots of shared seating tables.  We ordered: -Crispy Chicken Skins ($9): 4/5 stars. The skins make a great appetizer-- they're crunchy, flavorful, and pairs well with the sauce. However, they're very easy to make at home! If you ever purchase a pack of chicken thighs from the grocery store, you could very easily remove the skins from all of them and fry them like this -Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip ($19): 4/5. Expensive-- for $19, you get the strip but no sides. Similar to the skins, the sauce sweetens the food a tad bit. Meat was tender and the red wine demi was a great, unique pairing for the steak -Butter Burger ($14): 3/5 stars. Nothing special, just a burger. The tater tots that came with it tho.... a little spicy but great change from the typical burger & fries"}

They clearly do NOT know how to work their POS and charged my card 4 times for the same meal and so my $65 meal has now cost me $275, a call to the manager, and fraud reports to my bank.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Excellent service.  I won't be back for the food though.  Ordered the following:  Devil's Eggs: basically 6 deviled eggs with a sprinkling of black caviar and crunchy pancetta bits replacing the paprika.  I love deviled eggs and this version tasted okay, but I couldn't help thinking that real deviled eggs have more flavor, because of the spice from the paprika.  This version was just salty, and the egg filling was a little on the dry side as well.  The pancetta was the best part.  The caviar didn't have much of a flavor impact.  I think I would have been more impressed with the dish if they had replaced the black caviar with Japanese flying fish roe or salmon roe and added a drop of spicy sauce as well, because Japanese roe has that poppy texture that was missing with the black caviar.  Plus it's orange, so the presentation would be more exciting, more of a play on the traditional deviled eggs.   Roasted beet salad: the description sounded good but the flavors did not meld well for me.  Besides the beets, it had mandarin oranges, goat cheese, pistachios.  I think it would have tasted better if the beets were sliced thinner instead of in big chunks, and maybe if the pistachios were replaced with candied walnuts or pecans.    Rainbow Cauliflower: I prefer roasted cauliflower to whatever they did to this cauliflower.  Roasted cauliflower is more tender and the olive oil carmelizes, bringing out the natural sweetness of the cauliflower.  This version had no sweetness, only salt.  I didn't taste much or any garlic and lemon, which is what other reviewers have raved about.  And the cauliflower was still very crunchy.  It was another miss for me.  Hmm...looking at the photos other people have posted on Yelp, I see that I didn't get nearly as much caviar on my eggs as others did.  It really was just a sprinkling, whereas I saw in one photo that it was piled on.  I wonder if I caught the kitchen on an off night."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "I loved my experience here!  When I found myself in the Freemont Street area on a Friday night I turned to Yelp for restaurant suggestions.  The reviews were spot on.  Carson Kitchen is amazing.   We were happy that there was no wait to be seated.  This was because we were OK with being seated at one of the communal tables.  Even though they are shared tables, you still have your own space and a decent amount of privacy.  We were in the back corner of the restaurant which gave us a great view of the fun scene that unfolds in this restaurant. The server was friendly and informative.  She gave us plenty of information without being pushy or rude.  When we had questions, she answered them politely.  This was very helpful as we weren't sure how much and what to order.  She suggested 1-2 plates per person.   We ordered the bacon jam to share, I ordered the tempura green beans and my dining companion ordered the jerk turkey burger.   Food is brought out as it is ready (instead of in a specific order, like a salad or appetizer first).   Everything we tried was phenomenal.  The bacon jam was totally unique and totally amazing.  A great combination of sweet and savory.  It included the bacon jam and some spreadable cheese on top.  It is served with bread.  The only slight down side is that I did wish it came with more bread,  You can order extra for $1 or so.  But you can also eat the jam by the spoonful (it is that good).  It does take awhile to cool.  The green beans were served with a cream cheese/hot pepper spread.  The beans had a crispness to them and the amount of breading on them was perfect.  I came hungry and was totally satisfied with splitting the bacon jam and eating the green beans.  My dining companion had the jerk turkey burger and commented that it was one of the tastiest she's ever had. An all around wonderful experience."}

With all the overwhelming positive reviews, we were excited to try it!  Our server Felicia was amazing! We asked for recommendations and she gave us quite a few. We decided to go with the bacon jam, devil's eggs, and jerk turkey burger. The bacon jam is perfect blend of sweet and savory, and is served with toastinis. The devil's eggs was creamy and delicious. The turkey burger had nicely toasted buns, topped with cole slaw. It also comes with a side of spicy tater tots.  Unfortunately I have little to no tolerance for spicy items (my friend loves spicy though!) and I found the bacon jam and jerk turkey burger to be very spicy. Luckily, Felicia kept refilling my water as I was chugging the cup after every bite of the food. Everything was very delicious! Despite the spiciness, my favorite dish from that day is actually the bacon jam!"}

I asked again when I ordered, she said yes. When I asked for a second helping of it (because it was so good), I confirmed that once again it was vegan.  Tipped her well, everything was fine. The next day I find out it wasn't vegan. I wrote a very normal, not even 1 star review stating that although this place is a downtown favorite, I was served non-vegan food when I asked if it was vegan.  Owner messaged me and went on a complete psychopathic tirade. All his servers did was mess up - I was a server downtown before and I understand people aren't perfect. He was fixated on that I knew one of the servers who happened to have a sister who shared the physical description of her - or something. I'm still not quite entirely sure. It sounds like his server said we all knew her and were out to get her, to save her skin when she messed up.  He posted a comment below, saying we went on Saturday (we went on Friday), we didn't tip well (I have my receipt), and that we were being rude to the servers we don't know, and that we were lying. I told him to please feel free to look at security cameras.   He has now mentioned our names in public, threatened to sue me and reach out to my place of work, stalked my Yelp reviews for reviews I made with friends who had eaten dishes or when I was not previously vegan. In a long string of private messages, he has accused me or so many things. It's rather bizarre, and WTF-worthy. Dude, your servers just messed up. Should've apologized nicely, asked me to take it down. call it a day. Would've been very disappointing for someone with severe dairy allergies or someone who had been vegan for much longer than I have to have to go through with this.  I also know I'm not the only person who has received strange and terrible customer service here. :)"}

Baked Mac & Cheese with Parmesan splinters were good, and Fingerling Potatoes excellent.  Grilled Rainbow Cauliflower was colorful but tasted no different than regular white cauliflower.  Bacon Jam Brie was rich and unique.  Short Rib Stroganoff with Cognac, Button and Portabello Mushrooms, and spinach was very good.  And homemade Tater Tots were great.  The contemporary decor and tableware here are quite inventive.

We visited this restaurant for date night, and wished we had discovered it sooner! We brought our own bottle of wine ($20 corkage fee), and enjoyed some of their signature dishes:  * Fried chicken skins- A MUST try. Seasoned and fried to golden perfection, these are the perfect opener for any meal.  * Bacon and brie jam- Sweet, tangy and a bit spicy. The mixture of flavors in this dish are just awesome and will surely have you coming for more.  * Turkey burger- Yes, I know it sounds plain. The truth is, this sandwich is anything BUT plain. With tropical and jerk seasoning flavors, this is the BEST burger I have had. In fact, you will leave that place in love with the explosion of flavors in the dish.  * Last but not least, we had the doughnut bread pudding which was the perfect desert for the night. Fluffy, sweet and heavenly, this is the best bread pudding in town!  I thank you for reading my review now, as I know you will thank me for writing it once you experience this place."}

We ordered the chicken skins, which was an interesting choice but highly recommended. I don't know what it was but I sneezed each time I took a bite. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed them! We also had the tempura green beans, which were really good with the jelly.  I opted for the osso buco, which was nothing special and it was really small. Everyone else had the filet and I think they won out.   I found the menu a bit limited but that isn't a bad thing as they do fewer thing better (in theory). The prices were pretty good considering where you are. It's a good place to socialize and recommended."}

It was quite busy on a weeknight and I think I would not have gotten in if I weren't alone and willing to sit at the bar.  That turned out to be the best place to be, as the service and hospitality were outstanding.  After I insisted, the bartender selected and made me one of their menu cocktails, which was quite good and not something I was used to.  We got to talking, along with another patron and Carson Kitchen regular.  Expressing skepticism that their turkey burger could be edible, as it was, a turkey burger, a heated exchange ensued and a challenge was issued.  They got me to agree to order a Turkey burger, claiming it has won competitions with serious beef burgers around town.  First came the deviled eggs which, with caviar and bacon, were very good and went quickly.  At this point we were all friends at the bar and the eggs were shared - it was that kind of vibe.  The Turkey Burger:  Firstly, the tots.  Mmmmmm....  Oh how good - perfect tater tots with ketchup.  Nice color and crunch.  10/10  The burger was very good and I'm glad I ordered it.  It was not a good alternative to a beef burger (sorry) but can stand on its own a separate type of food entirely.  If you strongly desire a great beef burger - stay away!  If you just want something delicious, then seriously consider it.  The complexity of flavors was very well done and the overall result had me clean my plate.  What a pleasure to sit at the bar with Felicia and her loyal patrons for a delicious meal.  Also thanks for the samples, barman with nice hair.  Be warned they close early for Vegas and they will run out of popular dishes, so go early."}

Enjoyed the bacon jam, veal meatballs (a bit oversalted), and star of the menu was the gyro tacos.  Strong beer selection, but having options on tap is necessary as opposed to only bottled choices, particularly for a 'gastropub' type place like this.  Service was very friendly (we sat at the bar).  One service misstep that was a bit 'nickle and dime' (something very out of character for a Kerry Simon restaurant) is when we were approached and asked, unsolicitedly, if we want more baguette slices for our bacon jam (we said sure, as there was more bacon jam than bread).  The wait staff graciously brought this too us, and an undisclosed charge for this showed up on our bill.   It is a pet peeve of mine when service staff offers something nominal like this (four small baguette slices), not solicited by the customer, and charges you - if they are going to do this - they should either disclose it as an upcharge, or not offer something nominal unless it gratuitous for their customers - they need to work on this type of item - I expect a bit more out of a place of this caliber on this type of thing."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Recently undergoing a change in the kitchen, Kerry Simon's brother Scott returning to Las Vegas after years at Simon's restaurant in the rebranding Hard Rock Chicago, it was with two others that seats were taken at Carson Kitchen on Saturday, the current late-Fall/Winter menu featuring seven new food items from Cory and team plus three new Cocktails from the mind of Matthew Harwell.  Decorating the expanded space festively, steel stools less comfortable than backed-chairs at the kitchen counter but creating substantially more room and thus shorter wait times during a rush, it was to an expectedly warm welcome that guests were greeted and led to a table in the center of the dining room, a familiar young man in vintage Guns n' Roses apparel quickly filling Water as well as Iced Tea before starting the show.  Busier than most Restaurants during Sin City's slow season, the original part of Carson Kitchen about 2/3 full at noon while the bar contained three additional patrons, it was from that area that tasting started off with a pink drink called Mr. Big that Matt claims he did not name, the Alcohol here taking a backseat to Citrus and Herbs which paired nicely to the bold spice profile of Mussels amidst spicy Calabrian Sausage in Wine plus day one staple Tempura Green Beans that remain a best seller thanks to light Batter plus the Red Pepper Cream Cheese made for dipping.  Rounding out the first course with a Green Goddess Caesar Salad, the accompanying 'Crouton' an interesting trio of bites while the rest was fairly predictable, it was as a reprise of last year's Pair of Pears that Matthew presented Sunday Kind of Love featuring Whistling Andy Gin and White Wine used to poach Pears for a new Salad, the pairing obviously excellent though the Orange also lent well to a recently updated Young Beet dish with Honey and Goat Cheese while the overall freshness helped tame flaky Red Snapper in Curry broth with crispy Noodles.  Progressing at a good pace, four courses served in less than two hours as Credence Clear Water Revival and The Rolling Stones entertained overhead, it was in an attempt to lure Whiskey drinkers over to Rum that Matthew says he created 42 Bridges, the poignant bitterness slowly dissipating and revealing complexity but still too spirit-forward for most, though it did admittedly pair nicely with Carson Kitchen's new Chicken Thighs atop sweet Pumpkin Puree as well as Caramel Creamed Corn that plays off the idea of caramelizing Kernels in the skillet before adding cream, the result far more subtle but just as delicious as the name makes it sound.  Plenty familiar with Rainbow Cauliflower and Cory's Veal Meatballs in Sherry Foie Gras Cream, a Secret Sunday Chicken Sandwich added on for those who had never had the pleasure, it was deferring Coffee for once that lunch came to a close with three old pals, two of them ever present for good reason while the Banoffee Pie represents the first Dessert ever to make a return, though this time rumor suggests it may stick around.  FIVE STARS:  In an industry of constantly changing faces on the line December 2017 represents a homecoming for Chef Scott Simon to the place his brother helped create, and with the larger space now offering shorter wait times during peak times the Winter Menu shows everything as good as ever in terms of Food and Drink."}

At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!  The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.  I'd classify the fare as New American.  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their Wellington Empanada was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.    My wife gasped when she saw they offered Crispy Chicken Skins and ordered it almost before our server got out the word hello.  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.  We shared the Rabbit Ragu and the Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surprisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

But I think they can add a dollar more and give one more egg.   The pierogi tasted very bland. Thank goodness for the Cheese wiz with it.  My main issue was their risotto. The rice was so undercooked. The rice was hard. I wanted to send it back but I'm seen the movie waiting and I didn't want to be bothersome since my friends and I were having a good time.

I've spoken with the owner since my original review and there was a misunderstanding over the phone. We were expecting a table when we got there. Had we understood that that it would be such a long wait (45 min), we would have opted for a different restaurant.  I'm changing my review from 1 star to 2 because I did not have a good experience here as I was disappointed by the service / communication here as we waited in the restaurant. I've been to other restaurant that do those things better. Their phone service is very good.  As per my previous review, I probably caught them on an off night. If I dine here again when I return to Vegas, I'll update my review.    OLD REVIEW: I was really excited to try this place out last Tuesday. I called them up to see if a table was available for a party of 3. I spoke with Matt who said one would be available in around 20 minutes. He put our name on the list and he advised us not to park in the lot across the street so we parked in the Container Park lot and paid $10 to do so.   We made it to the restaurant 20 minutes later hungry and expecting a table. The girl at the front counter greeted us and informed us a table wasn't ready yet but would be soon as we were one of the next 2 in line. We understood and waited our turn.    We kept checking back in but she kept giving us the same story. It was very cramped inside as we waited so we spent a little time outside waiting where there were wind gusts up to 50mph.   After waiting 45 minutes, they gave our table to a larger party and she told us to continue to wait. I'm sure we caught them on an off night but the experience at the restaurant sucked and I cannot recommend them and don't think I'd ever come back, which is too bad because the food and atmosphere looked promising."}

The service was great and the staff was so helpful. A few hiccups of forgotten refills and plates to the wrong table, but it happens with new spots and they handled it with a bit a humor.

Ok, I get it, I might be a bit older than their normal clientele, but it felt like I was in a club, not a restaurant.  I brought my book to read while I ate but that was not possible.  I even think conversation wouldn't be comfortable.  Maybe it's just me but loud rock and roll (even good rock music) during dinner doesn't increase my appetite. It's just annoying.  Staff was very friendly and polite.  I might try again but next time I'll not be too hungry and bring ear plugs:-)"}

At some point you have to ask yourself: is there anything I ate that I would crave some random Wednesday night?  And we didn't feel that about anything we had.  For the record we ordered: crispy chicken skin, deviled egg with caviar and pancetta, grilled artichoke, beet salad, and oxtail risotto.    I try not to judge on service or ambiance too much, in the end if the food is amazing you'll go back.  But  I'm not a fan on shared seating (one long table with other people crowded around you); prefer some privacy for conversations and I hate the feeling of eavesdropping on the person sitting 1ft away from you."}

I love the rustic industrial style they have going on. Definitely feels like a hipster spot, but I brought my husband and kids and didn't feel too terribly out of place. Service was very friendly. I ordered the chicken skins. This item is what brought me here in the first place. The spicy honey sauce was great, I just felt like the skins were a little overcooked. 3 stars. I also ordered the *Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto* which was fabulous. 5 stars. The black rice had an interesting texture and the oxtail was tender and rich. I would return for this dish, for sure. I'd also return for the dessert. The *Glazed Donut Bread Pudding* was SO good. 5 stars, again. My husband's chicken sandwich was ok. Not bad but not great. 3 stars. Not quite worth the price of admission. The BBQ Burnt Ends were just that. Burnt and dry. I thought it was a clever idea, but it just didn't hit the mark for me. 2 stars. Considering the price of the bill and how satisfied I was with everything, I would probably lean toward 3 stars but I'm hoping that I maybe I caught them on an off day or maybe there are other items on the menu that are fantastic."}

Always made sure we had full drinks, coursed out our food timely, and made great recommendations on what to order.  We had a variety of items.  Fried green beans were delicious.  Young beet salad, not my fancy, but tasty. I'm not a fan of beets, personal preference, but I still enjoyed it.  Oxtail risotto, something new for me, but delicious.  Bacon jam was a bit sweeter than I had expected, but good.  It could use a bit more baked brie in it than they currently use to prepare the dish.

Small in size but chock-full of character with exposed beams and cinder-block styling surrounding the central kitchen it was just moments after 11:30 when our trio sat down and after an idiot-proof explanation of a menu designed for foodies with everything is delicious idioms aplenty it was on a meal of eleven items that we settled, the majority of the selections coming from those designed to share and each proving well priced given the quality and quantity of ingredients involved.  Clearly leaning on Simon's penchant for comfort food whimsy and benefitted by the skills of Executive Chef Matt Andrews it was specifically at our request that items rolled out of the kitchen with deliberate individual pacing and beginning first with creamy deviled eggs crowned in briny bubbles of roe the hits came quickly, a back-to-back pairing of chicken skins and bacon marmalade each justifying their early 'signature' status while a follow-up of nutty rabbit cooked tender in bright tomatoes over shredded squash showed equally well.  Generally underwhelmed by the meaty lamb 'tacos' wrapped in lightly charred pita and finding the empanada overwhelmed by the onion-heavy sauce it was back on good footing that the kitchen found itself with a deep bowl of crispy sprouts balanced by pork plus balsamic and culminating in a flatbread teaming with mushrooms beneath an especially heady blue it was onward to dessert that we progressed, a trio of options served simultaneously with both the subtly sweet bread pudding and decadent brownie arriving boozed up and bound to impress."}

It's recommended to arrive in full hipster swag, sporting a beard with an extended mustache with curved tips a la Hercule Poirot. Only then do you have the luxury to purchase three tiny 'gyro tacos' the size of one regular street taco from pretty much any of the (pretty well reviewed) taco trucks I've been to. For eleven bucks! Want a diet coke to wash that down? I'm surprised they have such low class beverages at a hipster joint like this. But they do. But it comes in a tiny bottle that they up charge for, and it's not on the menu (secret menu for regular people drinks).   When the hipster culture becomes a self-licking ice cream cone, you get hipsters opening portentous little restaurants, frequented by none other than? You guessed it, hipsters (and those who happen to do google searches for top rated restaurants in downtown, only to be fooled by self-licking reviews into coming to this overpriced joint) with a bar.   The normal looking white collar guy sitting next to me had the same opinion of the portion size (tiny hipster size) and the taste of the 'bacon jam'  - both pretty awful (they charge thirteen bucks ! for a slice of baked brie in some jam, and dried baguettes, as though putting brie cheese into jam and cayenne pepper makes sense, or more sense than these items served separately. Hint: it doesn't). The white collar guy next to me rejected his dish after trying it, and I don't blame him.  Want even more portentousness? When the server brings you your minimalist dish, as though you were dining at a high cuisine restaurant, he explains the dish to you, perhaps to distract you from the tiny size of the food on the plate. Apparently the sea bass is citrus encrusted with the skin still on the side for some reason. The cost of citrus encrusted sea bass? Approximately a nine inch length of it (I'm very familiar with this size) will set you back eighteen smackers.   If you wanna feel good about your social group, and you belong to this group, then by all means, luck the ice cream cone you helped scoop. If not, save your money and go to a normal restaurant where diet coke and beers are on tap."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Giving this place an okay and passing 3 stars. I do not write reviews but I came into this place with pretty high expectations and I'm pretty disappointed. I'm just motivated to write this review out of sheer disappointment.  Came in Saturday night around 9:30. Already missed the dinner rush but this place was still packed and the vibe and ambiance was still upbeat. We sat at the counter and got a good view of the kitchen. Our server Courtney was very nice and pleasant.  Ordered the Magarian for a drink. Aviation gin, thyme, lemon, honey, and cucumber soda water. It was pretty standard. Nothing special.  Now the food. Ordered the beet salad. The cauliflower. Veal meatballs. Steak. Sliders. Tacos. And the fudge brownie for dessert.  I think I like this dish just because I love beets in general. Came with orange slices, goat cheese, and pistachios. Eat everything together and it's good. If you're not a beet eater you might think this dish is awesome but if you're like me this dish is just your standard beet salad.  Veal meatballs. Nicely executed but I found the flavor lacking. Meatballs were light and not dense. Prepared and cooked nicely. It was actually enjoyable to eat except it needs more flavor. It was under seasoned. The sherry foie gras cream was nice. Though you can't really taste the foie. It was a rich sauce but not reminiscent of foie at all. So that under delivered. And the peas, I don't know what it's doing on that dish. It could've been a pea shoot salad with a nice zippy dressing to cut through that cream.  The steak. We asked for medium rare and it was cooked medium rare. Nice crust on the steak, pink inside, and a nice sauce to accompany it with. But for a restaurant with a reputation like this I already expect that you know how to cook steak. Although maybe they could've used some finishing salt here. Fleur de sel. Himalayan. Black. Any salt sprinkled on top by the kitchen to let me know there's some thought in this dish. Don't just send me a piece of meat. Send me a piece of meat with some oomph! Oh and please. Don't tell me about the salt shaker! For 18 bucks I think it should've came with a side of something. Potatoes or cream spinach or asparagus spears. Just something, anything to eat with the steak. Doesn't have to be big or a lot. Meat needs something. Even Michelin rated restaurants give you something. Mind is not blown here.   The lamb gyros. They were good but you can live with skipping it. Find real lamb gyros somewhere else. I just have to say that the meat tasted like spaghetti meat sauce without the sauce.  Short rib sliders. We ordered these under the recommendation of our server. She said these are to die for. I thought otherwise. I didn't read the description on this because I trusted our server so I took a bite knowing full well what short ribs should taste like. Meaty, rich, deep, earthy short ribs except they were not!!! I love short ribs so I was very, very, very disappointed. There was something sweet in it then I read the description it said rootbeer glaze. It might as well say sugar syrup because you can't taste the rootbeer. You just taste sweet.  There was no taste or note of caramelization to merit it to be even called a glaze. That was a sad excuse to call it a glaze. It wasn't deep or rich. I picked apart my slider so I could taste just the meat and it was just blah. It is shockingly dull and under seasoned. The slider buns came from a bag. They weren't warmed or anything. Eating it felt like a chore. Also served with tater tots. Which probably was the highlight of the dish... Maybe the night.   Now the dessert. Bourbon fudge brownie and brown butter bacon ice cream. The ice cream was good. Enjoyable actually. But that brownie. My god! that brownie! That brownie was served to us frozen hard as a brick. It was so hard that when we tried to slice it the brownie flipped out of the plate and onto the floor. Didn't need utensils at all cuz we were eating what's left of the brownie with our hands. Picking it up and biting off bits of it like solid chocolate. It was terrible.  We also ordered the cauliflower because our server recommended it but the kitchen might've forgotten to make it. Dessert came and our check came but our cauliflower never made it to our table. It was still included in our tab though so I just asked the server to take it off. She let the kitchen know what happened and Courtney came back and apologized and took it off out check.  Would I come back here? I might. There are other dishes here that still interests me to try. I wouldn't take my out of town friends here though. There are other great places to try out, experiment, and enjoy. It's a nice looking restaurant with a cool vibe and ambiance to it. It's a cool spot to be seen but the food while has great concept suffers from the lack of depth of flavor and under seasoning.   Final note. When working in the kitchen: TASTE TASTE TASTE TASTE! Taste your food before you send it out to us!!"}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "The pictures for this place looked amazing, they were mouth-watering.  We waited an hour for a table, which isn't that bad considering it was Saturday night so you can't be mad about that. One annoying part though was that they had plenty of open tables on their patio but they don't let you sit in them even if you've ordered drinks from the bar. You must stand at the bar or wander around the courtyard. The bussers would jump on different parties the instant they sat down with their drinks, claiming the tables were for parties being seated... the problem is parties were never seated in those tables.   The food looked amazing in person as well. The problem was that everything was very heavy handed. The bacon jam was great for the first bite or two but just had so much pepper and spice that it was overwhelming and you couldn't even taste the bacon. The deviled eggs were pretty good. The mac and cheese was DRENCHED in truffle oil. I can still taste it a week later. We absolutely love mac and cheese, even when it's not that good it's still pretty good (kinda like pizza), but they had so much truffle oil on this stuff that it was gross and inedible. The pesto flatbread was pretty boring and uneventful, also unfulfilling. The lamb was good.  Pros: Drinks were strong, everyone was friendly, food came out in a fairly timely manner.  Cons: Food wasn't very good. Tons of open tables with no parties being sat and can't sit in bar area even though you're drinking. Everything was pretty pricey for tapas style small plates. I don't mind paying a premium for good stuff, but not for heavy handed, over seasoned stuff.  We probably won't be eating here again, too many other places to try."}

The fried chicken skin seemed a little on the burnt side of fried. The roasted beets were well seasoned and tasty with crumbled blue cheese but were unevenly cooked with some pieces undercooked and crunchy, and some perfectly cooked. And the mushroom flatbread should be called vegetable flatbread since there were other veggies (asparagus and broccoli) in equal parts to the mushrooms; this overall was a little bland and could use some kind of seasoning, maybe some garlic or spices.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "A cautiously optimistic 3 stars, since CK has only been open a week and we only tried four dishes; but there is much to be excited about here. The space itself is rather small, with communal/bar seating taking up the majority. Does anyone actually like communal dining? Its a hip concept on paper, but no thanks to being seated across from the group of six dudes making their slow, loud, boozy departure. I take it more space will be opening up in the courtyard and ceiling patio eventually? Here's hoping. The old hotel has some great little nooks and crannies, worthy of becoming a go-to late-night hangout.    From greeting through to bill payment, service was friendly and attentive. Our server (Vicky I think?) offered just the right mix of good cheer without being cloying. The only little hiccup was a lengthy wait for our last dish, maybe ten or so minutes, but we didn't feel neglected and weren't in a rush so no harm done. In general, the atmosphere was festive and inviting. Great energy.   Our dishes were 1. Spuds/Sprouts Hash; 2. Veal Meatballs; 3. Wellington Empanadas; and 4. Chicken Thighs with Chimichurri. The first dish was far and away the least successful of the group, and was actually quite disappointing. In flavor, texture and even color everything was monochromatic. The spuds weren't fully cooked. The dish was heavy, brown, and muddled. The meatballs came next, and were a revelation. They were tender and moist with a rich, dark outer crust, and the foie/sherry cream sauce was divine; especially the bright notes of sherry, which cuts through and elevates the otherwise heavy combination. Not sure how necessary the 9 stray peas are though. Third came the empanadas, with a gorgeous buttery/flakey crust and moist and tender filling. The accompanying gravy seemed to be made from a demi-glace, as it was layered with all kinds of delightful colors; problem was it was face-scrunchingly salty. Rarely is over-salting an issue in restaurants, but this was put-down-your fork salty. Finally came the chicken thighs, which I was overjoyed to see on the menu. Thighs are the best and most tragically ignored part of the bird, and CK knows this and gets it right. Boneless and slightly flattened, they are the perfect combination of moist and juicy meat with cracklingly crunchy skin. Just like God intended. The Chimichurri is a brilliant accompaniment, full of brightness and acidity, but once again it was over-salted. The sauce man needs to take it down a few notches. The chimi wasn't as excessive as the gravy but it was still distracting. Nevertheless, I loved the thighs. The juicy-crispy combo reminded me of my favorite dish at Raku, juicy deep fried chicken--so bravo and thanks, CK!   I live down the street and am thrilled to have CK in the neighborhood. I'll be back soon to further explore the menu and enjoy the historic space."}

The atmosphere is great, the service is great, but the food is just OK.  The food isn't bad, but I was hoping for much better.  I had the chicken skins, which were deliciously unhealthy.  The skins were crispy and delicious, but I didn't care for the smoked honey dipping sauce.  No idea how you smoke honey, but the smokiness left a weird after-taste that lasted far too long.  I also had the tempura green beans, which came out pretty crispy, considering how much water green beans have in them.  Paired with a pepper cream cheese, the beans were probably the best dish of the night.  The black rice oxtail risotto wasn't to my liking - a little too oily and definitely too salty.  Even though I have a wicked sweet tooth, I actually found the sweet potato pie (with pecans and a stout-laced marshmallow browned topping) too sweet.  I liked what they were trying to do here, an interesting spin on every dish, but the execution was off just enough that I can't rave about the place.  That said, I will probably come back here.  I loved the atmosphere, the staff is super nice and friendly (one of the chefs started chatting with me while he was working), and the food is light-years better than most offerings Downtown (damning with faint praise, I know). Plus I thought the prices were pretty reasonable. So I can't say I'm dying to come back here, but I'll probably have another meal or two at Carson Kitchen."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "This past Sunday evening my husband and I decided to take his parents here after we had a great experience a few months ago; that was an HUGE mistake and embarrassment.  We called to make a reservation around 6:30 and were told they don't take them for less than 6 people but, if we were headed there soon it wouldn't be a problem as they weren't busy. The lady told us to just call when we got close and they'd make sure there was a table available. We immediately hopped in the car and called as instructed only to be told there was now an hour wait. What??? She indicated to still come and it shouldn't really be that long.  We arrived, gave our name and waited in their back yard. As we waited and waited, we witnessed a hostess seat a party of 4 that did not have all of their diners with them but, she told them that was fine. What?? Since we had our entire very hungry party ready, my husband went to ask the hostess what was up with that. She did agree that all members of the party need to be present before seated but, did not ask the 2 men to wait back outside until everyone arrived. Instead she told us it shouldn't be much longer. Frustrated, we waited some more (about a total of an hour) until finally being seated on their wobbly little stools.  The food was good, the waitress was nice but, the real kicker was when the bill came. I normally quickly look at a bill and pay it but, this time I noticed my husband's soda water was $12 (we were charged every time she refilled it), 2 orders of tiny tacos were over $30 and even more insulting a charge for more tiny pieces of toast (more=maybe 4 slices).   I called over the waitress to ask about primarily the ridiculous amount for soda water and she at that time told us it's because it's from a bottle. What? We weren't told it was a bottle when we ordered it nor did a bottle come to the table like my father-in-law's coke. She said she'd ask her manager about adjusting it. A male manager came over that was strangely confrontational and beyond rude for such a situation, explained the whole bottle thing and would be able to take 2 of the charges off (there were 4 total). I told him that was unacceptable as we were never told we were ordering a bottle to begin with much less each time the waitress automatically refilled it. I also informed him that our experience had started off horrible, that we are locals entertaining our parents. **This is also the time I signaled our parents to leave** He seemed to be deaf to our concerns as his demeanor never changed and no apologies were given. He told us fine but, you'll still have to pay for one.   Now Folks, you may be asking B**ching about soda water? Really? Yes, because I have ZERO tolerance for liars and scammers (even here in Vegas)!  Due to his lack of customer service as a manager, he could care less about us nor our horrible experience. He adjusted the bill and came back silent. NEVER EVER apologizing. However, I did hear him ask the table behind us if everything was ok and if they needed anything.  This place is a complete joke. It belongs on The Strip where they can get away with overcharging and nickeling and diming guests or at the very least rethink their business practice that currently has a total lack of customer care."}

Either way we're we're served well, except for the fact my lady noticed the manager continuously stare at us from afar. He finally came up to us and asked if our guest was going to arrive. As soon as we said no, he grabbed the napkins and place settings with such a bad attitude and walked away without a word.   We had our meals but we're still annoyed and Mike kept leering at us. Finally, we got our check and we're about to pay when he, grabbed the check out of our servers hands. He came back and stated, I took care of the appetizer, thanks for understanding and we needed you to get up quickly!    Wtf? Like really? You could of kindly asked us to sit at the bar or another small table, and we would have been good but the way the manager Mike, handled himself was completely unprofessional, offensive, and rude as fuck.

The bacon jam tasted good but visually was not appealing due to its blackish color (and even a little gross because it was marinating in its fat).  The lamb in the gyros were dried out, so much so that even the yogurt sauce didn't cover up the dryness. The pita bread was moist and tasty though, and I have to wonder whether this would do better as a vegetarian dish.  The two dishes I really enjoyed were the Cuban (although did it really need to be pork belly?) and the mac and cheese. Both were flavorful and moist.  However, I can't in good conscious give more than 3 stars since this was only half the dishes, and I can't imagine the calories cost to achieve those flavors.  I can't ignore that the mac and cheese probably was a very fattening dish (so much so that one of my fellow diners could not finish the small dish). I can't ignore that the Cuban had 2 very thick slices of cheese on 2 buttered slices of toast. Just because I choose to eat out doesn't mean I want to eat a more than 1000 calorie meal.

Our server was amazing- made helpful recommendations about dishes to try, how much to order, cleared plates in a way that was efficient, but didn't make us feel like we were being rushed out the door. Definitely 5 star staff. The food was OK, but the menu didn't offer many vegetarian options, so probably not a place I would come back to, but everyone else seemed to like it.  We ordered a ton, probably a bit too much for a group of 7... - Deviled eggs- Four halves = $11. These were nice a creamy with a bit of space and some type of meat on top - Roasted beets- ($11) YUM! - Caesar salad- ($12) fine with a good dressing, but on the small side - Lamb tacos 3 small street-style size = $12, add one more for $4- I thought just OK, but you shouldn't take my word for it since I'm not a big lamb eater and definitely don't prefer ground meat - Baked mac and cheese ($12)- didn't really love this. It was nice and creamy, but wasn't very hot and had truffle oil that seemed too strong - Rainbow cauliflower- ($9)- I love cauliflower and am sad to say this is the first cauliflower dish I think I've ever ordered out and not enjoyed. I didn't care for the strong vinegar flavor - Wild mushroom flatbread ($14)- meh. The pickled onions were nice, but I didn't care for the tuffle oil  Other things that we ordered, I didn't try, but they seemed to be crowd pleasers with my dinner companions: - Bacon jam with brie ($13). Pro tip, save some to eat with the mac and cheese - Veal meatballs- ($14) - Pig & Fig flatbread- ($13) - Black Mussels- ($14) - Short rib grilled cheese with tater tots ($14) - NY strip($20)  Overall, would say service is great. Menu just not my style of food."}

I asked for a med rare steak, i got it medium, bacon jam was too sweet, i couldn't find the cocoa-expresso in my steak, and the mac and cheese was too garlicky, and my mom's blackened catfish sandwich was bland. My dad's trout and cauliflower on the other hand was pretty well made, and the veel meatballs were sort of springy tasting so that was nice and the bourbon brownie was good with the icecream.  But considering you pay 30 to 50 per person it was too expensive for food that i consider nice but not that nice."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "This is the problem with the 'new downtown.' The attitude of these new business owners is abhorrent. They come here to Vegas, full of pompous flatulence. They believe that since they are new and hip, that the general public should bend over and keep their mouth shut.  Yes, you did invite me to go into further detail. However, unlike you, (whom I was well aware of your presence while we dined because you sat right behind us), I have my own business to run.I also advised you that as soon as I had a chance I would be more than happy to discuss. I was there only 2 days ago.   I am a Vegas native, born and raised. In fact, my family opened one of the first ethnic restaurants here in the late 50's. I grew up working there so I know a little about the food industry.  So, here are the issues in greater detail.  We arrived at approximately 13:45. We were a party of 6. Upon stepping in, we were greeted with several looks of disdain. The what the hell do these people want look of disdain. However, the subsequent customers that walked in were greeted with smiles. I guess I should have come in my skinny jeans and plaid shirt.  Once we were greeted by your hostess, we had requested the table in the corner to avoid the sun. We were told that that table was unavailable. (Come to find out it was unavailable because you were going to sit there).   We sat down at the table directly behind the hostess stand. The waitress did not come greet us until approximately 5 minutes after we sat down. At which time she asked us if we were ready to order. We stated not yet as we just had  sat down. She took our  drink order ( Three waters, no ice. Three waters with ice with lemons. One cup of coffee and an iced tea.   She returned with four glasses of water, two with and two without ice. No lemons. Coffee and iced tea were delivered (without accompaniments) She asked again whether we were ready to order again. To which we stated we would like more time. Her face expression at that moment was best described as utter contempt. Then she just stood there at the table with that same look which she shared with another staff member as they walked by.  To attempt on getting her to not stand there, my colleague and sister both asked the waitress (Paige-according to my bill) for sweetener for my father's iced tea and cream for my aunt's coffee. To which she replied, sweetener? Oh yeah, we have that. Then it took a good three seconds for her to physically react. As she reached for the sweetener caddy, she remarked, oh, we have syrup too. She proceeded to as your bartender for the syrup where I overheard her ask for the 'simple syrup.' My sister said, oh, that's nice but is it Agave syrup, because my dad is diabetic. Waitress handed the syrup to my sister stammering something about , yeah it is... it's syrup... yeah it's  AH GAH BAY... uh yeah it's mixed in there.  My sister inspected it and it appeared to be simple syrup. Coupled with the waitress' response, I told my sister not to give it to my dad and to not trust her statement.  Then we indicated we were ready to order. We ordered the broccoli crunch, gyro tacos, deviled eggs and the chicken skins. She asked us if we were ready to oder our entrees to which we replied, yes.  My dad ordered the Chicken Thighs. My sister added three more orders of the Thighs to cover my aunt, colleague, and mother. My sister proceeded to ask about the oxtail risotto about what it's like. Waitress responded, it's good... as though she wasn't so sure herself. At that point, supervisor,? manager? walked over to waitress and whispered something to her. She then in turn stated, almost accusatorially, the manager just told me we are out of the chicken thighs.  oh ok.  What else do you want to order? To which we all said, since there are no thighs, we would like a few more moments to look at our options. She huffed and walked away. She proceeded to step away and stand at the hostess table occasionally glaring back at the table as if we had done something wrong.   Once our food order was placed, you and your colleagues sat behind us. Your food arrived very quickly. Ours didn't. As I stated in the prior review, one bite of Chicken Skins told me that the lack of proper flavoring was compensated by immersion of MSG.   The risotto was a gloppy tasteless mess. My dad stated, they must've just waved the oxtail over this mess. I can't taste anything that resembles oxtail in it.  The deviled eggs were runny and small. The butter burger had no real flavor but for the fancy cheese that was on it. The flatbreads were average in flavor and taste.   The short rib sliders were overcooked and very small.   At no time did our waitress come to check on us after the food was delivered nor were our drinks refilled.   I wrote the prior review as I sat there and watched you and your staff react to it. Only problem was that nothing was done for your diners that were there.  'Thoughtful' enough for you?"}

I didn't want anything because of it, but mentioned it to the manager AND the waiter, as they both were at the table asking about our experience when it happened.  Neither responded, except for asking if I was done with the plate.  Plus, we waited 45 minutes for a table , while there was two 'reserved' tables. Neither was occupied when we left 1 1/2 hours later. It is a small, cozy place, but they kept saying we couldn't sit at the tables for 4 when we only had three people in our party. The ironic thing was we were seated eventually seated on a table for 6.   I'll probably return, but I'll not go on weekends or holidays. Maybe it's the extra pressure, or something, but I might go back again weekdays."}

A big group of us were exploring Fremont Street so we decided to stop by here based on Yelp reviews. I didn't realize it was such a small and intimate restaurant. We were escorted on their outside lawn which is filled with lawn chairs and some tables while the waiter asked the owner if there would be seating available for us. We were wondering if we could sit outside and eat but someone from Carson Kitchen came out and told us that he could split our party up and accommodate our large party as long as we finish by a certain time due to a reservation. We all agreed but then he said that they couldn't split checks. The could only split in groups of 3's. My friend asked why and the he simply stated because it's our policy. My friend was curious and asked again why is this the policy since they could obviously split checks but it could only be done in 3's, he replied again in a rude tone because it's our policy. I think we all would have agreed even with this interesting 'policy' but we were just wondering why. We were here for a conference so we needed our receipts to be itemized and separate. We did not need someone from the staff to be rude to prospective customers. I'm sure the food is great, but this man needed an attitude check if he thinks he's the reason for the success of this restaurant. We ended up leaving through the back, we didn't need someone to be so condescending to us. Sad I missed out on what seems to be an amazing food experience but we as a group felt like we were disrespected.  The owner contacted me after my review and was extremely apologetic about this situation. I hope this issue will be resolved so that others won't have the same experience we did. The owner also invited us back to actually enjoy the food. I'll be sure to come back with a smaller party the next time I'm in Vegas."}

He was not a fan of the communal seating, especially with the two elderly gentleman and their escorts attempting to carry on conversations. Ordered a round of drinks and ordered the short rib sliders with tater tots and the mac and cheese (which the server proclaimed was LIFE CHANGING-you have to have it . Place was freezing so the wait seemed to be longer than it probably was. a chef and maybe a manager were arguing with the bartender about her ringing an order up incorrectly , fine I get it but really in front of the guests?  Sliders looked good, mac and cheese looked good. He grabbed a slider and one bite he was done. The braising in rootbeer is great, but there is NOTHING on the thing to counteract the sweetness. The tater tots were way way overcooked to the point there was no white in the middle. The mac and cheese while decent, was no where near life changing I spent years in DC if you want life changing mac and cheese go to Cafe Delux in DC. he had been excited to try the bourbon brownie. But instead we left most of the sliders, half the mac and cheese and two half full drinks and went elsewhere for drinks and dessert."}

The chicken skins were very tasty and it's a novel concept I've seen nowhere else, literally just chicken skins deep fried. We had the grilled cheese with short rib it was unremarkable .. the tots were good. The tacos were boring and the devil eggs were about on par with something you'd expect a friend to bring to a Christmas party when they're making them for the first time. I had huge hopes for this place and that could be tainting my review But their yelp rating was through the roof and I definitely did not enjoy it. The bill with tip came to about a buck 128 for four people and if I had any inkling that this was going to be the case there's no way in hell I would've gone.

This was my second time having a late lunch here. This time around the bartender seemed to be the waiter at all the tables so he was needless to say very busy we were created and seated promptly by the hostess. As we sat the bartender is passing behind us and mudders to hisself f@$k, I'm guessing because he was so busy. The hostess got us some waters and said that the waiter would be with us. About 5 minutes pass and he comes by says hello and asked if we were ready.   I ordered an iced tea and the other person with me asked for raspberry iced tea he responded in an almost annoyed fashion I don't have raspberry iced tea, so we order lemonade. We order a starter and two other main dishes.   The shrimp platter came out first which was a main dish followed about 3 minutes later with the gyro tacos which was the starter and then about 5 minutes later the turkey burger which was the other main dish. Seems the waiter should ask and deliver instructions to the kitchen so guests get the food as they are expecting.   My main concern was the hygiene the hostess was trying to help out the waiter by delivering some food and helping with drinks however the almost to the crotch shorts seemed to be causing her a problem so she had to keep reaching to her inner thigh and pulling them down. The other was which seemed to be a manager figure wearing a button down shirt and sweatpants, he would play with his mustache and sole patch rub his eyes and face then grab a plate from the kitchen and deliver it to a table. The other lady at the kitchen counter did a good job as well as the kitchen staff. The other manager figure there delivered one of our plates to us and was very professional.   The food is a little over priced however great marks on flavor so great job to the kitchen staff.   The employees and managers should be a little more mindful of cleanliness.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "We arrived at Carson's Saturday afternoon after searching for it as we drove down Carson Street. The resturant is situated in the Old John Carson Hotel.  You have to look for it. The name is located on the lower part of the window in black letters, hard to distiguish with the glare from the sun. We entered  Carson's K and there were a few people there and it was nice a quiet. The place is nicely decorated and we like the mixture of woods, metal and tile work. The kitchen is open which I liked but the tables are mostly big tables that I assume you would share with other people you do not know if your party is only two people. That would not be so bad if the stools were not so close together. I am have wide shoulders and so does my partner and to be honest, it is not comfortable if you are paying for an experience.  I like experiences but not if I am being intruded by people who are sitting right on top of me.   We sat in at a table across from the bar with a view of the old Post Office. We were immediately greeted by our server who was friendly and listed all of the foods that we had questions about. She took our drink order and after some time we ate our first choice,  the Crispy Chicken skins......Ok, we normally do not eat skin, but this was pure heaven. They were crisp and perfectly seasoned. I like the honey sauce that came along with it.   A short time later, our orders arrived:  me the Fried Green Tomato with lump crab ravigote. It was great. I wish there more tomatoes on it. The tomatoes were lightly breaded and fried.  PERFECT!!!!  Kerry, tell the cooks to put more on there. The tator tots were crispy and fresh and not as greasy as I thought they would be.   My other half had the Butter Burger with boursin and chedder. The cheese was a little too heady (spelling?) and it did not taste so hot. The burger itself was good. It was not dry and had a great flavor to it. My partner ate it all up after scraping the cheeses off.   Our services was good, not great.  Our drinks were never refilled or were we asked if we wanted more to drink....bad!!!  When I go out, I want service, not half hearted, come on strong them leave me waiting. That is not a way to win a repeat. Aside from that, everything else was good. I am not sure if we will be back. The place is small and I can not imagine how crowded it must get at night.  I wonder why they did not build a larger space.   FOOD:                A ATMOSPHERE: A SERVICE:          C PRICE:               B the portions are enough if you are starving."}

We called ahead to see the wait time and they said they could put our name on the wait list for a table and I told them we'd be there in an hour. There was a terrible accident blocking streets around the restaurant so I called to tell them we would be 10 mins late. They said that was perfectly fine.   When we arrived the manager chastised me and told me I can only call 15 mins ahead. I apologized and he continued on about how rude that was literally rolling his eyes as we talked. Then he dismissed us and said he we would have to wait 30 minutes. There were open tables sitting there and they wouldn't seat us. Finally I asked the waitress (who was very sweet) if we could be seated (after waiting for 30 mins) and the manager came over, acted like he was doing a us a favor and said he'd make an exception and seat us.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Visiting Vegas from out of town. After a long day at the Grand Canyon tour we wanted something good to eat but off the strip. So a Google search and Yelp search brought us here. I saw Yelp said it wasn't good for kids but I always caution that recommendation as I feel people lend towards a no go for kids if the place also has full bar. So I called talked to the hostess and said hey is there formal dining seating that would be appropriate for me to bring my teenage daughter and whether the place was kid friendly - hostess said yes definitely.    We took a lyft there and drove by it twice. The place is hard to find and Yelp says 124 but door says 100. Got in there and place is way smaller than I imagined. Then the seating isn't that formal. We were seated at an extension of the bar with other patrons. It was a high table top. I asked if we could change and per the hostess they had nothing else - disappointed in this aspect. In true hipster fashion form preceded function as seating layout is below average (and I'm a millennial so it's not like I'm a old head who doesn't understand).  Due to the seating layout I wouldn't recommend this place for children - which is fine but it would have been nice to been informed that on the phone when I inquired. Decor was nice.   Drinks - my aunt and I can ordered bar drinks - wine for aunt, mixed for me. Drinks were great, expensive but I think the environment/location warranted it. Nothing too crazy.   Appetizers - Burnt Ends and Deviled Eggs. Burnt ends were good, BBQ sauce a little too sweet but overall really good,I'd order again. Bread that came with it was not really edible, kind of stale. Deviled eggs had crispy pancetta and caviar on them. Pancetta was too crispy like a hard bacon bit, it would have been better if it had a little more give to it. The caviar didn't really add much of anything, the filling was good.   Entrees - we all ordered the butter burger. Burger was good and butter taste was phenomenal. The sharp cheese wasn't melted on burger and wasn't the right type of cheese for a burger, they also gave two slices of cheese which was way too much for a sharp cheese andthat was the only disappointing factor. Spicy tots weren't spicy but they were yummy.   Service - service was slow but people were personable in there.   Next time I'm in Vegas I wouldn't come back but glad I tried it.

It had a great menu of interesting and flavorful new American foods so it was a lot more exciting than eating at your regular old vegas buffet. We came in around 7pm and the wait was 30 minutes and they offered to put us up in the shared patio to wait but since it's just a block off of Fremont st and Container Park, it was a nice opportunity to walk around. We came back with time to spare so checked out the patio and it was okay. Glad we got a seat inside because it was 100 degrees. We ordered the crispy chicken skin and rainbow cauliflower to start, turkey burger and trout for our entrees, and the banoffee pie for dessert. The things I would recommend were the caulliflower, turkey burger (it comes with tater tots that are pretty good), and banoffee pie (it comes in a little jar). The chicken skin was a little overdone, though it was a nice crunch to add to the fish. The fish portion was just too small, though well cooked. I really like the turkey burger, which was well-seasoned, and the banoffee had so much delicious graham cracker crust it was the best thing we ate there. The waitress was okay. She was the type of waitress that would say a dish was her favorite thing in the world simply because you pointed it out. Then we saw her say something similar about another dish to a nearby customer. She made the mistake of giving us one glass of water and saying that there were no clean water glasses, which didn't make any sense since we could see several behind the bar.

We were told the chicken would come the latest but after a long wait anyway the flatbread arrived 15 minutes after the first dish of mains is served after stating clearly we were not sharing. That's simply not acceptable.  I will not return to this restaurant despite having friends in the area."}

Try their supremely burned bacon jam or the overpriced cocktails that you get hassled for sending back because the bartender learned how to make drinks at margaritaville. I returned a drink because i asked for it to be not so sweet but this thing was drowning in sweet n sour mix. Returned it, then waited 30 minutes for THE EXACT SAME DRINK to be poured in a different glass and they thought i wouldnt notice. Yeah i noticed, but im done making a damn scene over a bad cocktail. Screw this place. Jerkoff staff, rude hostesess (made snyde remarks to both myself and my father in law), and supremely overpriced for what you get.

Initially, we were seated at a high top table with strangers.  I didn't want my neighbors to hear our conversation; so we asked to move.  No problem said the hostess.  We struggled to find something to order off the menu.  Tried the bacon jam since it has gotten rave reviews.  It was okay--not something to write home about.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich.  Hated the spread on the sandwich and not impressed with the chicken.  Enjoyed the tater tots.  My friend ordered the beef stroganoff.  Neither one of us finished our meal and we both declined to have any of it boxed up.  $50.00 not well spent for today's lunch.  Carson Kitchen is busy; so I doubt they will be missing our business in the future.  It's a hip place, but I'd rather be well fed and square."}

Coolest thing about the restaurant is the resto itself and the location its in. Great bar!  The neighborhood is in a revamped area of old town Vegas and the building itself is a renovated hotel where other businesses share office space. They string up lights outside in the patio with a nice little fire pit.   BUTTER BURGER - $14 (2.4/5) - The handful of tater tots were good. Ordered the burger medium rare and it came out tough, chewy, more like a well kneaded meatloaf burger. Not really buttery or juicy, on the smaller side. Should rename it the MEH-tloaf burger. Didn't think there was alot of value or anything special about it.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I post this review with mix emotions, I love eating here ever since I found it on a weekend getaway. We have come back many times with fam/friends. I also refer others (blogging, IG, FB), (Love Bacon Jam). With that said I feel a little gouged. Let me explain; I thought it would be a perfect place to host a bachelor party dinner (patio). So I went ahead to set up for a dinner at 8 pm. But as u know it's hard to wrangle up 12 guys from drinking, napping, and gambling. So I called to say I was running late, they said that was fine. So we had a good dinner. Then we got the catering bill, and then I noticed an additional charge of $300. I was like shocked. The manager said your party was charged $150 for every 30 mins past the reservation which was noted in the catering contract. Totally my fault for not getting the group there on time (and for not reading the details of the contract). But then I reviewed the bill, and I noticed the bill had a time stamp of 10:39 pm, Our reservation was to be from 8-10pm. So I was puzzled when I was charged 2 increments. Come Monday when I had a chance to recover from Vegas (getting too old for this stuff), looking back on the event, I was left to wonder if those additional 9 mins were totally attributed to us and only us? I recalled several possible factors that could have contributed to those extra 9 mins. Here are some that stuck out in my mind. 1) Even thou the waiter was nice, he did go on some long stories about his life in Las Vegas, fine...nice guy but let's get the food out. 2) Waiter decides to hold some food from the table until we finish other appetizers, which we had plenty of room for the food for the table plus with that many guys we would go through everything quickly, no need to wait, but to go back and forth from the stairs takes time. 3) The waiter was nice of enough to bring us extra desserts for us to consume even thou we were already done with dessert,(added time to our event). 4) When fixing the bill, he rang up the alcohol on the catering bill we had said to leave it on a separate check, so the waiter had to go back and adjust the bill. then I get the bill at 10:39. So what I am trying to say is those extra 9 mins could have been caused by many factors that we were not in our control/fault. I called the Carson kitchen later that week. Again everyone was courteous and professional. The GM heard me out, and I explained to him the situation like I stated above. He said he would take this back to the owner (Cory H) because he would ultimately have the final word. I mention again that I'm not looking for a full refund just a partial refund or maybe even a credit for next time. But from the some of the conversation with the managers at the restaurant and over the phone it seemed that the reason they were charging me was because they have been burn before. It seemed to me, Carson Kitchen wanted to punish us for being late and for staying over our time. So which is it then, are you charging us for being late or having the party go past the time or both? Because the contract makes it seem, I should have only been charged for each 30 minutes past my time and not for showing up late (which you guys made it seem, for both). It almost seems that it was out of anger or resentment for past situations with other customers, and I was told any chance of a refund would mean that they would be taking a loss. Which I totally understand why I was charged for the 1st 30 mins (would I have been charged at 10:01pm if I came at 8pm?)...and far as a lost...I mean it's not like I consumed $150 worth of food and then I asking for a refund for that...this is 9 mins we are talking about that could have been caused by Carson kitchen staff or us. In the end, $150 would not have bankrupted Carson kitchen or myself or created anarchy among other patrons. I think the compromise or gesture from Carson Kitchen would have been nice, it would have garnered so much more effort from me to post on yelp about the situation in a more positive manner than I am now. This situation has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I found myself hard to recommend this place without letting them know about this incident (I really did like this place). I truly believe in the power of 5, 1 person will tell 5 other people and those other 5 people will tell 5 other people, but in today's age with media, it's more like 1 person tells thousand other people and so on. I appreciate Matt's effort to speak to the owner and even offer me a drink to bury the hatchet the next time I'm in town. But what I really want to ask Cory H was that $150 charge for 9min worth alienating a frequent customer? Again thank you, Matt and Julie, for being understanding and handling our business. I give the food 4 stars, standard service 3 stars but catering operation 1 stars. Total 8 stars divided by 3 categories = 2.6 avg stars (just in case you wondered how I came up with that rating.

On a Sunday night all of the menu items I was interested in were out. The Sea Bass, NY strip Steak, and Pork Chop. That is the entire Meat and Sea food section. I asked if I could get the pork belly flat bread without the Pickled Figs and the chef refused to do so. Not much of a problem if i was explained as to the reason. Instead the waiter told me that he begged the chefs to remove the pickled figs, but they were insulted and couldn't do it. Very disappointed. Also be aware of small portions and a hefty price tag for what they are delivering. The rest of my party enjoyed their meal, maybe i caught them on a bad night.  Either way, i will not return or suggest this restaurant. Thank you to our waiter who did try his best for us."}

So here is what happen, after waiting more then an hour for our table were ed, pretty stoked to be seated and enjoyed our waiters. After a min or two my wife noticed a huge amount of hair in her water, literally a huge amount of it almost looked like a dreadlock I mean you could have made a freaking carpet out of the amount of hair in her glass. So naturally I told our waitress, she directly got the manager. The manager didn't even really try to apologize his words exact words were, I'll get you guys a desert or something the thing he gave us was the cheapest and most greasiest appetizer on the menu (fried chicken skin). You would think, after that happened a manager would try to make sure we had a good evening and would check on us frequently, but no (they even charged us $1 for the extra bread). When we paid he was no where to be found. We were charged the full amount!  To be honest this is the first review I have ever written here and this is only because I am freaking mad at this place and the so called manager person. We saw him on the street when we walked out and instead of saying anything he looked on the ground and walked pass us and pretended he didn't know us. The sad part is we used to really like this place but after what happen today this place is dead to us. My whole life I grew up in restaurants, point being I know service and this is the first time in my life I have never tipped."}

Was told dishes are shared, or can be shared but i don't see how as they're standard sized. If i shared a burger or my sandwich I'd still be hungry.

Our waitress (who in all honesty seemed to be having a rough night) was crass, overly familiar, and inattentive. The food was almost inedibly over-seasoned, and for our $100 tab, the only saving grace was the booze.   We tried the crispy green-beans (good), the chicken skins (awful. so over-seasoned and chewy), the steak (cooked okay but drowning in what tasted like soy sauce), and the cauliflower (inedible. seriously the lemon was so strong it burned).  My boyfriend made the observation that this place really wants to do fine, innovative dining, but had absolutely no idea how to go about it. Our grumpy waitress made a few off-hand comments about trouble in the kitchen and how this place sucks, so perhaps our experience was the result of a truly awful night.

We ended up ordering Chicken Skins, ok but I'm not a big fan. Although they were better with the Bacon Jam, which was also good.    We also tried the Shrimp Dunderi, Gnocchi made from Ricotta cheese instead of potatoes, it was also very tasty and the Shrimp were huge but you get two...keep that in mind if you are splitting.     All in all I thought it was just 'ok' nothing to brag about or write home about, it was pretty pricy in my opinion but I may not have felt that way if I really, really thought the food was to die for.

The others in my party ordered the bacon jam, the sliders, and gyro tacos, and they even comped us a free Mac n Cheese because they brought a plate out late.  Everything was pretty enjoyable overall.  My one complaint would be the tater tots.  They are seasoned very heavily, almost overkill.  The beer menu was a little different as well, probably could be expanded upon to better match and compliment the food flavors.

TJ refused to try it because she said it looked gross.  My friend TJ's bill was $33 and she ordered: - 2 sunrise beers ($9 for 2) - cauliflower - looked like a jumbled bowl of steamed colorful cauliflower.

Two friends and I came here for lunch and decided on a handful of dishes that looked interesting.  Cheddar Crab Fondue ($11): Served with a variety of carbohydrate vehicles - pretzel bread, cheese crisps, and baguette - that all worked well with the cheese. The group favorite was the pretzel. This is a really great dip/spread.  Bacon Jam ($12) with baked Brie and toasted baguette. There is so much buzz around this jam, so of course I had to try it. The sweet and salty bacon jam with Brie is good, but not my thing. Also, there is not nearly enough baguette for the amount of spread - it is so rich that you don't need very much of it. We asked for more bread (an extra $1 for a few slices).  Devil's Eggs ($8) with crispy panchetta and caviar. I believe the term caviar is used loosely here as I'm certain the fish roe on our deviled eggs were not from sturgeon, but rather black tobiko (flying fish roe). The deceitful description is very disappointing, especially because these eggs were really delicious.   Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto ($14) with Parmesan cream. This is a beautiful and fun dish. I didn't absolutely love the flavor, but there's a comfort factor that I enjoyed.  Roasted Young Beets ($9): Pistachio, orange, and goat cheese.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "So, as a Las Vegas local, my friend and i decided to go to Downtown Las Vegas to support local business and to try something new. Per Yelp recommendations and the recognition of the name Carson Kitchen by previous friend posts on social media we decided to try it out. We walk into the establishment's front door and no one was there to greet us at all. About 3-4 minutes of standing by the door, the male employee with the mustache who, as it seemed, was controlling all the order tickets, turned around and recognized my friend and i and said be right with you guys and we acknowledged with an ok. A few minutes later, a couple walks in and stands just off to our right in which a caucasian make employee with a beard, wedding ring, and a pink jelly bracelet on his right wrist acknowledges them right away and recommends that they go to the bar and wait and he'll call them in about 20 minutes or so. Doesn't even look at my friend and i and offer the same accommodations and walks away, the 2 of us still standing by the front door with menus in hand so that we can order as soon as we get sat as the place closes in about 40 minutes. A female employee then approached us and asks if she can put us on the waitlist. Didn't even know there was one. I say ok and mention about how the guy with the beard totally ignored us. She apologized and offered us to wait at the bar... well guess what?! the couple who came in after us and WASNT ignored got the last two seats. Lucky us right? So then the guy with the beard takes over and puts our name on the waitlist. Again offers the bar or the back courtyard to wait. Well, can't do the bar so we walked to the back courtyard where i quickly jumped on Yelp! to find an alternative establishment in which to support local. Found Park on Fremont and the girls at the front were super friendly, accommodating and we were quickly sat and shortly there after, the server was at the table to take drink and food orders and made awesome recommendations.   You only have one time to make a first impression and sadly, Carson Kitchen just didn't understand that. Again, as a Las Vegas local, i get asked by friend, family, and colleagues for recommendations for food and drink locales as i live here. Carson Kitchen wouldn't not be my first, second, third, fourth or even 50th choice just because of the way my friend and i were treated. Again, you have one time to make a first impression, and to say the least, i felt as if my friend and i didn't exist as opposed to the other 2 who walked in after us.   Don't waste your time with this place because i certainly will never revisit this establishment and will voice my opinion to other social media outlets such as TripAdvisor, Eater, and other online sources that recommend restaurants."}

The gf and I came here on Friday night just about a week after they opened.  I thought that the service was great.  Our server gave us his recommendations, was very attentive, and he even gave us a quick tour.  As for the food, I enjoyed half of what I had.  I ordered their Wellington Empanada as an app and their Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak as an entree.  The empanada was a little too greasy and pricey at $10 for two small pieces.  The steak cost $18 and I thought it was worth it. It was delicious, sliced, and full of flavor. My gf had their Bacon Jam as an app and their Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto.  I got a little taste and thought both were pretty good.  Again, wasn't a fan of the price of their Bacon Jam, but thought that the entree was just about right.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "This was a big disappointment. We were seated at the bar without being asked when tables were open. The bartender who was our waiter wasn't friendly. When asked questions about the menu the bartender/waiter have smartass answers. We ordered two entrees, both of which had been 86'd because of a new menu coming out next week. That would have been good to know before looking over the menu. We ordered substitute entrees, one of which was also 86'd.  Since they have paper menus it would be very easy to cross out the items that are no longer available if the staff isn't going to tell customers. Our entrees (steak) came out cool, not warm, and the cauliflower side was no where to be seen. We asked about it and the bartender checked with a nearby server who we overheard say that it wasn't put in. The bartender then told us it would just be a minute more because he was just told it hadn't been made. We ate half of our steaks and then waiting for the cauliflower. Our steaks just got colder as we waited. At no point was there an apology or a visit from a manager. The only reason this is getting two stars instead of lower is the quality of the food. I can't recommend this place and won't be back."}

Very relaxing and comfortable wait.  We (4of us)were seated at the eating bar downstairs.  Good seating since it was facing the kitchen so was fun watching the chefs at work.  The staff was great and our server was attentive.  He recommended eating  tapas style; the four of us sharing plates.  Sitting at the bar made that pretty difficult.  We first ordered burnt ends, fried chicken skin and tempura green beans. Unfortunately none lived up to expectation.  The burnt ends were 90% fried fat.  None of us got much meat to speak of.  I'm from barbecue country and know what burnt ends are.  These weren't it.  The chicken  skin was cooked exactly as I expected but way too salty.   The tempura green beans had no tempura batter on them. Some of the beans had a thin layer of batter on them.  They were also a bit greasy.  It was as if the grease was not hot enough when they were cooked.  That being said, the overall texture of the beans was quite good.  Not too under done, not too over done.  To end the meal, we got watermelon salad, mac and cheese, asparagus salad and cauliflower.  All were good.  The two salads were fantastic.  Be prepared to say what did you say a lot.  Very noisy.   I think sitting on the deck upstairs to eat would probably have made the dinner more enjoyable.  All in all, it was a fair experience and wouldn't go back, which pains me to say."}

Veal Meatballs were just OK, nothing special. Macn´Cheese was quite nice. And the grilled cheese sandwich was just OK.  Tables remained empty during the whole stay of our dinner, almost two hours.

Order the mushroom flatbread that is 12 dollars. It was just ok. It did have a lot of ingredients on it. So at least they weren't skipping out. I felt the crust was too soggy in the middle and when you tried pick it up & eat it it would fall apart. And the crust around the outside was super chewy and just did not taste good. One of my other diners got the scallops and it was three tiny scallops for $17. She was a little bit irritated. If it's only going to be 3 scallops then it should at least be the large sea scallops. There are plenty of other places to eat downtown if that's what the price of the scallops are.

I was expecting a creamy base but I received different. The pasta was black, there were tiny pieces of calamari and the base had a strong olive taste. This was an interesting dish and perfect for olive lovers. Was it worth the price I paid? For the portion and quality, eh, I'll pass. I also didn't enjoy the pasta strands clumped together. Makes me question the freshness.   Yelp convinced me to order the glazed donut bread pudding and I was not a happy camper. What's with the hype? I can get a better donut for half the price. It's basically a warm, glazed cake. The warm sauces swimming at the bottom of the plate added value to this dish."}

The burgers were a little under cooked so we sent them back and the waitress informed us that they would make us two fresh burgers. Unfortunately my wife had to go back to work so I paid for both burgers and informed the waitress that I would return to pick them up. When I returned to pick the burgers up I didn't inspect them because I assumed they would be two fresh burgers, not the case! Come to find out the cook took the same two patties that we sent back, that was fully dressed had been cut in half and physically touched by us and placed back on the grill and served back to us. The only difference was the dressing was new. Couldn't very well give us the same dressings,  that would be un professional.  This has to be not only the tackiest but most blatant  disrespect I have experienced at a restaurant. I reached out to the restaurant before writing this review,  and basically was told this is how it's done and is the norm for most eateries. I beg to differ, I can't see Glutton, nor Eat nor any other of the fine restaurants we like to frequent would say this is common practice. The irony of it all is, my wife suggested Glutton but I choose to go to Carson and pay $28 for their butter burger. Never again! My wife also wrote a review and received basically the same response from owner Cory Harwell ( it is what it is ) note, there are over 100 other negative reviews on this restaurant.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "The Skinny: okay - nothing special. Food was bland or very unbalanced(2), service: food came out quickly, only 2 servers in the whole joint made service slow(2), value: overpriced for so-so food and service(2 stars overall).  With the plethora of tapas joints out there, we were interested in trying out Kerry Simon's joint for some comfort/farm to table food.  Of note, they only had 2 servers manning the restaurant. Albeit the restaurant is small, they are able to squeeze quite a few customers on the bar stools (there are about 4 table seats in the restaurant with largely communal/bar seating). Given the number of customers/servers, this poor ratio resulted in slower than expected service.  We ordered the Broccoli Crunch ($8), the Wellington Empanadas ($10), Veal Meatballs in a Foie Gras Sherry Cream ($12) and the Sprouts and Spuds Hash($10). As per our server, she suggested about 2 dishes/person. Serving sizes are typical of a tapas type style restaurant - small.  The broccoli crunch was very bland. Slightly par-boiled to get the rawness out, the broccoli was dressed in a rather runny tasteless version of green goddess dressing. Even the addition of pumpkin/sunflower seeds could not save this dish. Sadly, this was the best dish of the night.  The Wellington Empanadas were again desperately underseasoned. The beef was tough and overcooked. The mushrooms were flavorless. The pastry itself was okay but that alone could not save this dish.  Veal meatballs were okay - nothing special. I would say there was a bit too much breadcrumb in the meatball itself. The selling point was the foie gras sherry cream which disappointed - did not taste the foie gras in the dish at all.  The Sprouts (Brussel) and Spuds (Potato) was overpowered by the rather large dose of balsamic vinegar to the dish. It was so strong that I started coughing due to the potency of the vinegar. It wasn't pleasant and I would definitely not recommend this dish.  After the lackluster dishes we were served, we skipped dessert here and went somewhere else. The level of the cuisine does not match the prices that they charge here.  Given the disappointing array of dishes and slow service makes this place a 2 starred joint."}

Thankfully none of the lettuce spilled out but the lid landed on the floor with the inside flooring facing. He picked it up off the floor and placed the lid on the full tub of lettuce. Not thank you, I refuse to pay $10 for a salad that has sat all day rubbing up against something that fell on the dirty ass floor. I will never return here and need to tell everyone I know to do the same.  UPDATE: they've made certain to threaten me through personal message.

We ordered a few appetizers to share and they all tasted pretty good. They did run out of one item and the nice host did apologize for it. No issues. After we finished the appetizer, we ordered entrees and everything was nicely presented and pretty yummy. Our waitress seemed very absent and I had to ask a couple of times to refill our drinks.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Came here with a group of friends, seven of us total, and had we not made a reservation, it might have been tough to fit, so if you've got a group, think ahead. Disclaimer: I'm vegetarian with an egg allergy, so my access to the menu was pretty limited, and that's all I've got to go on for the review.  The food was decent, but struck me as a bit vinegar-heavy. The dishes were ordered to be shared, and of what was ordered at the table I had the Mushroom Ceviche, the Roasted Young Beets salad, and the Rainbow Cauliflower. I would probably have loved the flatbread and the tempura green beans, but both have egg in them, alas. (And then had to deal with delicious-looking green beans being dangled in front of me because the table ordered not one, but TWO orders of it. It's apparently quite good.) Of what I ordered, the Roasted Young Beets was my favorite, but was similar to roasted beet salads I've had elsewhere. The mushroom ceviche was nice, but a smidge more vinegar-laden than I would have liked, but then again, maybe that's a ceviche thing--I haven't had any previous experience with ceviche, so I had no idea what to expect going into that dish. The Rainbow Cauliflower was oddly and inexplicably vinegar-y tasting when it should have been more lemony, so I'm wondering if maybe having the ceviche where I could smell it was affecting my ability to truly taste it. The cauliflower was ultimately abandoned by the rest of the table in lieu of other things, so it kind of fell flat for us (I finished it anyway, though; I usually love cauliflower).  From what I remember of what the non-vegetarians ordered, they had the Cocoa Espresso NY Strip, the Bone-In Pork Belly, the Tempura Green Beans, the Baked Mac & Cheese, the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto, and I believe an order of The Devil's Eggs. Of these, a second green beans was ordered and the mac & cheese and the risotto disappeared fairly quickly. I seem to recall a lot of anticipation for the pork belly that didn't quite appear to deliver, but I do believe the ones that had the deviled egg liked it. Again, I am not sure. They also got a Bourbon Fudge Brownie to share for dessert, which didn't go over well with the ones that don't appreciate salt in their sweets and weirded out Mr. Piano a little with the bacon ice cream. I'm mostly just mentioning this in case it's helpful; it doesn't make sense to work any of the stuff I couldn't try into my rating.  The service, however, is top notch! Our waitress Felicia was really friendly, great with making recommendations (including recommendations for my dietary restrictions & allergy), and seemed to really enjoy working there, which can be a real breath of fresh air :) She also had some fun recommendations for things to do or see around town, which was nice of her. The setting of the restaurant itself is pretty tastefully done and I like the décor--it's a cute place.  Overall, really awesome service, but they need more (and perhaps better) options for vegetarians/vegans, or they need to make the options that sound like they'd be vegetarian/vegan actually be so. I had previewed the menu before we came, and thought there was more I could eat, like the flatbread. Also, a good traditional tempura batter can easily be vegan, so there's really no reason to have people making sad eyes at crispy, delicious green beans that they can't eat, guys :( I'd probably be okay eating here again if I found myself in Vegas again with friends who wanted to go, but I'd have to have a snack first. Or hit up O-Face Donuts next door immediately afterwards (vegan donuts)."}

We showed up on time and were seated about 20 minutes later. Not a big deal since they had a great outdoor fire lounging area for us.  Once we were seated, our server, I can't remember her name, but she could be Gwen Stefani's sister, seemed on her game and said she won't forget anything because we'll order then she'll repeat it back to us...which she did.  We were warned that food came out randomly about every 6 minutes and they encourage sharing plates. Fine. However, first, not all plates are shareable with 8 people. Sandwiches and burgers and certain salads are not shareable. That being expected is simply ridiculous. Second, Food came out 20,30 and 60 minutes apart. That's insane. The server suggested if we wanted protein in the much talked about Mac n cheese, to add the meatballs. Perfect. So meatballs came out promptly, then the Mac followed about 35-45 minutes later.  YEP. Great recommendation server! To top off the already late dishes, everyone ate except our friend with a chicken salad. First being told the chicken takes a long time to marinate This is almost an hour after originally ordering.  Finally The server said someone forgot and she would comp the salad because she didn't even care  Still, 30 plus minutes goes by without it and I can't help but wonder if it was because the cook was playing finger drums in the back. The salad arrived, we cheered and the hostess seemed annoyed and said frankly, it was because your server forgot to order it. Nice team work! No one takes ownership, just blames or throws you under and made us feel like the jerks because WE should have expected that due to their expediting technique. The infamous salad was wonderful, so our friend said. We left with pleased palates but service was considerably less than our expectations.  If you want good food, go.

Walked up, hostess said it would be a 45 min-hour wait for the first available table and took our phn number down to call us, okay fine no problem we would wait. An hour had passed and had not received a call yet, so I called and there was no answer. We decide to go back, the hostess is frazzled flipping the paper like oh oh, it will be about another 15 mins. So I am assuming she forgot to call us. Okay we decide to wait, but by this point, I am very hungry and irritated. She keeps eyeing some ladies at the bar who is supposedly finishing up their drinks and paying, ok that is fine, but I know when I am somewhere with my girlfriends I hate being rushed so I don't think that was fair to them.  We finally get a seat at the community table which I wasn't a fan of. I ask if there is seating outside and how come people coming after us are able to just go right outside and seat when she told us there were no seats available at all 45 min- hour and clearly a sign that says no persons under 21, but I see a family of 4 going outside with definitely 2 teenagers. I ask to be seating outside, ooh it will be another 15 minutes, but by this time I am overly irritated and hostess can tell so she tells us some seating will be available immediately. At this point, I am no longer interested in eating here so even after placing an order, my boyfriend and I get up and leave. I was sooo over it.  Carson Kitchen came also as a recommendation from a friend who goes here often and already told us great food choices to order so I was pretty excited about it.

Spicy, flavorful, it's a shame there wasn't more of it. The steak was meh, but I appreciated that it was rare, as I requested. The coffee flavor was lost and the reduction was flavorless- making the entire piece of meat unmemorable. I swished the meat around in it a few times to try to find something and got nothing.  If I had a choice, I wouldn't be back. And for the hype this establishment has received, it definitely did not live up to it."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Before going to the Smith Center, we usually try to dine in one of the downtown restaurants. This time we chose Carson kitchen based on the very positive yelp reviews. Ambiance: despite the fact that the address is on 6th street, the entrance to the restaurant is on Carson. There are dining three areas, indoors, the first floor patio, and an upstairs patio. It was 105° and windy the day we ate at Carson kitchen so the two outdoor eating areas were not real option. The indoor eating area is rather stark and very small. We were party of six and ended up sharing a hightop table with a party of two strangers (nice guys). The table right next to us was another party of six. Unfortunately, they were VERY loud, which doesn't do well in a very small room. They really weren't doing anything wrong. It just makes dining very unpleasant when someone is that loud in that small of a room. Service: Chelsea, our server, came to our table almost as soon as we sat down. Since we were first timers, she explained the menu and answered questions and made some suggestions. Very warm and welcoming. Overall, excellent service. Food: We started with shared tempura green beans. Yummm. We also shared the bacon jam. Very tasty. When we ran out of the bread, we ended up putting it on our other dishes (I even ate some straight up - also very good!!) I shared the Margherita Pizza/Flatbread. Excellent!! I also shared the Cocoa expresso NY Strip Steak. Prepared the way we requested but a bit tougher than I like. Just OK. Overall, the service was 5 star, the food 4 star, but the ambiance made the dining unpleasant. Perhaps I will return on a night we can sit out on the upstairs patio and really enjoy the food. But I would not go back when the only option is to dine indoors."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "So I had to try this place out for myself since I had read many of the Yelp reviews. I decided to go for lunch and was pleasantly pleased that the location was right next to the Donut Bar, so I could try out both places. Score!  We were lucky to land a parking spot right in front of the these businesses. Parking is sparse in this area and if you aren't paying attention, you can drive right by.  We walked in and were promptly seated at the bar. I also noticed that there is bar that you can sit at and watch the chefs making your food. For lunch time the place was not busy at all. There were just a few folks gathered around the chefs bar and a few tables were filled. The space is pretty small and intimate. There is also a second level, so perhaps more people were seated upstairs. Our bartender Chris was really helpful and basically explained that their menu changes with each season. The current menu is for spring. He told us that it is better to choose a couple of different items on the menu since the idea is to share the food. We viewed the menu and started with chicken skins, bacon jam and shrimp dunderi. We anxiously awaited the arrival of our food. Well, let me say I made I huge mistake in ordering the chicken skins (I thought I read chicken wings). They were accompanied with a honey sauce which was tasty but the whole skin thing (Yikes) I was not into. Thank goodness the bacon jam made up for it. This dish had carmelized bacon with melted brie and most Yelpers had raved about it.  We spread this delicious combination on the small baguette's they provided and experienced melt in your mouth goodness!  Next came the shrimp dunderi which came with only with two prawns and a ricotta style pasta. This was flavored with limoncello and was delicious. I think they could have spared at least six prawns since the dish ran $14!! This brings my review down to three stars.  Since we were at work we could not imbibe any alcohol although Manny the other bartender did try to tempt us. We received great, personal service which was appreciated by two first time customers.  Unfortunately, time was ticking and we had to get back to work so we were not able to try anything else although there were some other items that looked interesting. I would like to go back and sit at the chef bar as I think it might make the experience more enjoyable."}

The following morning, I called the restaurant and told them what happened and the person answering the phone apologized and took my phone number and said the manager would call me but he hasn't (which is really crummy and a total cop-out on his/her part).  I know things like this happen, but as a business owner myself, I always take responsibility for my product and service and I did deserve a phone call back from the owner/manager so on general principle, I would NEVER recommend supporting this place.

After waiting outside for the restaurant to open, which you could clearly see people (staff) inside by the door and which I had tried to open earlier, no one came to ask if I was waiting or to even acknowledge restaurant was open. I was first in restaurant (with no line at all). The hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar and with no other patrons in there I asked to sit at a table. The manager (man) said they do not seat party's of one. First, no one is at the restaurant and second,  I have seen in past reviews people said sometime multiple parties would have to be seated at a table. I guess I should have known the experience was not going well when there was no line unlike other places close to this one.  The manager did say as I was walking out the door if I was going to leave they could seat me at a table...no thank you I prefer my food with at least decent customer service!!! I will let my local Vegas friends as well as people visiting to go to another place! Update: I was contacted by Cory who was very gracious and apologetic. I want to thank him for his quick response.

My girlfriend and I walked through the door and immediately was looked up and down by the hostess and she simply said you guys can sit at the community table or, the bar we didn't get asked or given the option of a table. We chose the bar because sitting at a random table with other people was not too romantic, nor did I want to meet anyone new that day. At the bar we were never greeted or asked what we would like to drink. The bartender finally walked over 8 steps to us and handed us a menu and walked off, I had to ask someone else that worked there if we could at least get a water.   We were told by the female bartender that everything that is cooked/made to order and meant to share. She also said the food is brought out as it is ready and would not come out at the same time... NOT A PROBLEM! We ordered the Ox tail risotto and a burger. The risotto came out within 10 minutes of us ordering it. Not impressed with the taste and it seemed like it was cooked in a crock pot earlier that morning and NOT MADE TO ORDER. My burger however, is a whole other story. We were done with the risotto within 20+ minutes and still no burger! I asked the bartender if the burger was coming out soon and she said she would go check. She came back and said nothing to us about the burger eta. Then the cook came out and from 15 feet away and within earshot of the whole bar and said 10 minutes on the burger and the bartender turned to us and said it will be right out. Now I've cooked burgers over 1000+ times in my life and if I cooked a burger for 30+ minutes it would come out a hockey puck.   I had enough and stood up and walked out. My girlfriend and I never got an apology or asked if there was something they could do. Horrible service, food sucked (I unfortunately never got to take a bite outta the burger), we will NEVER recommend that horrible place!"}

It's a food running, kitchen execution issue. We were sitting at the bar where we could openly see everything that was happening in the kitchen. My friend ordered sliders with fries and I ordered Mac n Cheese.   Usually at a sit down restaurants where you're paying over $10 a plate, the food comes more or less at around the same time. The sliders came first. Waited 5 minutes, then the server came to ask how everything was. IThis was strange since they could see that I hadn't gotten my dish yet.  After a little while, Mac n Cheese materialized on the pass, but no one was around to run the food to the table. The Sous chef hit the bell to call for a runner, but no one came. It didn't seem like it was a big priority that no one was running the dish that they had just taken the time to create. There's nothing more frustrating to see your food prepared and ready to be served, but no one is around to bring it to you. And it wasn't that anyone was slacking, everyone was actually busy at tables.   I think the food sat there for a good 3-4 minutes before a Manager came by. The Manager ran the food to us, put the Mac and Cheese down on the other side of my friend from where I was sitting. Obviously the plate was for me but even so.. This problem can be avoided with a simple seat number system when the server takes the order.  Just some constructive criticism. I hope they rethink this side of the service and staff some runners or serving assistants and when I'm back again sometime, I hope to have an above and beyond experience."}

Almost every single dish was a salt overload and the bacon jam had a really weird texture and odd taste. They ran out of water glasses, so the guys at our table went almost a half hour without water. Burnt ends were more fatty and not very crispy, but the sauce was yummy. The fish was the best thing and was delicious.

He really had to dawdle to keep from eating his whole sandwich while me and my son waited for our burger.   Deviled eggs were good and I would order again.  Then burger came and cheese wasn't melted, not even a tiny bit. If I had known that cold cheese was going to come on it I wouldn't have ordered it. Burger was just ok. Nothing great, In-N-Out makes a more flavorful burger.  My husband liked his chicken sandwich. He just wishes he didn't have to dawdle while eating it. Since two hungry people sat staring across from him. Tater tots were good but nothing special. Mac n cheese was very good, smooth, perfect amount of bite. Portions were good.   I really don't get the mind blowing reviews. Maybe it's because we live in San Diego and this menu has been done long ago. The atmosphere is decent, nothing outstanding. Very clean. The bill coming in a book is nothing special it was a trend years ago in California. If you're hungry and in the area go ahead and eat here. But don't go out of your way to come here on a weekday.

We ordered the jalapeño poppers and the deviled eggs for appetizers. The deviled eggs were great (a little on the saltier side though) with large bits of bacon on top. The jalapeño poppers were larger than I would have liked. I had to use a fork and knife but would have rather popped small bites into my mouth. It also was not as cheesy as I was hoping for.

Although there were bits of chicken, I'm almost positive there was some ground beef on there too. Strange.  My friends ordered the NY strip steak and the baked mac and cheese. They weren't impressed by the steak but enjoyed the mac and cheese.   We had a male server who was great. Nothing to complain about the service.  I honestly won't be coming back because I wasn't impressed by the food, which was what I was really looking forward to trying. I took the pizza to go to originally bring it back to my roommate but I ended up giving it to a homeless man on Fremont St."}

Went out for lunch with my co-workers and got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese served with Spicy Tater Tots and the Green Beans for an appetizer. Keep in mind that your food does not come out at the same time, it comes as it is prepared or at least that's what they told us. In our case, our Green Beans appetizer didn't come out until we were almost done with our entrée. The Short Rib Grilled Cheese was probably one of the worst I had, the bread was burnt and over toasted and the short rib itself was dry and lacked flavor. The Tater Tots again were overdone, I mean it was more than extra crispy. Then comes the late appetizer. It was nothing appetizing, came out full of grease and extra salty. I don't know if they were having an off day but for the price and quality of the food, I will not be back."}

After we walked around the block a couple times trying to find the entrance (it's a little confusing) we were promptly seated by the window for a party of 3. We were entertaining our friend from out of town and had just come from the Mob Museum (highly recommended). The place was packed, so we were delighted to be seated quickly.   Our server was very friendly and helpful. He suggested a few dishes and was spot on. The plates are small portions, like tapas. They are shareable. We ordered green beans and a wonderful, tender steak. It was amazing! The guys each had a domestic beer, but I ordered a cider based on the server's recommendation. I forget the name (I'll add the name later when I find it). It was an imported cider from Swizterland. Wonderful and refreshing! The atmosphere is a modern, trendy pub with unique artwork. Very hipster.   We loved Carson Kitchen, but unfortunately they lost tons of points with me after I saw dogs laying around in the dining room. Yes, DOGS! LIVE DOGS!!! This disgusted me and I couldn't help, but think there was dog hair in my food.    I've since have discussed this with the owner who tells me he only allows service dogs in. Although, there isn't a lot of regulations on how to determined whether a dog is a service dog or not. He has assured me he has trained his staff and looked into the legal requirements. It turns out the owners of the dogs do not have to provide any proof. Just about anyone can walk in with a dog and say it's a service dog. It most likely was service dogs we saw that night.   I can understand business owners delimma. If they question whether a dog is a service dog they run the risk of offending the owner. If they refuse to let them in the risk a lawsuit. When they do let them in other customers, such as myself, are turned off. I've also learned most service dogs are used for depression and anxiety, not physical disabilities. There seems to be a lot more service dogs around. I'm seeing dogs in hair and nail salons, restaurants, and I even saw one in a Target that had a grocery section!   If I do return to Carson Kitchen and there happens to be dogs in the dining room I will choose to go elsewhere."}

We've also just hung out at the bar on numerous occasions people watching, which can be quite interesting.  I love the quirky decor and the outside area in the back. The drink list is good, love the mason jars and the fun cocktail names. Where Park misses the mark for me has been a consistent disappoint in food and service. It lacks the wow factor and the staff often at times seems less than excited to wait on you. Guess what people! We're not all tourists and some of us are looking for favorite places to hang out. Ignoring your customer or acting like it's an imposition that we would want - gasp FOOD for lunch - is not going to turn Park into our Cheers.

What happened on Friday evening was out of everything I have ever seen and heard. I understand that NYE/NY is stressful time being at work (or in general working in a place like Las Vegas) but wow.  We arrived with our group of friends (who had just gotten married that day by the way). We wanted to sit outside and out waitress told us that it is no problem and we get the heaters for you, I'll come back when you have all settled. There was a guy who was dealing with the heaters and one of the guys in our group asked How long is it going to take, we are freezing? Just wondering if you need any help...? The guy didn't say anything so we just assumed he was okay.  Service was good, food was good and we tipped above average.  When it was time to leave, two people from our group decided to have two shots (hello, they got married that day! Why not? :) )   This was when the fun begun.  The bartender told them I don't serve you anymore. Get out of here. Our friends were like Excuse me? Why?  The next thing he did was that he asked the security guy to walk them out. Our friends asked again Why? since no one had said anything or done anything that would have been consider hurtful or out of order.   The security guy had a HUGE ATTITUDE problem and after few rants he PHYSICALLY grab  one of the girls (waist) and tried to push her out. When her boyfriend was trying to tell him that he is not allowed to touch anyone (especially since she didn't even said anything, just stood there not understanding what's going on) the security guy said; I CAN DO WHAT EVER I WANT TO IN MY BAR.  When another person from our group went to the guy asking what is going on he said to her that oh bitch, you are with them too? Get the fuck outta here! You are not welcome.  Okay dude calm down.   I feel bad for Park on Fremont that I have to write on Yelp a review since when I tried to complain thru phone the management (or how do I know if it was management after all, I wouldn't be surprise that it was the same guy who was working on the bar that night ha!) wasn't heard at all.

Are we being kicked out? And he said yes. I asked him why and he looked a little embarassed and immediately said Would you like to talk to my manager? And I said yes. So a woman came up to me saying someone complained about us. I asked what the complaint was and she said someone was offended by us. I asked what we said or did that was offensive and she could not tell me. In the mean time there was a group of college kids with LSU t-shirts next to us cheersing shots and being very loud, and yet MY small group of 3 people who ate dinner and had 2 drinks was being asked to leave for being offensive! I couldn't believe it. And especially with no explanation. I will NEVER go back there and I tell all friends and family to stay away.

The chicken and waffle sandwich is neat in concept and plays well with the finger food mentality of the place. The drawback comes in the fact that the waffle was almost soggy and lukewarm. The chicken is nothing impressive. The choice of sides are decent. We went with the potato salad and it was good. They use egg in the mixture and that was very good. As the night progressed I ordered the veggie pita wrap with a side of sweet potato tots. This was better. The warm pita stuffed full with cheese and a variety of grilled vegetables was much better. The fact that they were removing items from their menu left us with little to choose from kind of hindered the dining experience.  The garden seating is amazing due to its Alice in Wonderland-esque decor. I would love to go back and take everything in. Hopefully the menu will be hashed out by then."}

There were 4 of us including one teenager. After we sat on the outside patio, a young waitress came to us and seemed appalled. Did the hostess seat you?  No, we seated ourself per the sign. She continued that they don't allow children after 6 pm (20 minutes from our entry time) even though we never saw any posting of the sort or could even figure out why they wouldn't let kids in to eat there, even after 6. We ordered after we convinced the waitress that we would be quick because of a later commitment. Dinner was, fine, nothing special. Fresh but didn't blow me away. At about 6:15 as the waitress brought the check, she tells me, I spoke to the manager, and it's ok.  OK? Ok for what? We were done. Was she angling for a bigger tip because she allowed us to skirt this ridiculous, non posted, possibly made up policy? There are a lot of cool little places popping up downtown. Based on other reviews I've read here on Yelp for Park On Fremont, I think that some customer service techniques should be shared with the staff, if anyone there has the skills or cares to share them.

Tonight we found ourselves out and about downtown for our friends birthday, and inevitably end up here to do this Scorpion Shot.

The whole time Aerrick was super awesome, he was friendly and didn't seem annoyed by our obnoxious birthday boy. He frequently fist bumped and was most definitely attentive.   Our waters came first, as expected. Beers and margaritas to follow - and just after the food order we had our shots delivered. 5 shots down & A few entrees later we receive our bill.   All of the Mezcal shots were $20 and rang in as scorpion something. And then there was mine. Don Julio 70 FOR $29.  $29? Are you kidding? I drink 1942 at Goldspike for $25. Let me tell you that it isn't the price point that has me bothered, it's the fact that our server failed to mention the bump or that Don Julio 70 was all he had. I would've swapped it for Mezcal.   I work in the industry and this is completely unacceptable. Lesson learned for this place - ASK PRICE POINTS AND CHECK RECEIPTS.

Our server was Debbie, I joined my party late and had to wait five minutes before leaving my table and going to the counter to get a menu. And then I waited another three minutes at the counter while two employees looked at me and kept moving. I stopped someone and asked if I place my order there or if my server does it for me, and as if my question inconvenienced him, he said my server would do it. Then Debbie comes to the table and without saying hi, welcome to Nacho Daddy or hey, how's it going or even hi, she says what can I get for you? She REALLY made me wanna pay 15 dollars for two tacos. She brought me water but didn't bring me a place setting. It'd be one thing if it was busy, but she had two other tables. And then when we asked someone else for the check, because 4 out of the 6 people had been done with their food for a while, the guy said, in a hurried tone, she's gonna get it, she's doing something right now. Even if Debbie was legitimately busy, there still wouldn't be an excuse for the wait time of things & her attitude on top of that added to the not-so-great experience.  I don't know how my group was acting before I showed up, but even if they were some what of a hassle because they took too long to order, or couldn't decide or were constantly talking over each other, you're still in the service industry and your job is to put up with it and you deal with it every day, so buck up and deal with it.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Evidently I can't even leave the stars above blank before writing a heinous review, so 1 star it reluctantly is for this discriminating hipster shack.   We came here after the Color Run today, a huge annual event that brings a bunch of people downtown. Events like this means money makers for all the bars and restaurants downtown. When one would think a business owner would be prepared for a busy day with the rush of a fun loving, perhaps hungry and thirsty crowd. It would be a potential win win for the patrons and the owners. But apparently, our money was no good at Park on Fremont as my crowd was straight turned away. Yes, turned away. Apparently, this place just couldn't accommodate a party of 9, which included 3 kids.   To back up, our crew was perhaps the third party in line before the place was to open for business. A couple of employees were clearly setting everything up outside to get ready. I asked one of the employees if kids were even allowed because I'm not some asshole parent who assumes every place should be kid-friendly, especially a place like this where it's generally meant for the younger, hip Zappos working brunch bunch. She told me yes, as long as we sat outside on the patio. This was fine with us, so we continued to wait in line. A couple of people who also participated in the event, were ahead of us in line. After about 5 minutes of standing in line, waiting, the same employee, who appeared to be the hostess asked out loud, Are you all in line to get in? The fuck? Was that a serious question? My brother, ever a smartass, replied with a Oh, this isn't the line for Aerosmith tickets? which amused all of us. So to answer her question, uh, yeah, we're waiting here patiently to get in as soon as you open for business, if that's okay. Then she made some huffy comment about how the participants from the event would have to sit outside because of the paint that covered their clothes. Hmm, okay? It's not actual paint, it's powder that doesn't stick to anything, but that's fine. I was already anticipating that our party would have to sit outside anyway because of the kids. She seated the people ahead of us, outside on the patio of course because of their Color Run crud painted attire. Then she came back to us and I asked for a table of 9. She seemed hesitant, put out even, and replied, Uh, I'm going to have to ask my manager if that can be done! Seriously?! I offered that we can be split up if need be, 6 at one table, 3 at another nearby. She walked away and a few seconds later she came back allegedly with her manager's answer: Yeah, we can't do that right now, we don't have the space. You don't have the space? YOU JUST OPENED UP FOR BUSINESS! How do you not have the space to accommodate us?   We had been standing there for a collective total of at least 10 minutes, I had asked ahead of getting up to the line if kids were allowed and if it wasn't the Color Run mess, it was the fact that there were just too many of us now. Yeah, okay sister! I'm sure if my party had been more Park on Fremont friendly sporting long beards, skinny jeans and it was someone's 21st birthday, a party of 9 would have easily been accommodated. Oh and for the record, there were 6 adults in my party, 4 of us for sure would've ordered some form of an alcoholic beverage, stacking money up on that bill for sure. But, okay whatever. You don't have the space. More like you don't want to serve us because we have people in our group who won't be drinking. Message received.  I have never actually been straight turned away from a business for any reason so this is a first for me. What kind of bullshit is this where a restaurant actually turns you away because your party is allegedly too big and seating can't accommodated, when they had just opened for business and there's clearly plenty of seating? And when you try to accommodate the business by offering to be split up, they're still not having it? Yeah, this was never about space. It probably wasn't even about the dreadful powered paint possibly rubbing off on their precious bar furniture. This was about the fact my party consisted of 3 kids which goes against Park on Fremont's credo of hip, cool young people who can order booze. The hostess and her snotty attitude would have been better suited to tell me that no, kids were not allowed. I would've been fine with that and we would have moved on, no hard feelings.

There was a good crowd but it was not too crazy. The service was not the greatest. It was incredibly difficult to find our waitress and order food. Once we finally did, it took 35 minutes to receive our food! We ordered the queso dip (which we asked to be brought before everything considering it is an appetizer), but it came with everything at the same time. Also, the three tables that were seated at least 15 minutes after us received their food far earlier than we did, which did not make sense. The queso was good, but only when it was hot. After that it had some sort of funky after taste. The kale salad was incredibly bland and disappointing. The fiesta nachos were okay but not anything close to what I expected them to be. Overall, we left nacho daddy with queasy stomachs and had to end our night there. Definitely not how you want to spend Vegas."}

I happened to look over at the bar and saw the bar tender standing there. Then I saw our drinks sitting there. Our waiter passed our drinks at least 4 times that I saw and never brought them to our table. We also ordered 3 street tacos as an appetizer, I;m not sure how long those were sitting there, but it was a huge let down. Obviously, we left and felt bad about not paying for our water glasses. As we were walking out, the waiter had the nerve to say, thanks for coming in. Thank's for not serving us. Upon complaining we were offered to come back, but we are on vacation and have everything planned out. You lost that chance when you treated us like dirt. It sucks that we have planned on eating at this place for months and we were treated so bad. Save your money and go somewhere that wants you there."}

Or so I thought. Not sure if everyone is drunk when they review this place or what but the food was horrible.  No one in my office was satisfied with their food.  I ordered the Supreme Tostada Nacho and it ended up missing half of the things that are listed as being on it (fried jalapenos, avocado lime salsita, cilantro, etc).  It was some bland beef, bland fake cheese and a little real cheese on top of greasy chips.  Not sure how they can pride themselves on their nachos when I could get better ones from Taco Bell.   Another co-worker got steak street tacos - she said they were bland and nothing to write home about.  The wings were also not very tasty.   So much for a new lunch spot downtown for us...."}

They were really friendly but it took a long time for us to get our food. 45 minutes to an hour which is quite long.   I got chicken enchiladas which I typically get at the Henderson location but they were not good. The tortilla was too thick, the chicken wasn't even shredded, more of chunks and the flavor tasted like it came from a can. The rice was hard and nothing to be desired.   Chips were good but you can't really mess that up. Waiting for our check took a while too. Clearly we were ready to go and our waiter walked passed us multiple times without a check in his hand. Finally after bringing it by it took another 10 minutes for him to come get it and the card to pay, despite 1/3 of our party standing up.  Many groups came, ate and left while we were still waiting for our food. We had 3 people in our group so our order was not large.

She was in the mood for nachos, so coming here was a no-brainer.   Upon entering, we were thrown off by having to seat ourselves. It was kind of packed, so finding a table in the back took a minute. There was a large party in the center that seemed to be taking up everyone's attention, so it was about 5 minutes before we even got menus and another 5 before we got to speak with our server.  Fortunately, that gave us time to decide what we wanted to order, so we ordered as soon as he arrived.   It took nearly 45 minutes to get our food, but again, that was due to the large party in the center. The food was fresh when it arrived, but was mediocre at best.   Her nachos were over-saturated with this extremely spicy salsa. The amount of cheese on the nachos gave the impression that ANY cheese on there was merely an accident. It was primarily a plate of chips and salsa, garnished with chicken and a few vegetables.    I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was amazing. The fries were great while they were piping hot. However, as soon as they cooled down, they became hard as a rock and hazardous to my health. I couldn't finish even half of them (and there weren't a lot to begin with).   The part that gives this experience 3 stars (and not 1 or 2, as the food was quite a disappointment) was the service. Our server was Danny, and the little amount of service the party in the center allowed him to give us was excellent.   Overall, it was a decent experience. Not one I intend to repeat any time soon, though."}

Stop with the cry baby nonsense and stop creating lies to justify the bad treatment I received. I'm wondering if Park at Fremont is part of the militant gay community and is all about shaming rather than open conversation.

No free chips and salsa, have to pay for those. The crispy taco shell was not homemade, a little stale. We were charged an extra $1 for a small dish of salsa because the meal came with about 2 tablespoons of salsa. The chicken enchilada nachos were so-so, could have been better.

Needless to say I went back last night because of just those same reasons, needed a place to drink, that wasn't full of loud music... So I gave it another try, and I'm glad I did.

Also, if you venture a little further outside to the back of the seating area, there's a doorway off the side that leads to a small area with a seesaw. The inside is nice too, but it's definitely a hipster vibe with crazy wallpaper prints and animal heads on the walls.   The drink prices are pretty comparable to other places downtown, so expect to spend about $7/beer or $8/cocktail. They do have a beer and a shot deal which recently went up from $10 to $12, but still it's a pretty decent deal. They do have some good beers offered for this deal like Dog Fish Head 90 IPA, and it's not just well alcohol.

Nacho Daddy regularly features musical performers and artists which really helps reflect what DTLV has been focusing on for the past years.  The food is similar to the Henderson location, but seemingly in smaller portions. The street tacos are delicious and the Thai chicken nachos are a great twist and a must-try dish. Splurge on the deep-fried ice cream, its worth it!  The bar gets extra points for serving up margaritas in mason jars! Though the food is pretty good I thought it was overpriced; $14 for nachos? $10 for margaritas? Meh.

We pushed them to the end and waited for service.

We would have gladly stayed, ordered food and probably 5 or 6 more rounds but we opted to not spend our time where we would get crappy service.

Ambiance is amazing and quaint and I really want this place to do well so that is why I'm writing this review.   The second time I went there I went around 12:30pm and asked to sit on the back patio. That was a mistake because the sun was blazing hot and there were no umbrellas, fans, or misters. It's not even summer yet and the outside will miserably fail if something isn't done to change that. So everyone was moving tables and switching spots to avoid the sun.   Which brings me to another problem that Park probably won't be able to fix as easily ... The patio side is up against an alley, where all the trash from surrounding bars is dumped. In the sun, the smell was so horrible I felt like I was going to throw up, I don't know how they're going to fix that issue. But you can't expect to serve food to people when they're smelling rotting trash. Revolting.   Then, we ordered the Mac n cheese Philly and the bar chicken bites... But it took 55 minutes for the food to come out at 45 minutes for anyone to realize there was an issue with our order. A manager never stopped by to apologize and at the end of the meal they removed one item from our bill.   I've worked in the hospitality industry for over ten years. I know it's not all the waitresses fault, however managers need to be more aware of what's going on in their restaurant. (I saw them dealing with contractors so I'm assuming they were preoccupied) ..regardless, get ON your kitchen and get the food out!

With the menu having been studied for at least that long, we were ready to order. The waiter breezed up, took my drink order for ONE BEER and left without getting the food order. The waiter breezed up with the beer, took the food order of filet mignon nachos and an order of shrimp ceviche. The sad nachos arrived to the table with very little cheese, drowned is a terrible sauce, low presence of steak, and sad looking guacamole. The chips were fresh. The ceviche was a no. All around...a no. No flavor, nothing, period! The avocado was fresh. Oh yeah, I wanted another beer, no one ever came back to the table. Once done with dinner, we waited, and waited, and waited for the bill. Finally it shows up and guess how much 1 beer, 1 plate of nachos, and 1 ceviche appetizer cost...OVER FIFTY DOLLARS!

Complaining that there were too many of us and we were too loud. I was unaware that we were supposed to be whispering at this bar. There was also an instance when we were trying to take a group picture in front of the bar's sign which we were to later post (advertisement) and a female bartender made a snappy comment that she needed to get through our picture so that she could work to a couple of our group members while we were in the midst of taking the picture.

We arrived around the lunchtime hour (1PM-ish) and assumed they would be busy and we would have to rush to eat. Nope! To our surprise it wasn't busy at all (Thank GOD) because we were on a bit of a time crunch. Seated promptly our server came over to take our drink orders and because we had a whole 8 hours to go nobody opted for any adult beverages.. Yes we are responsible individuals lol. Anyways the water comes out in this cool glass jug and the cups in these little glass jars (cute).  Browsing the menu for lunch I guess I was a bit indecisive because they didn't really have anything that stuck out for me to try for lunch. I ended up with a Greek Salad (I know boring). My co-workers ordered the Turkey Bacon Avo-Philly and Marinated Chicken Tacos. Everyone's general response for the food was meh just okay.

My friends ordered the fried egg burger, and typically the egg is over easy when it comes to these burgers. But in their case the egg was fully cooked, I'm not sure if that's something you have to clarify or not.

Craving this rare sloppy heap of goodness, I ventured over. The interior is spacious and clean, with a cool array of art and collectibles to look at.  The outdoor seating area is far more popular, but I prefer indoors.  Based on this one visit, that's the best thing I can say about POF, aside from the friendly, efficient service.  The Monte Cristo was a hearty sandwich with generous ham and cheese between 2 grilled bread slices.  But it had absolutely NO flavor-  it wasn't cheesy, hammy, nor french toasty.  It only tasted like the grill it was cooked on.  If they had remembered to put powdered sugar on it the way the menu described, it might have been a bit tastier.  But it just went down without registering anything savory, sweet or otherwise.    It's hard to find a Monte Cristo, so kudos to them for providing one.  It does silence the hunger for sure, but tastewise it was lacking.  So for now, it's Cheesecake Factory on Sundays for a decent Monte Cristo.  If I return to POF, I will simply try something else."}

Since the servers were neglecting the back area, I got up to return the cold potatoes. When I saw my server, she couldn't be bothered to apologize. She later said they were short staffed.

We've been to PoF many times and I've hosted quite a few lady brunches there.  On 8/8/15 we met up with some friends who are from out of town. We suggested that we all go to PoF to avoid a lot of the drama and crazies you encounter downtown. We arrive and a heavy set African man asked to see our id's in such a manner that it already set a bad tone for our friends new experience there.  We then go sit in the back yard and wait for 17 minutes. Nobody came by. We tried to ask a female server with her head shaved on the sides of she could serve us or send someone else and she responded with your not in my section. She acted like we insulted her by U.S. Asking for service. I ask my husband to go inside with his friend  to the bar and get us drinks. My girlfriend and I are waiting for another 15 minutes. We go inside to find the bouncers harassing our husbands claiming that they broke a light fixture in the men's bathroom. They took there id's and called the police. We go outside to wait for metro and as we are waiting the bouncers and the hostesses are antagonizing us. Acting like children. The heavier set African American man even went as far as sticking his tongue out at us. Yes.. You read that correct.. A grown man acting literally like a toddler. After metro showed up they couldn't pin the broken light fixture on my husband. They had him in handcuffs and everything. I asked for all the employees names that were outside taunting us and they refused. I have never in all my years living in Vegas have dealt with such unprofessional staff. I will do my best to let all of our friends in the art community, entertainment community and out of towners to avoid this business. I highly recommend the owners train the staff to act like civilized humans instead of animals. If any of my employees behaved in such a manner I would fire them on the spot. Also I will be conducting an investigation to get all of these staff members names and will update my yelp review with this information. Please avoid this place."}

The hostess convinced us to eat at the outdoor patio right next to a space heater since indoor seating was full. Too bad the space heater died out about 10 minutes after we sat down. Woman! Don't promise me heat, only to leave me in the bitter cold moments after I get comfortable at my table! The table next to us requested the heater be turned back on all but 3 times. The runner was in charge of this duty, but was struggling to keep up with Taco Tuesday night. He eventually got to the heater, but we were finishing up our meals by the time we were warm and toasty again.   $2 STREET TACOS: My husband said the tacos were perfect. The tacos were topped with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. I asked if they could make vegetarian tacos, but no such luck. :(    GARBAGE FRIES ($5 during Happy Hour): The fries were good until they weren't. Have you ever ate something that started out good, but then blew out by the end of the meal? That's what happened to me.   $1 DOS EQUIS: These bottles are cute. They're practically made for infants. I laughed out loud when I poured a bottle into the plastic cup the restaurant provided - it barely filled a quarter of the cup! I say, False Advertisement! They should have Tiny written in next to their $1 Dos Equis menu.   SERVICE: The waitress and the runner were doing their best to keep up. My husband got his street tacos before we received our beers. There seemed to be a lot of confusion on which tables ordered what. Maybe it's because we were sitting outside?   ATMOSPHERE: There was a combination of younger and older people here. Our table on the patio was tucked away behind some greenery, so we were afforded some privacy. The music was decent, until it cut off into awkward silence. Turn the music back on peeps!   Return Visit? Yes, but not on Taco Tuesday. Their selection for vegetarians is quite small, but I'd like to try their Veggie burger ($10) next time. If the veggie burger fails me, then nope, not coming back.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #13"}

It was Halloween night and me and my coworkers wanted to have a nice night out so we chose to have a quick late meal here paired with drinks. Later they wanted to go home so we said our goodbyes at the front then needed to use the restroom so proceeded to the front doors. I noticed the security guard arguing with my friend who politely mentioned she needed to use the restroom and was a paying customer and he loudly made a scene about how they were closed and mocked her.   All while the manager was standing near, not doing anything. I understand it was getting late and close to closing time but it was around 2:30am mind you, they close at 3am plus there were about 20 something people inside the establishment. Soon after we ended up using restroom and I noticed people at the back courtyard area so I didn't see a big deal to step foot and show my friend the seesaw room really quick. We found a nice guy who was with his group of friends and asked him to take a photo. But was immediately interrupted by the woman manager who seemed to follow us and said we cannot take the photo and demanded us to leave. How spiteful of her to choose to pick on us in front of other guests. The guy holding my camera was flabbergasted at the manager and said that was really rude, and took the photos of us anyway. I just wanted to show my friend a room she's never seen before and figured it would change her upset mood over the security guard incident. And didn't see the big deal of taking a quick look before we headed out, in addition there were still a lot people! The manager threatened to call metro, we were so polite I didn't feel that was necessary. Not even 3am yet. Both the security guard and manager felt the need to argue with us and make a seen in front of other paying customers. Had they known we are in the hospitality business too, I've also written content about Las Vegas venues and Things to Do around Vegas, and my friend was looking into Park for her wedding reception, would they have treated us better?

My friends and I decided to share the Supreme Tostada Nachos that pretty much had everything and we also shared the Mexican corn. As for drinks, I had their house margarita while my friends got a white peach margarita and blood orange margarita.   The nachos were very delicious. The flavor of everything blended together very well. The corn was okay. I've had better elsewhere. As for the drinks, to be completely honest, they all tasted pretty much the same to me. They all tasted like sweet and sour mixed with tequila. I couldn't really distinctly tasted the difference much. There were fruity flavors to them but the flavor was really light.   The only thing is that Nacho Daddy is a little bit on the pricey side. $17.50 for a plate of nachos with everything? Yowza. The margaritas run about $11-12 per. Granted, you're on Fremont street where it's mostly tourist so it's pretty much standard.   End point: pretty good food. Mediocre drinks."}

She brought 2 waters out for my hubs and I (we got there first)  and forgot to put ice in ONE of them She checked on us once during the meal,  and we had to flag someone down for the check.

The wombat tasted like grapefruit juice and actually had a peice of glass in the drink. The manager did come over and bought another drink to correct the mistake. After drinks we started with the mac balls. Then we ordered dinner the chicken and waffle sandwich(the chicken was horribly dry), steak salad (I literally had 3 thin slices of steak on my salad) the chicken balls (again dry) and the ribs ( again over cooked). So our food comes out and Baily has forgotten the mac balls. 10 mins later with dinner almost done we get the mac balls. BEST PART OF THE WHOLE EXPERINCE! They were so good. When every one finishes we ask for the check to be split in half with 2 credit cards. Some how this gets screwed up and ends up taking us 10mins just to pay for our dinner.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "As an update to my 1 star review, Paul S. privately messaged me in response the same day, which I post the screenshot for your reading pleasure. I have to say, if this is an apology, it's the most spiteful one I've ever received. And if your job title for this establishment is Customer Service you may want to revisit the definition since you were generous enough to provide me the definition of RESERVATIONS in your response, which I will happily address hereto.   Let's start with your alleged video and audio feed from the front patio. Your camera equipment must be some high tech stuff for sure. Does it project scenarios from your hostess's mind wherein she thought to say the word reservations out loud in order to deter me and my party from being seated? Or perhaps you were viewing a completely different video from a different day where a woman with the same number of people in her party, including 3 minors, had an impatient attitude after being told she would have to wait 15 minutes due to patrons with patio reservations? Either way, your review of the alleged video and audio of what happened is pure fiction.  No, I was not told it would be a 15 minute wait and that our party could be accommodated after customers with patio reservations were seated. No, your hostess never once uttered the word reservations at any point during our exchange. No, your hostess didn't ask anyone standing in that line waiting to get seated if they had reservations. No, I did not react as you suggested, and I quote: ...an attitude and impatience on your part because you were not immediately accommodated. No, that did not happen, not even a little. I'm sure that sort of scenario has happened in the past and I'm sure it's going to happen in the future. But that did not happen on that day with me and my party of 9, who were patiently waiting for the restaurant to open and to be seated. I have 8 witnesses who can back me up on that versus your so-called front patio video and audio feed.   Your hostess, by proxy of your manager, who I never spoke to, simply came back to me and stated: We cannot seat you. Period. End of story. No further words, explanations, consolations, suggestions and/or insinuations using the word that you so aptly and condescendingly defined for me: RESERVATIONS. I don't blame this hostess for her dismissive attitude because apparently it's written in her job description and practiced as a matter of the culture within, rolling down from the top. I maintain that this place has a demographic it would prefer to cater to and that's fine. I missed the red velvet rope while standing in line waiting for the business to open so that we could be seated.        I'm a native of this town and I've seen a lot of restaurants like this one come and go. I've worked in the restaurant business, I understand the concept of customer service and a place is only as good as its management's treatment of all of its customers, would-be and regulars. I wasn't asking for anything outrageous or being difficult to your staff. I asked for a couple of tables for us to sit and eat. Had you bothered to actually read my review, I am the one who suggested that my party of 9 could be split up, ultimately being a customer accommodating both a hostess and a manager who could not be bothered so early in the day. Your sardonic tone complete with false accusations of a non-existent scenario in response to my review, messaged to me rather than posted, shows an utter lack of concern or professionalism on your part. You would have done well enough to just not respond to me at all, Paul S."}

Thanks to checking in shortly after placing our drink order, I know I'm not exaggerating.  When our waitress brought our drinks, she brought my friend the wrong drink.  We sat another ten minutes and without her coke.  We saw the waitress walk by with an empty tray and didn't acknowledge us or come back to take our food orders.

We had a large group at a picnic table on the patio in the back, it has a charming feel to it. Water and drinks are served in mason jars, another detail which was cute.   Since it is summer in Vegas, I was looking for a light option: the Strawberry Salad another Yelper was enjoying looked great. First I asked if any protein could be substituted for chicken, as I'm a Pescetarian: answer was no. The salad was indeed refreshing with berries, walnuts, gorgonzola and mixed greens. When the bill arrived, I was shocked that I was charged $12.00; the same price as the salad with chicken. A tall Belvedere and soda was also $12.00. Didn't want to nitpick at a party, so I paid my $31 (with Auotgrat, tax etc) and we explored the teeter totter/smoking area of patio and took photos.   Service was professional and a little over zealous on bussing. Different people kept asking to clear plates and at one point, took someone's unfinished meal. Water glasses were regularly filled and we were asked if we needed more drinks, etc. Those having the chicken and waffle sandwich were underwhelmed: the waffle was not crispy on the outside and one said something seemed to be missing. Both the sweet potato tot and fried pickle I tasted were good; the sriracha ketchup was great - and I don't care for ketchup! In all, the meals were good, but not great.   The patio is really pretty and has some quirky and interesting decor: mismatched plates adorn one wall and a large portrait of horses ummm mating, another. Eclectic. It looks very pretty lit up at night.   I'd definitely come back for drinks, the bar looked cool and drink prices were reasonable. The menu could use some tweaking especially in the non-fried food, vegetarian options. A welcome addition to Fremont Street.   Yelp 100 Challenge"}

Multiple small and large parties. Great I thought! It's going to be AMAZING! 40 minutes goes by and I'm pretty annoyed because ALL those people were sat before us. But whatever we were quoted 50 minutes. Then 50 minutes goes by.. an hour.. so we check in again with the hostess. She informed us that she was waiting for a larger table to seat us since we needed a high chair. Okay fine. We finally get seated an hour and a half after we checked in and we were seated at two tables pushed together. One table so wobbly they had to overlap it with the other table to sort of stabilize it but it would slowly inch apart and be wobbly again. The hostess said the manager would be over to fix it. He or she never showed. I was literally seated between the two tables and couldn't even keep my plate level.  We waited a good while before a waiter and a trainee come to ask about what we'd like to drink. We order drinks and appetizers and then wait even longer to order food than we did to order drinks.  Our queso came out wrong (we asked for the toppings on the side) so it had to be remade.

Food was good but considering how tiny the sections are and that we had zero service from our waitress and that the runners behavior was terrible. Also we asked for a manager, they said she was too busy to talk to us, the hostess even said that. This place is an embarrassment, I could serve circles around the idiots there."}

Dining options were rather slim when we were strolling between the Fremont Street Experience and the Mob Museum. We noticed too late that Tony Gemignani opened one of his pizzerias, Pizza Rock, smack in the middle of the area, and we were already in shock over the sight of the Heart Attack Grill where they let people weighing at least 350 lbs eat for free. We were grateful we didn't meet that threshold.  By comparison, Nacho Daddy seemed like a downright demure dining destination in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. It's really just as much a bar as it is a place to eat although the menu is pretty robust with not only nachos but also breakfasts, burgers, wraps and other Mexican dishes. Jamie W. was hungrier than I was and ordered the $13.50 Vegan Burrito, which was a flour tortilla stuffed mostly with wild rice with bits of Cajun-spiced tofu, black beans, vegan cheese, diced peppers and onions, mushrooms, fire-roasted corn, avocado salsita and pico de gallo (photo: http://bit.ly/1ZiHHn2).  It was quite a pile in there, but it wasn't overly flavorful for all the ingredients. I just went with the $9.95 Flour Quesadilla which was just a flour tortilla with mozzarella cheese melted inside accompanied by a mini-scoop of sour cream and pico de gallo (photo: http://bit.ly/1RZtC8F). It was alright though something I could have made on a dorm hot plate a hundred years ago. We noticed the place start to fill up with regulars mostly around the bar, but I have to give props to the manager whom I think was the one serving us since the younger server was keeping busy entertaining the bar patrons.   FOOD - 3 stars...middling Mexican food maybe more satisfying after a stint at the bar AMBIANCE - 3 stars...nothing special, kinda Tex-Mex in feel SERVICE - 4 stars...for the unexpectedly efficient server TOTAL - - 3 stars...now who's your nacho daddy now?"}

First, the romaine in my salad was brown on the ends so it obviously wasn't fresh. Second, my soup and bread bowl came out colder than room temperature and I had to send it back, which I hate doing being a server myself. Third, we told our server, skinny girl with long black hair and purple on top that our parking meter was about to run out so we needed our check. She walked past us again a few minutes later with no check, said nothing, and then another couple of minutes later we see her seating a party of twenty and taking all of their drink orders! Get out of here!! I had to leave the table and go pull the car out while my boyfriend waited for our check another 10 minutes. UNREAL! We still left almost 20%, but I hope she realizes she missed out on the usual 30-40% we normally leave both being servers ourselves. Lastly, a little too pricy for what you get. Don't think we'll be back."}

I had the 'San Diego burger' (I think that's what it was, but I can't seem to find their menu anywhere. it had avocado on it) with some sweet potato tots.  I also shared the fried pickles with my lovely dining partner, since I am a discerning fried pickle eater.    Beer selection was great, decor/atmosphere was great - make sure to check out the patio out back.  I wasn't in love with my burger, though.. I didn't find it particularly flavorful - the meat especially didn't stand out to me.  Also, I did not like the tots that much.. being sweet potato they were covered in cinnamon, which is fine and complimented the taste, but.. they were small and not that crispy or fluffy.  I would have liked a bigger sized tot, for sure - and maybe something like a drizzle of honey on them?  I don't know.. also, the sauce that they were served with did not go at all.. I kept trying it but was not into it.    As for the fried pickles.. I liked the batter they used (although I would have liked it a little thicker and/or maybe with a little cornmeal mixed in?) and they were fried properly.  I did not like the pickles on the inside.. I know they were homemade but they were barely pickled.. I expect my fried pickles to be very pickled and super classic dill-pickle style.  These were hipster fried pickles, take that as you may...  I would come back here for drinks and give a chance to some other things on the menu.. maybe I just didn't find the right thing yet - it *is* a cool spot."}

Sadly however,  our experience was anything but awesome! While the food and drinks were still good,  the horrible service left a bad taste in our mouths. It kind of came off like the servers had NO IDEA that there were people who wanted to be served. It took them 10-15 minutes to even come over to us and offer us water, then after that  another 10-15 minutes to take our order, food comes out and then I have wait 20 minutes after the food was served for the beer I ordered when they first offered us water. I have no idea what's going on, but poor service really sucks! I'm usually a good tipper, but I'm sorry I can't reward poor service. I hope they get it together, cause I really like their happy hour, garbage fries, and buffalo chicken bites."}

Upon my last visit, I had the Cuban sandwich and fried pickles. The pickles were decent. The Cuban was dry and tasteless. What makes this even sadder is that it is difficult to screw up a Cuban sandwich. It is so basic and usually delicious. The beer selection is fine, but seeing as they are serving the drafts in glass that are less than a pint, the prices are a bit steep."}

Our waiter was excellent, he gave totally great service and was fun to talk with.  We ordered margaritas, because why wouldn't we? They were just average, nothing to write home about.  We decided to split one of there nacho plates.  I am not saying they weren't good, but when your name is Nacho Daddy I expect them to fulfill the name.  Ours had very little stuff on top and something seemed not right with the cheese.  Any how, it was cheap and I believe more of a 20's crowd would absolutely love it."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Definitely a different vibe and scenery from your other typical Downtown LV Fremont Street establishment.  Which I have to say is a very good thing.  I almost felt like this could be a gastro pub plucked right out of Downtown Santa Barbara or San Diego and through the technomagic of 22nd century additive manufacturing process better known as 3D printing technology reassembled layer by layer in the spot it currently occupied on 506 E Fremont Street in Las Vegas.  The abundance of flora, interesting selection of dark wall paintings and other decorations, the open air outdoor seating area in the rear, all reminded me of portions of SoCal, even though I am sure this is an original design.  Homesick much?  Maybe.  So I made my way to yet another pub type establishment, because of yet another friend's temporary relocation away from Las Vegas party or you can shorten it to your plain old going away party, but I felt the need for verbosity.  It was still relatively early, about 6pm, and my eyes had a hard time adjusting to the dimly lit interior as you walk into the bar area off the street.  The bartender and whoever else were working there must be busy, because no one acknowledge my presence at all.  Total fail on my part, especially after I had completed a session on How To Make An entrance at a work related workshop.   Not to be deterred by having been slighted by these employees, I brazing set off to explore the depth of this unwelcoming alcoholic dispensary.  I was shortly rewarded with the sight of a pleasant outdoor seating area, seemingly from another age.  Victorian perhaps, although with an added deliberate state of rehabilitation, for that extra feeling of mysteriousness.  Just like the people of the Victorian age in London, as my many hours of period drama viewing have taught me, the behaviors of the workers in this obscured portion of the pub conformed more expectedly to the ethereal temporal throwback of that bygone age.  In other words, they acted according to their station, and greeted customers with obvious courteous deference.  A menu and a mason jar of water was promptly brought out, as I waited for the entire gathering to assemble.  [Fast forward to the exciting part of the review - the food!]  Summer Strawberry Salad - very nice and tasty.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The salad was served on an eco-friendly bamboo plate. A little more gorgonzola cheese crumbles would be nice, but not a deal breaker at $12 a serving.  Cuban Sandwich - Decent, not the greatest, but I too finished it being brought up not to waste food as a child.  But I am thinking this was a seasonal promotion, as I no longer see it on their online menu.  Or it was simply not that popular.  I also had a few bites of a friend's Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  He was on a perpetual quest to find a good version of it here somewhere in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately his quest must continue, as the version here disappointed him greatly.  The waffle was the offending element if you must know more details.    Sweet Potato Teeter Tots that came with the sandwiches were good, especially with the dipping sauces.  Way better than fries I am sure.  The Classic Burger - didn't get to try it, but that looked very good and only comes with the MSRP of $9.  Overall, a nice little get away to dine at near Fremont Street.  Now that the weather is getting nicer again, it will be back on the list of places to hit up before it gets excessively hot.  If you are bored, explore the rear rear of the property, where you get to seesaw like you did when time was simpler, the chance of upward class mobility was bright, and the Pacific is not irradiated.  3 stars!

I ordered the San Diego burger and my wife had the steak salad. We also ordered a side of the fried pickles. I have to admit that I was not impressed. The meat on the burger was way too much and you couldn't really taste anything else. The steak salad was ok but definitely nothing to rave about. The fried pickles were ok but they were soggy and cold by the time we got them. Now I understand that having good delivered can and will affect the food quality but even having said that I don't know if I would ever actually eat there again because it was just mediocre and they don't have a lot of options on the menu."}

There was a small room with about 4 parties of people eating so I was told there would be a 20 minute wait (even though there was a whole section behind the bar that was completely empty). My name was supposedly put on a list. So my family and I walked around the corner to see downtown Vegas for 15 minutes and came back. My name was never put on any list, but they said they would seat us shortly (even though now the whole place was empty). While we were waiting to be seated, I asked if they had any change for the meters outside the restaurant and was told no. Insert side eye here....you are working in a restaurant on a street with meter parking and you don't have a single quarter in this whole place for patrons. Needless to say we just walked out. RUDE. We went to another Nacho Daddy outside of the city and it was fabulous. My advice: DON'T BOTHER GOING TO THIS LOCATION."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "We came in on a Saturday night so we expected to have a long wait.  But a 30 minute wait wasn't bad.  This place is loud and cramped!  We didn't mind the noise but feeling cramped is never a good thing.   Going through the menu, there were a lot of dishes we wanted to try.  They have a large a menu so we needed extra time to order.  In the meantime, we ordered a Daddy's Margarita and a White Peach Margarita to help us decide.  Both were really good and plentiful.  I loved that it wasn't watered down and you can clearly taste the alcohol.   We finally decided on the menu. For starters we ordered the ceviche.  This was pretty good. Not too salty and ingredients tasted fresh (minus the shrimp).  What I didn't like was that the ceviche to chips ratio was way off. Too much chips, not enough ceviche.  It seemed you had to stack 3 chips together to get the ratio right.  For our main dishes we ordered the Cajun Nachos and the Baja Seafood Combo.  These portions are huge!  The Cajun Nachos could have easily been split between 2 average eaters.  This nacho dish has shrimps, andouille sausage, and cajun spices. And let me tell you, Nacho Daddy didn't skimp on the shrimps and sausage.  This dish literally overflowed with them. This dish ended up being too rich. It was hard to finish this because the spices became overwhelming.  But I think that if this was shared, it probably wouldn't have been that rich.  Another thing I didn't like was the shrimps were the frozen kind.  They did little to mask that.   The Baja Seafood Combo  definitely a better choice between the 2.  This dish consist of fish tacos and lobster/crab enchiladas with rice.  This too was rich in flavor but better balanced.  I would definitely order this again.    Our server did a good job managing the packed house.  The only complaint I have was that he forgot to put my credit card back with the receipt.  We walked out thinking that one of us grabbed it.  It took him a while to find it but eventually did."}

Walking in on a Saturday evening we figured it would be busy.   There were seats open at the bar so we snagged them up.   I wish we didn't.  The service around the bar was absolutely horrid.  First off it took them ten minutes to acknowledge our existence to take our drink order. Since we already knew what we wanted to share, we put in our order right away before she left.  That was the last we saw of our original waitress.  45 minutes later our food comes out.  It was delivered by another waiter and he asked if we needed anything else.  I politely asked for hot sauce as well as our plates and napkins.   Did we see him again?  No.  Was our waitress in sight? No.  So we are sitting there with our drinks empty for the last 25 minutes without regular place settings to eat.  My friend actually went back to the kitchen to see if we could get any assistance. He got their attention.  As we started to eat our so called Nachos, it was abundantly clear they were inedible.  The flavor was way off.  The entire bottom of the plate was water.  I would like to refer to these plate of nachos as nacho soup.  As if those weren't bad enough, the fajita sandwich tasted as if it was made the day before and sitting under heat lamps.  Was I in the twilight zone?  I just want to also mention we did not see our waitress during this entire time.    Eventually we were able to flag down another person to pay our bill.

I finally walk up to the bar and asked if I could sit anywhere? She looked shocked that the hostess wasn't out side and the then was nice enough to give us menus and found a good table for us.

Finally for my Entrée I ordered the Smothered Burrito with chicken and the green sauce it was okay. It was a little bland. The only thing that saved my Burrito was the sauce it was drenched in. The chicken on it's own was dry. Now I didn't go in thinking it was going to be authentic Mexican food but I did expect for the food to have some flavor and it didn't.

Never made it out back and no I didn't ride the see-saw either.  I'm starting to see a trend on East Fremont...subpar service and seemingly a bit of collusion amongst the other establishments.  Did you all get together and decide that the average price for a quality beer is going to be 8-10 bucks and that PBR will be 2 dollars?    The decor in the bar is pretty cool with interesting stuff to look at. They also have a decent selection of micro brews from out of state, both bottled and draft.  Service this night was a very slow start.  I sat at the bar inside for nearly 15 minutes before being greeted.  Finally someone came over and expressed surprise nobody had taken care of me yet.  Umm, you're one of the ones ignoring me too, haha!  After the slow start, service was OK...basically what I've come to expect on this block in Vegas...not great, just OK.  Are all of the bartenders on this block newbs?  Me thinks so.  Call center tech support by day, attempting bartending by evening is my guess.  Anyway...for dinner I had the Philly Mac and Cheese.  What's that you ask...well it's their version of a Philly cheesesteak with mac and cheese plopped on top. I was skeptical to say the least but figured what the heck I'll give it a shot.  So, I'm from Philly...doesn't compare at all but the added mac and cheese on top made it unique enough that I would recommend trying it and may even order that again myself.

But this place was horrible service was super slow to start over 1 hour to get our food with hardly any people there. The food came out cold and at different times my wife ordered hamburger and tater tots when they came out it had a used chewed-up chicken wing on top of her tater tots the waiter acted like it was not a big deal LOL someone chewed on a chicken wing and it was on her plate and it wasn't a big deal LOL my burger was burnt I asked for a side salad with ranch you would figure that's what you would get but no you got the ranch but it also balsamic vinaigrette mixed in the salad horrible place to dine for locals may be okay for tourist who will never see this place again."}

Every item is either greasy, painfully dry, or a mixture of awkward flavors.  About the only things I would even consider to recommend is the tater tots or fried pickles, but those items don't really showcase a menu, rather late night drunk food.    It's a typical downtown hipster setting, and the decor is suiting to that theme.  They change up the art work on occasion and I do find the paintings and photos interesting and fun to look at.   The service and staff are very friendly and attentive.  But overall, I wouldn't say this is a place I would recommend, rather if I am invited to go with people, I wouldn't object."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "After giving a 5 star review to the location on The Strip, it pains me to have to do this. After thinking it over, it's really a safety issue. So I am giving 1 star for this reason alone. And it's definitely a solid reason.  Why in the heck do you have a Gluten Free/Vegan menu if your items listed are not truly gluten free and/or vegan??????? And that's me asking nicely. Because I'm actually super ticked. My 4 year old has food allergies. He carries an epi pen around with him. We took him here SPECIFICALLY because the vegan portion of the menu had vegan/gluten free cheese on their nachos. I am glad I double checked with the waitress, Alex (who was really the shining star in all of this), who double checked with the kitchen. The kitchen said they mix their vegan/gluten free cheese with regular flour- making it NOT gluten free.  If I had trusted Nacho Daddy to be true to their menu description, my poor 4 year old would have had an allergic reaction that would have lasted for days. DAYS... D-A-Y-S, Nacho Daddy. I know it's a joke and irritating to some people in the restaurant industry to have to cater to food intolerances and allergies, but that gives you no right to be negligent and misleading with your menu to entice an entire group of people to patron your establishment- some of them have zero choice in the matter, my son included.  Aside from that, I ordered a Daddy's Marg on the rocks with no salt- it came with salt and was really lacking in the tequila. I don't drink heavily- rarely socially, as does my girl friend that went with us and had a sip, and we both agreed it was weak. I may as well have ordered a $10 limeade.   Her Cheeseburger Nachos were decent, the guac was good, and the ceviche was ok, pretty small for $10.  Side note: When I checked in here, a yelp notification came up saying that there are multiple reviews from the same IP to boost their rating for this specific location.. Kinda shady.   Update: Since writing this review, Taylor reached out to me and provided an explanation. Instead of sending a manager or someone from the kitchen staff, they said they mix their cheese with flour so we wouldn't order it at all. There is a chance of cross contamination, which I get. It's usually like that at a lot of places. I really wish someone would have just talked to me for 2 minutes instead of lying about it and causing distrust. There is a venue down the street, Chef Stacy Dugan's spot, that has Vegan/GF nachos and can instantly and accurately help you avoid specific allergens."}

The actual taking of orders happened a little later.   I ordered the steak and eggs skillet, which was quite tasty. It would've been even better if it hadn't come 30 minutes after rest of my group's meals. It was unceremoniously dropped on the table with no apology or thanks for patience. Also, they serve steak and have no steak knives. Seriously!?   My partner ordered the chicken and waffles, which I'm pretty sure they pulled out of the frozen food section at Smith's. There's no way that chicken is hand-breaded in the restaurant.   Getting the check took our server another 20 minutes.    I can see where this might be a cool place for evening drinks and some light bites. But for brunch or any actual meal, it's really shitty."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "If I could give this establishment ZERO stars, I would. This was my third time dining at Park. It is Halloween night, everywhere is busy. My friends and I work at a casino on the strip and we decided we wanted to go have some food and something to drink to celebrate the holiday. We are locals and we can choose to go anywhere in this wonderful city, yet we chose Park. We ordered pretty much one of everything from the appetizer menu and we each had one cocktail. I would say total-we spent cumulatively around $150. The time was about 2:20am when we wrapped up, finished paying, and said our goodbyes at the entrance. I had to use the restroom and so did my roommate, so after hugging our friends goodbye I tried to walk back through the front entrance to use their restroom but I was abruptly stopped by the bouncer-Louie-or at least that was the name he gave us. He informed me that I could not go back inside because they were closing (they close at 3am and it is now 2:25am). At first I thought he was joking, so I smiled at him and continued to take a step forward. He placed his complete body in front of me and screamed in my face DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? WE ARE CLOSING I am naturally a pretty calm person so I said, well, we just had dinner here. Are you going to tell me that a paying customer may not use your restroom facilities? He then waved his arms in the air and continued to scream like a maniac toward everyone out front of the establishment OH, YEAH, FINE!! EVERYONE COME ON IN!! WE DON'T WANT TO GO HOME The manager was standing right there next to him and she did absolutely nothing. Since when is it okay to treat people like this? I literally just ate dinner here and you are not going to let me go pee? While he was having his conniption fit, I walked passed him and headed to the back of the restaurant-which was full of people by the way-and went to the restroom. I turned to see my roommate behind me. Good. So, we went to the bathroom and when we got out I noticed a part of the Park that I had never seen before. As I mentioned earlier, this was my third (and last!) time coming here, however I had never used the restroom and therefore never saw this garden back porch they have. My roommate, having been there more frequently than I, told me about a see-saw room as well. We started to walk through the crowd of people in the back of the restaurant to see this see-saw room. When we got back there, it was just that. An adult sized see-saw. How fun right? So, I jump on one side and she is on the other and we teetered and tottered a few times and I had almost completely forgotten how rude the security up front was. We then asked another patron to take our photo. Just as he was about to take it the manager (a lady) came back and said to my roommate and I you two that were (and she used air quotes) just using the bathroom-you have to leave NOW! And I said, okay we are about to leave, we just want to take a picture. And she screamed at us as if we were her four year old children, YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOOOOW!!!! And again, I said, we will leave after we take the picture. So she threatened me saying she would call security and I said as calm as ever, please do. I really just wanted her to walk away so we could take the damn picture. She then threatened us by saying she was going to call Metro. All of this harassment from the manager was in a matter of 1-3 minutes. It was still not 3am, which is their closing time. As we got off the see-saw, Louie was there again staring at us with eyes like daggers. I'm sure the upper management would be thrilled to know how the employees at Park treat paying customers. I've never been so appalled in my life. From the security out front not allowing paying customers to use their restroom facilities and then yelling about how he wants to go home, meanwhile the manager is just standing there allowing that type of behavior. I have worked in the hospitality industry for over a decade and no matter how annoying or rude or wrong a customer is, I have never-ever treated another human being that way. Where is your work ethic Park? Why do you treat paying customers like you are doing them a favor by letting them come inside? Park has the most unfriendly and rude staff I have ever encountered. I have never written a Yelp review before but this experience was so appalling that I felt compelled to. People should not treat other people this way! Especially managers! You have an example to set. Shame on you both!"}

We had a make-your-own burger and kale salad.  Both were as good as you'll get anywhere around town.  But the problem with the location is the $3-4 upcharge on all meals when the meal is worth as much as a non-Fremont meal.  The beer also stood at around $1-2 too expensive.

Secondly, it seems they always have the giant front roll up door open even on extremely hot days. If your going there between may and August, be ready to sweat!

When we had arrived around 12ish 1am, the hostess told us it was about a 45 minute wait for a table but seeing there was room at the bar, we sat at the bar immediately. As with most places in downtown, the establishment is kind of old and dirty and it being a bar, it was kinda dark too.  The bartender tended to us almost immediately after we sat down, giving us food menu and asked us for drinks. We had ordered some margaritas as well as use the check in offer for a free house margarita. We ordered 2 items of food to share as well.   Supreme Tostada Nacho - seasoned ground beef, cheese blend, yellow queso, refried beans, pico de gallo, fried jalapenos, lettuce, avocado lime salsita, sour cream & guacamole on top of house made corn chips - despite the price of the nachos, it is probably one of the better if not best nachos ive had. Granted i don't normally get nachos but with the few places i have, this is much better. Lots of toppings. Ground beef seasoned well. If anything, there was more toppings than chips. After the first initial chips, we started having to fish for chips. By the end, we asked for some forks to help eat. Lol   Grilled Mexican Corn on the Cob - basted in seasoning, cojita cheese, cilantro, garlic mayo and fresh lime - small pieces of corn. Maybe 1/3 the size of a normal corn. 2 per order. Expected more. Flavor wise was pretty decent. Would have been nice to have more cheese.   I personally ordered the Blood Orange Margarita whereas a friend ordered the White Peach version and another had the free House Margarita with yelp check in.

It was just my luck though that we chose the worst night to go. The backyard area was closed off for a wedding so we couldn't sit back there and the tables inside were reservations only, so we were sat on the front patio. This would've been fine if it wasn't 100 degrees last night! All of the servers were really sweet though and understood how hot it was, so they helped us out and got us a seat inside because one of their reservations got pushed back a few minutes so they said we could take the table if we could be done before the reservation. We thought that was really nice that they went out of their way to accommodate us.  We all ended up getting the Steak Tacos which were delicious! I had a big lunch earlier that day so I just wanted something small. It came with 3 tacos and they were the perfect size for a small plate. I also had one of their Moscow mules, which was very refreshing since it was still really hot inside the restaurant.  I definitely wanna go back, but will definitely make sure it's nicer outside next time!"}

They're definitely is enough room for a nice-size party. Park on Fremont was suggested to me by a co-worker so I decided to try it out Saturday for brunch however I left sorely disappointed. I ended up ordering a chicken and waffle sandwich which to me really tasted very Bland.  Honestly when it came out it really look like a piece of chicken in between Eggo waffles nothing spectacular that you can't make it home. The only reason why I'm giving this place a 2-star is because the wait staff was really friendly and very prompt and they had good drinks."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Park is a solid 3. If I'd drafted this the last time I went instead of this time, I'd have given a 4, but this time I finally made it during happy hour. Don't let it fool you; it's a horrible misnomer. The lower prices on the happy hour menu accompany what are basically half-sized portions, saving you no money at all on food or cocktails. At least the waitress warned us about the small portions before we ordered them & ended up even more disappointed. So basically, you're not getting better pricing for happy hour; you're just ordering tapas.  On previous trips, we've tried the chilaquiles (enormous portion, and really good!!); the San Diego burger (my dining mate scarfed it before I could try a bite, & says it was also really good); the chicken bar bites (if chickens had cojones the size of a great Dane, that's what these are -- no bite-sized bites here!); and the Philly mac & cheese sandwich (decently good, though I was expecting more mac & cheese... the other Yelp pics showed much more than we got on that trip). Based on all of those, and the service, which is normally pretty friendly and mostly timely, I'd give a 4.  This last trip, the waitress started out friendly until we expressed amused disgruntlement at the happy hour, and thereafter she was nothing but flat-lined personality with us, although I went out of my way to be upbeat & friendly with her. Apart from that, we ordered the fried pickles (which we've had before -- pretty tasty! They're cut into slices and are interspersed with fried pepperoncinis, too, as well as sometimes a whole jalapeño!), and we were excited to try the Cuban sandwich and the garden burger.  The Cuban was the most uninspired version of that meal that either of us had ever tasted -- the bread wasn't grilled & pressed, and somehow they took most of the flavor out of this inherently tasty mix of ingredients. The garden burger was the most bland veggie burger I've ever had (and that's saying something). Looking at the patty, it looks like it should be good, since you can see some black beans & tiny pieces of colorful veggies, but it seems like they used zucchini, maybe (or some other filler/black hole of flavor), for the rest of the patty, so the flavors were stretched too thin. They topped it with tomato, cucumber (which I love in the right context, but in this case it also just added to the blandness), and arugula (which, normally tasty, just got swallowed up by the blander ingredients as well). The super light basting of the chipotle mayo-like topping could barely be noticed. If I had to eat this dish again, I'd order an extra side of the stuff & slather it on to see if it made a difference. To get an idea of what a really awesomely executed veggie burger / bean patty tastes like, go to Rí Rá.  As a general note, the accompaniments for most sandwich & burger items are either fries (the seasoning is really good, and the ketchup is slightly spicy, yum!!), sweet sweet potato tots (that other sweet is in there for a reason -- they're topped with cinnamon/sugar, & while they're good, if you like sweet potatoes, we both felt they'd be better served as a dessert rather than a side for a savory dish), and a couple other things we've never bothered to order, I think cole slaw and a side salad. Some day I'll order the side salad to see what their dressing is like, but I'm not a fan of 98% of cole slaws.  We'll definitely keep coming back & trying the other plates Park has to offer, but we'll be avoiding the happy hour menu and those last two offerings. It feels claustrophobic sitting inside, but both patios are nice!"}

I was really excited about trying their Nachos, expecting something unique that would set them apart from typical Nachos at any other bar/grille.   They were certainly short handed, because we ordered our drinks and then after what seemed like forever, we had to find our server to make our order.  I ordered the Enchilada Nachos, my wife ordered the Vegan Nachos, my daughter ordered the chicken fingers.   It was alright. I kept thinking that I could have done far better myself. Maybe I just ordered the wrong item, but my wife absolutely hated her Vegan Nachos. So I tasted one of hers and the cheese tasted horrible. She almost asked them to take it back, but we couldn't find our server for so long that she ended up forcing down half of it by the time he came back around and it didn't seem right.  My daughter's chicken fingers were very good! At least they got that right.  So, if you're looking for nachos that make you say, 'meh', get the Enchilada Nachos. If you are starving and long for cheese that tastes like melted plastic, get the Vegan Nachos.  But if for some reason you find yourself in this average restaurant and you aren't the 'risk-taking' type, ask for the kid's menu and order the chicken strips. They are called 'pull my finger'."}

Our cocktails and water were served in those cheap plastic cups, not the mason jars that I've seen in pictures and reviews. Do they only roll them out at a certain time or for certain people? The drinks themselves were not bad. We also had some overpriced-for-the-portion chips and salsa  Could use some better service. My drink did not come out with everyone else's. Thinking that the bartender was backed up, I waited. After my companions were 70% finished with their drinks, I asked our server to check. 5 minutes later she comes back with it, no explanation why my drink took so long. Also, our water was not refilled, despite seeing our server go around with a pitcher every so often.

I made a reservation two weeks prior for 20 people. I called that afternoon to confirm the reservation. (yep, we have it, no problem!). When we arrived, no one seemed to know what we were talking about! Luckily, they weren't super busy, so they were able to set something up for us, but that definitely put a sour taste in my mouth to start.  Secondly,  the menu is NOT the same as what is posted online (only the Henderson location  posts their menu). This was especially disappointing because I'd already planned out what I wanted, but lo and behold, it wasn't on their menu. The menu of the Downtown location is much more abbreviated.   I ended up ordering the BBQ nachos, which were good, but the sauce was very strong, and there was a lot of cilantro. We also had chips & salsa. The chips were great, and the salsa very hot.   I also had a Raspberry Margarita, which was super sweet! I like sweet drinks, but this was even too sweet for my taste.    We also got an order of the s'mores nachos to share and sing Happy Birthday to me! They were okay. Just beware that the marshmallow sauce is REALLY sticky! Just passing it around the table, a girl got some of it stuck in her hair, and I know I got some  on my face and it was hard to get off!  The service was very friendly and casual, but I think they were a little strapped for servers (it looked like they might have only had 2 and 1 or 2 bartenders?), so they didn't come back to check on us and our needs too often.

There appeared to only be one waitress working and she had the inside tables and the patio. We watched the bartender chat up some people at the bar during the 20 min we were waiting for our drinks, then once he finally made them, they just sat there waiting on the server to pick them up. With all the bright lights and signs on Fremont, this place was kind of hard to find because it's not well distinguished compared to most other places. The taxidermy behind the bar was cool, the decor was very Victorian, but when you looked closer at the pictures on the walls, most were either bizarre taxidermy art or very unsettling, distorted old pictures of people.

The drinks section takes up half their menu. Bar food makes up the rest. We got the nachos because it's in the name so you'd think they'd be good. They were pricey but plentiful. This is a good place to go if you've got expendable income and you would rather blow it on a night out with friends instead of something sensible like video poker.

You think the waiters would be walking around with buckets of beers because, obviously, people are going to order a shit-ton of them at a time.  No.  Of course not.  My friend and I ordered four total.  And about 20 minutes later, we got two ... then 20 minutes after that, we got our other two.  Don't forget about the 30 minute wait for our three tacos which should be being made at lightning speed since that's probably the only thing being ordered there on Tuesdays.

For example, after the Neon Run, which ended in front of Park.  I was on the back patio.  It was full of runners who were hungry and thirsty.  There was one girl working the back.  She was cranky from being frazzled.  I had bottled water and since I was dying after my run, I pulled it out to drink while I waited to put in my order. I took one swig and security that was on the patio came and took it from me.  Wearily I said, I'm so thirsty and I just ran.    Sorry no outside drinks.  He said and took it from my hand.  I was to tired to protest.  I watched as he walked the entire patio, which was full of runners, and took water from everyone.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "We were highly disappointed in this establishment, especially after pointing at it all week and thinking that it might be a cool spot to have dinner.  Sigh, more fools us.  We came in on St. Patrick's night and the place was quieter than every other restaurant on the Fremont Street Experience, which should have been our first warning.  We ordered a pitcher of White Peach margaritas and the average burger nachos for me, Daddy's Supreme chicken taco for him.  Then we waited patiently, expecting the drinks to come out first.  No such luck - here comes the food.  I look over at my husband's plate and see this really sad-looking taco shell with a bunch of filling in it.  There was more plate than food, and I had a nasty feeling that the rest of the experience wasn't going to be much better than this.  My nachos, at least, had some substance.  But... they were just okay, not great.  The cheese sauce tasted like reheated Cheez Whiz, there was no bacon whatsoever to be found, and the onions were minced so finely that they just disintegrated the moment they touched my tongue.  I was bitterly disappointed.    To make matters worse, the margaritas came when we were nearly done with our food.  Bad, bad timing.  We were pretty much ready to pack up and leave by that point.  Once the drinks came, the experience was slightly better - but, hey, I got drunk.  If it takes getting me drunk to improve things... (and my husband will tell you that he has never seen me tie one on like that, ever)  Final insult:  the bill was 53 dollars, making it the most expensive meal we had in Vegas over the course of a week.  It wasn't close to being worth that.  My husband honestly didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I convinced him otherwise.    It never did get any busier while we were there.  I see why it didn't now.  The only reason why 2 stars - the food was edible and the drinks packed a punch.  But that's it. Servers were polite but in the end did nothing to improve our experience here.  Not recommended."}

Seating is comfortable inside & outside on the sidewalk patio or the garden patio. The beer offers lots of selections. Service is friendly, punctual, and efficient.  So why the one star rating? The food is consistently mediocre, but today's meal was the worst. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium well, served protien style, and not only was it burnt but the cheese was black. And the inside was raw.    The only reason I didnt send it back was because it felt like we were intruding & wasting their space even though we were the only table for over an hour. The buser took my silverware before I was done using the fork so I couldn't even eat the bacon, the waitress took my plate before I was even halfway done eating the sweet potato tots (which were delicious).   Sadly, I recommend skipping food & enjoying a drink."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "This place is only great if you are doing a pub crawl and it is a quick stop for a few drinks. I made the mistake of holding my birthday party here. With about ~20 attendees I made sure to make reservations weeks in advance. Things started off smoothly initially, the waitress was adequate. For a party that big, and considering the place wasn't swamped or anything (it was on a Thursday night), she did the bare minimum. Considering that she knew she was getting auto grat she felt no need to hussle. Also, why did they not designate a back up server for a party of that size? People were without drinks or drink refills for a long time. The food was overpriced and average at best. It took FOREVER to get the plates cleared and out of the way. When she realized she probably had already earned her 18% auto grat or whatever it was on a party that large, she pretty much jumped ship. You had to physically track her down, or wait a very very long time for her to come back around.  The place itself looks cool with some interesting detail, but at that point, the decor was all they had going for them. I would not come back here to sit down and eat, nor would I suggest it to others.. Sure, come through, get a drink from the bar, take in the unique yet highly hipster decor and move on."}

An off duty nacho daddy bartender with fire red hair that was a 1 person megaphone! Annoying, loud, obnoxious. Almost put her finger in my beer and musta thought we were all there for her cause she was at the top of her lungs the whole damn time. We moved to the other side of the bar and what do ya know-she followed us. We could not escape. She was gonna blow our eardrums out and with only 2 min left in the game we had to sit there and take it. Then, to our rescue, one of the bartenders seeing our despair called firey red to the other side of the bar. But she only made it halfway before she found someone else to scream at. We woulda enjoyed it much more as the staff girls were nice and lots of tv's. But lil red ryder blew our time to hell. Since she works there we prob wont go back as i assume thats her watering hole to.

Shabby, not chic, Nacho Daddy's a restaurant that feels and appears rundown. Music videos from the early to mid-2000's serenade diners as they crunch down onto their exotic nachos.   Kale Salad ($6.95): What a way to make someone feel like a heifer digging in the grass for the good stuff. This is an enormous bowl filled with kale and sparse toppings of avocado slices, chunks of grilled corn, and cherry tomatoes. Too much kale and not enough toppings. The dressing, which was an oily citric concoction, didn't add flavor.   Filet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos ($16.95): We paid 16 bucks for some bland-ass  nachos. Though they were loaded with guacamole, pico de gallo, refried beans, cilantro, and filet mignon,  these were disappointingly flavorless.   The carne asada nachos here don't even stack up to what my neighborhood Roberto's offers, or any kind nachos offered elsewhere.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I have been to Park several times, and my experience is always similar. First the good stuff. I've never had a bad meal here, and the cocktails are delicious. My favorite cocktail is the Pillow Talk, which is a light and refreshing vodka drink. The food ranges from classic bar food to yummy salads, so no matter what kind of mood you're in, they have something for your tastes. The ambiance is very cool. This place was definitely designed by hipsters--it's quirky and fun. I'm also a huge sucker for a nice, outdoor space, and Park's patio is adorable, although it is very close to a sewer, so you will frequently get whiffs of an unpleasant smell.   Ok, now the reason for only two stars. Despite the food, cocktails, and decor, the service is abysmal. I never go here if I need to be quick because I know that unless I'm the only party in the restaurant, I'm not getting out of here in under an hour. The servers are dismissive and nonresponsive, and I still would've given it three stars, but the last time I was there the service was so bad that it's brought me to Yelp.   We had a large group, and the first thing that happens when we are seated is our server spills an entire glass of ice water down the back of a member of our party. Instead of apologizing he throws a towel at her and runs away. He never returns to clean up. My friend goes to the bathroom to dry off, and I went to speak with the manager because I just didn't like the way it was handled (no apology, not cleaning up the spill, just handing her a towel and disappearing). The bartenders even told me the waiter ran away and was hiding over it. This should NOT have been this big of a deal.   So I spoke with the manager, and everything was fine, and she came over to our table when my friend returned and offered to comp my friend's meal and the party's first round of drinks. She also had a conversation with my friend separately where she stated this. However, when the bill came, she decided what was fair would be to only comp my friend's meal because she was the only one that had water spilled on her. She then claimed she never told us she would comp a round of drinks for the table despite 5 of us hearing her say it. Additionally, despite the immediate error, the service did not improve. We never saw our waiter after he brought our food.  Again, none of this would have been this big of a deal had he just apologized and helped clean up, if the manager had not stated she would comp drinks for us and then change her mind, and if we had just gotten some acknowledgment during our meal. I hate being a pain in the ass, but the way they handled themselves made me upset."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I'm willing to give this place a second chance.  There is a lot of potential with this snazzy, rustic bar/resto.  The reason I am giving Park on Fremont three stars is because of the service and SUPER LOUD MUSIC in the garden.    8:30pm Friday night - When we got to the restaurant, I told the hostess we needed a table for two.  She started guiding us to a table outside facing Fremont Street, so I asked her if there was a table available in the back garden.  She told us that if we wanted to take a seat in the front, she would come get us once a table was ready in the garden.    Twenty minutes went by, and the hostess (girl with long/straight/two toned hair), was nowhere to be found.  Seems as though she went on break and forgot about us.  After my guest and I were done with our first round of drinks, I decided to go up to the new hostess to ask if a table was available for us in the back.  The new hostess apologized that her coworker had forgotten about us, and then walked us into the back garden, where there were several open seats - why we weren't given a seat in the garden initially is a mystery to me.    The garden was exactly what I imagined it to be.  I wouldn't recommend taking older folks here, since the music is LOUD and some of the chairs are slightly uncomfortable.    I wish they had more apps on the menu.  It would be nice to order a few sides, rather than a large meal.  They have fries, etc, but nothing healthy.  I ended up ordering the veggie sliders - which were delicious.  The buns were stale, but the veggie patty itself, was delicious!  My guest had the corn flake crusted chicken and he LOVED IT!  Throughout the meal, our waitress was missing, a lot.  Our drinks were empty most of the time, and I even noticed the table next to us making loud slurping noises from their glasses (probably hoping to get the attention of a waiter).  The outside bar had a group of employees hanging around talking most of the time, so the issue wasn't understaffing.    I hope management reads these reviews, because I really want to like this place.  I am hoping it was just a bad night.  I'll be back soon to try it again, but if the service is still sloppy and careless, I won't be back.  I used to be a concierge at a major strip property, and I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending this place yet to anyone (until they work our these small, but large, kinks).  I hope I can come back here at a later time and update my review with more stars - like I said, I really want to like this place.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "You gotta love places like Park on Fremont because of what they are trying to do: Revamp an area and make cool what once was not so cool. I have to give them mad respect, just for that fact.  Owned by the same folks who own Commonwealth, this nifty little place has all the right elements to make it stand out as a contender amongst the other places popping up Downtown. They have not been open very long, so they might get more stars later on in an update if things change. But as it sits right now, I would have to say, come for the patio, stay for the unique beer choices.  The front and back patios are both great, but each one has a different vibe. The back is more chill, bigger and prettier. There is a smoking area with a see-saw and cool plants and flowers all over the place. It's a nice little reprieve from the craziness of Fremont St.  Ambiance inside is really cool, with a trendy and artsy sort of vibe. The front patio is louder, there are more people milling about, and you get to watch all the Fremont Freaks and Geeks wave their crazy flag proudly! I'm not hatin', I'm one of them!  The beer list is pretty extensive for a smaller place like this. They have everything from Coors and Mickey's Malt Liquor, to Young's Double Chocolate Stout and Lost Coast Sacramento Blonde. Honestly, you almost start wishing they sold beer flights so you could try a little bit of everything.  There is a cool beer and a shot combo option on the drink menu, which always seems like a fun concept, if you are in to that sort of thing.  One element I have not been so enthralled with is the food. The Sweet Potato Teeter Tots are really funky, but in a good way! The sweet mustard dipping sauce they include with 'em really adds that extra yum factor.  But a few of the dishes I have tried were just sorta ok. The first time I visited, I tried to order the Grilled Cheese on Brioche, which sounded to die for. It was 86'ed, which was fine, because it was their grand opening week and they had just had their soft open right before, so they had run out of a bunch of things. Not a big deal. I'll get it next time :)  Instead, I tried the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak, which was pretty tasty.   But the second time I visited, I was sad to see that they had taken that grilled cheese off entirely!! Sad, sad day. So I chose the Veggie Wrap, which came in a tortilla-type of casing.  It was just Eh. Kinda greasy, which sometimes is good, but not in this case. Not enough melted cheese, and not enough feta crumbles. Plus, the veggies were kinda wet.... Overall, it's been a little hit-and-miss with the food here. I'm confident it will more likely than not get better over time. Maybe I'm just being picky, or perhaps I have ordered the wrong things. Only time and more visits will tell.  But still come here! Sit at the patio! Especially out front. If you are a lady, you will get a couple creepy homeless dudes mackin' on you. Be prepared.

Mismatched indoor furniture - but outdoors, Haunted Mansion -esq paintings, string lights, and of course, the hipster holy grail: MASON JARS. If Peaches Geldof came back from the grave to design an eatery around her favorite Pinterest board, it would be Park on Fremont.  I've been to PoF 4 times. The biggest issue (other than the pentagram in the bathrooms, which is a huge turn off to even patronizing this place) is that it is so sunny outdoors. Okay, I get that it's cool to have an outdoor seating area, but it's Vegas and it is sweltering a huge chunk of the year. I've seen others who are already eating, pounce on unbused tables in the shade once people get up to leave. I've done it as well. Having to shield your eyes as you eat and sweat just isn't enjoyable. If there were more umbrellas, or even a semi permeable awning of some sort, it'd go a long way to making outdoor dining enjoyable.   Honestly, come during happy hour. The prices are significantly cheaper and the portions are the same. Make sure you check what is covered under the HH menu, drink wise, because I've paid $8 for a well drink that I assumed would be less than $3 based on the special at the time. The 1 lb of chicken wings for $5 and the garbage fries are really the only things I'd recommend. They're delicious. Skip the chicken & waffles which is heavy on the carbs, and lacking in flavor.   Service varies from the attentive, to having to go inside to ask where the check is after waiting, waiting, waiting. I've even ordered drinks that never came (and thus I didn't pay for them.) Whatever, PoF's loss.   If it weren't for the HH chicken wings, the egg topped garbage fries and the fun see saw out back, I wouldn't recommend this place. Oh, and even if you wear flip flops, be careful. Inside, the floors are significantly uneven and I've nearly face planted due to this safety hazard."}

The last person answered again, I said I wanted to talk to the manager, places on hold again for another few minutes. The manager answered, I spoke with her about how ridiculous it is to have to wait that long to try to pay for my food over the phone...the order vanished, however she knew it was supposed to be a bbq chicken nacho and a chicken fiesta nacho. She was basically having to retake the order, the computers are down I was told. I ended up just canceling the order because the amount of time it took for me to be on the phone, I could have walked down to Fremont street and eaten something by the time the order and delivery would have even happened. The only reason why I'm giving it a 2-star rating is because the manager offered me a gift card if I should decide to order with them again.  I can't even base my review of their food, it is purely all based off of customer service.

For this price point, and considering nachos are the main schtick, you'd think they could sprinkle and melt some cheese on the bottom layer.

When we arrived, the restaurant was occupied, but definitely not full or too busy.  Our server was friendly, but extremely slow.    We ordered the $20 bottomless mimosas and stayed eating our brunch and watching some basketball for probably about 2 hours.  In the span of the 2 hours of being there, we only got 3 mimosas.  Every time the server checked on us, we asked for another refill and it would take an extremely long time to get another glass.  The mimosas were probably 3/4 orange juice, 1/4 champagne.  I would say go for the beer and margaritas (which I guess should have been obvious, but I can't pass up mimosas after being hungover).  The beers came out in huge mugs and I believe were only $8 or $10.    My friends that ordered traditional breakfast items said the food tasted oily.  My vegan chick'n nachos were pretty good, though the fake chicken was hard to chew.  My boyfriend loved the shrimp nachos he ordered.  So the overall take from the table was that the food quality was okay.  It's a good spot to hang out, albeit a bit dark, but not a bad spot to catch a game with some beers and nachos.  Just don't expect fast refills."}

OK, I understand there is only one of you but I am a paying customer. I couldn't believe she said that. We ordered with her anyway because we were starving after that 5K. 15 minutes passed...25 mins...nothing came out and we haven't seen the server since. We stopped the busser and told him that we've been waiting and he took our order again. AGAIN. Another 20 minutes passed it just wasn't worth it to wait. I will NEVER come here again.

I have come for brunch twice and ordered food once after First Friday.  I have also been in to grab drinks from the bar on several occasions.  The first time we came for brunch our server was awful. First we sat at our table for about 20 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Finally our server comes over and it doesn't get any better.  It seemed like it was her first day serving EVER since she couldn't give a single recommendation on what to order and even messed up several of our orders.  We were a party of 6 and it took 30 minutes to get drinks.  Finally our food came out and the portions were quite small. Good luck on splitting checks here even if you tell the server you want separate checks in the beginning.  I know that servers hate that but Vegas is a tourist town and any restaurant should expect groups to come in and want to pay separate.  It took her about 45 minutes to split everything and finally bring us our checks.  I decided to give their brunch another try and came back with a party of 4 about 6 months later.  Same thing. We sat for about 20 minutes before our server came over.  She seemed rushed and had zero personality.  The food came out and the portions did not get any bigger.  Drinks took forever and so did our food.  We paid with 2 credit cards and just split it so it was a little easier on the server.  Both meals I was never thanked for coming in by the server or any staff member.   If you come in the summer months put on plenty of sunblock as there is little to no shade protecting you while you sit outside. I saw a lot of customers dripping in sweat.  We stopped in after first Friday and sat in a booth inside to get drinks and some food.  Again server was aloof and seemed hurried.  After seeing this on 3 separate occasions I would tell management to hire more staff or servers who are more experienced and don't seem so frazzled.  All that aside this bar is hip and fun and also has a secret seesaw in the back of the bar.  My advice: come in have a drink with friends and jump on the seesaw for kicks then head to the next bar.  If you want to grab a quick bite don't expect to be out in under an hour.  The fried pickles are good as well as the chicken and waffle sandwich. Overall there are much nicer brunch spots in Vegas that have better service, bigger portions, and tastier food."}

Don't get me wrong, its not a bad experience. Not at all. Its just that its reviews and reputation are over-blown I think.

Take notice Park on Fremont. It is NOT one of yours or your other customer RIGHTs to NOT be offended. You are a BAR. Nothing more, Nothing less.

Clearly the sort of place where cuisine is considered less important than booze and décor suffice it to say that the beer list and creative cocktails far outnumber the options for food and even with the extended brunch menu it was only in three items that myself and a friend could muster enough interest to indulge, the plates arriving in two rounds as we sat amidst a room awash in faux-taxidermy and paintings ranging from humping animals to possessed children with neither rhyme nor reason to be found.  Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac & Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream.  At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.'  Not exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac & Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub-grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer - a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S+O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each."}

Sought out the opinion of a friend who lives in Vegas for a place near Old Las Vegas where the 10 of us girls could go to dinner, while wearing our Bachelorette party tank tops and shorts and not break the bank. He suggested Park on Fremont and I took his word for it. Called first to see if they could accommodate 10 of us last minute and they said yes for the outside patio only. After walking in, there were a few tables scattered about inside, we checked out their outside and it wasn't for us, plus with the heat we wanted some air conditioning before heading back out into the desert dry heat. Our server told us she could see part of our group and as more tables got up, we could eventually all sit together. We were starving so we went with that option. Four of us sat down at a table and ordered some food to pick on so that our friends who weren't seated yet could come over and nibble what we had ordered too. Lots of fried stuff, which was unfortunate because after all of the booze we were drinking all weekend, it would have been nice to see some healthy food but anyways!  We got the crispy brussels sprouts, lots of oil but definitely delicious, sweet potato tater tots, also delicious. We got fried pickles, this intense plate of waffles fries, bacon and everything else unhealthy, mac and cheese balls. Fried junk basically, they call it comfort food for a reason. For the meal I went with the free bird, which was a turkey burger topped with some guacamole and arugula. I didn't love it, the flavor was a little off for me, but then again rarely do I find restaurants to do a turkey burger right. The annoyance came in when the bill was dropped. The server let the bride pay and that's just a no no. Clearly, she's in a veil, the only chick wearing white, maybe ask one of the bridesmaids first before letting her pay.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "What I thought would be an amazing experience for happy hour turned into a rather mediocre dining experience complete with garbage truck/sewage smell. The entire experience was pretty much ruined by this and had I known the stench would continually waft over our party while we ate I definitely would have chosen a seat outside.  But ah! The name is Park on Fremont, and the incredibly tack-full back patio is what this place is also about of course! Unless you are attempting to eat while foul sewage is creeping into your nostrils. Unfortunately this aspect is one I flatly refuse to lure myself into again. If I go back to Park on Fremont I will sit at the bar and leave the stinky patio be.  Food - Veggie Sliders of BORINGNESS. First off the sliders have the right idea, fresh enough veggies, interesting combo, but there was ZERO taste. It was bland, bland, bland and it came with NO sauce. No sauce at all. Um, not even like some veganaise? I'm not a vegetarian, but these sounded/looked yummy. They need seasoning. Please, for the love of all the is good - season the food!  Drink - Drink menu is pretty darn cool. Beer selection is cool. Although I was brought out the *other* raspberry beer that was in stock, rather than the one I actually requested. None the less - delicious. And at $10, I thought yikes! But when I saw it was a Pint I knew I would not even need another drink. My friend had one of their Bloody Mary's, which I tasted and it was yummy. Mixed very well. I would go back to have one in the future.  Service - Eh. Although our waitress was nice our drinks took a decade to arrive. Although she said she was waiting on the bar a few times to us - I can't imagine what the crap the bar was doing - basically, not making our drinks. It was not busy.   Ambiance - Again, sewage smell. Also, to begin with we were sat in the front of the restaurant on Fremont street and I wasn't thrilled. With the cars going by it just was not a nice place to dine. The inside was interesting, but the bar looked somewhat small.   Return Factor - I am turned off from their food, but I am intrigued with the drink menu and the drinks are what got the extra star for this review, or else it would have been a 2-star. I believe I will be back for drinks and I'll sit at the bar for sure."}

We walked into the bar with a group of 5 and the girl behind the bar (for a place that is open until 3AM) was acting like a rude you-know-what. I have been a faithful customer at Nacho Daddy for years and this was really disappointing. Because of this bartender alone, I and my friends will not attend this establishment. She worked at least from 11:30 to midnight tonight (11/25) pm, because someone in our group had to use the restroom, this bartender felt the need to attack us as we walked in the door. We will explain to our friends that this bartender alone is the reason that no one should feel welcome to this establishment. After an attempted explanation of our friend going to the bathroom, we were attacked and criticized for using the establishment for that reason and immediately left.  We will recommend to our friends and relatives that the location in Henderson is the more welcome location in town."}

Also, this review is for daytime service & food, not what it turns into at night.  The food isn't that special. At least it's not super expensive. The drinks are pretty good, fond of the beermosa and grapefruit beer. Mimosa brunch is kind of a joke, but I come from LA where mimosa brunch is a dime a dozen. I don't get how mimosa brunching is not a thing in Vegas...? They fill a 6 oz mason jar about halfway with your mimosa and our server took her sweet ass time coming back refills. What happened to leaving the carafe of OJ and the bottle of champagne on the table? We flagged down 3 different servers to grab us our 5th refill (prob the equivalent of our 2nd glass) and when our actual server came back she was like oh they already brought them! And we said we would gladly take the second one! (since y'all were sleepin on it). And this mimosa brunch is crazy expensive too, $20 for bottomless? I haven't found anything in Vegas cheaper than $15 for bottomless - out of control.   Those 3 stars represent decor and the fact there are 2 outside patios. I also kinda like how the inside is just essentially big hallway (with tables and a bar) that you walk through. There aren't really doors. Lame to like, but true. Everyone loves the back patio, and the see-saw. There was also live music when we went on Sunday afternoon around 2pm, which was nice."}

The place is small and cramped, and I think they could have alleviated that problem by making the bar just a bit smaller and instituting some smaller bar seats, as the seats take up to much room in the walk-ways.   Happy hour consists of $5 margaritas and $4.50 Mexican beers they have on draft. Not the largest selection for a HH, but not bad. There is food on the HH menu as well. I ordered the shrimp tacos and out they came as fried shrimp tacos, which I would have liked to have known and wish the menu would have pointed that out.  My friend and I also shared a nacho platter, ahem, since we were at a place called NACHO Daddy I had great expectations. They arrived in no time and were placed on our table. As I looked at this platter of nachos I questioned many things in life, When a tree falls in the woods and no one is around, does it make a sound?... When I am at a place that specifically has Nachos in its' name and I am unimpressed with the nachos... are they really nachos at all?  We got the Filet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos. I have reservations on whether or not the meat was actually filet mignon. I also have reservations now on ever ordering a $16.95 priced plate of nachos, which I expected to be bigger, and better.  Next time I want nachos I will go to Roberto's and ask for Carne Asada Nachos and I'll eat the &*&! out of those things and be happy I didn't pay $17 for them."}

After being super indecisive over where we wanted to have our late lunch, I realized I've had Park on Fremont bookmarked since I've never gone before, and so that was our final choice. Once you reach the entrance, they greeted us and asked if we preferred inside or outside, and because it was so nice outside, we choice out. The host led us to the seating area right outside where we had the entrance of the Fremont Experience right in front of us. I was a bit disappointed and upset because when I had looked at their yelp photos prior to coming in, I saw the beautiful outdoor seating in their garden. It was then that I realized they had two outdoor seating areas. (If I had known the patio she led us to was not connected to the garden, I would have requested to be seated in the backyard garden). Nonetheless, it was still nice and cute.   Food/drinks: So our waitress came and asked us what drinks we would like to start off with. Again, after looking through their yelp reviews and photos, I found that they served Banana Bread Beer and it was super popular (and because I LOVE banana bread, I was curious to how it would taste hehe). Sadly, when I requested for that drink, she said they were all sold out. I didnt prepare myself for a back up but she immediately recommended for me to try their organic strawberry beer, so I agreed. My boyfriend was okay with his first choice, and was happy. Yet, after giving my drink a try, the waitress asked me how I liked it....because she NEVER tried it before... Well, I didn't really enjoy it toooo much. It was okay, tasted like beer filled with strawberry syrup.. Um, I only decided to go with that because she recommended it to me and I trusted her! All along, she's never even tried it!! hahaha, if i knew, I probably would have picked something else on my own that I knew I would like. Oh well, at least I guess I now know how organic strawberry beer tastes like.. lol. Okay, moving on to the food. Since I was trying to go for something a bit light, I ordered the garden burger with sweet potato tots. The burger was a bit bland, but the sweet potato tots came with sweet honey mustard and omg I was addicted to that! hahaha. My boyfriend order the chicken and waffle sandwich with sweet potato tots as well. There wasn't anything really special about his sandwich, I wish the waffle was a bit more crispy.   All in all, Park on fremont is super cute and I love that! The food is just okay, BUT they have a wide selection of drinks to choose from (it just sucks when they run out, wahh!). Nonetheless, I still enjoyed my experience. Staff is very friendly!"}

Ended up here on the default it was a beautiful evening to be outside, and most bars nearby don't serve food.   We sat in the front picket fence patio which is good if you want to people watch the coming and goings of Fremont.   With drinks you can get a sampler of 4 mix and match drinks (signature cocktails or draft beers) for $20 which is not bad for a anytime of the day deal. Out of the drinks we tried the Wombat on Bathsalts was the better of them. One of my drinks, Pillow Talk, basically tasted like soda water.   I ordered fried pickle to munch on. This was actually pretty good and I liked the banana peppers were also battered and fried. It had decent seasoning and went well with the ranch. The portion though was measly though. I let a few people take a pickle and I had 3 bites.   The BF got a burger and it was not medium as requested but well done, no pink at all. It was also very dry and it didnt help that it needed a sauce. The sweet potato tots were not crispy enough, it barely had any crunch on the outside.   My brother in laws food was greasy and the garbage fries were really salty.  Service was okay. She was busy doing a full patio herself so times she wasn't around to flag I saw her running around for other tables so I can't blame her for it.   It's a A-OK place. I wish we got a table in the back garden so it would be nice garden ambiance, but the front porch wasn't a bad spot. The tall stools weren't so comfy to sit on though so try to sit on the tables and not the back tall table if possible.   Drinks and food could have better consistency standards. This place could be amazing as the spot and ambiance is right, but it falls short in serving quality."}

It was messy and the waffles were soggy, so it was impossible to keep the chicken between the waffles. I had to remove some of the chicken to even get it in my mouth. There was something that I thought was ketchup served with the fries, but after it made my mouth feel a bit on fire, I realized that was definitely not ketchup.

We brought a friend from BC for some food and drinks. Upon arrival there was a table on the patio with customers so we chose the opposite side after waiting a short time my wife went in and asked the Bartender if we could get service. Answer was yes. 23 minutes passed , no service so she went inside ordered 2 shots of Julio 42 and a Reposado.  Finally a server with Bunny ears came out and took our food order. Really piss poor service.  I get it.  Downtown deals with tourists equals crappy service.  Hopefully your new store in Summerlin will care about and cater to locals.  Will give it one last try.  Thx Earle We stopped in to check ND's out.  Heard about Nachos from watching it on the TV show Mystery Diners. Also a big sign out front advertising $5 tacos and $6 Titos  We sat at the Bar and had a great time talking with him. The day we dined was National Taco Day as well as Vodka Day. Go figure. Tacos and Vodka.  With that said.  Nachos had $6 Titos cocktails. So we had street tacos and Titos  Later that evening we decided to return with a friend for a cocktail. We ordered 3 Titos and service was really slow different bartender  took forever to pay.  Got the bill and the bartender charged us $9 a drink instead of the posted $6 price. After some discussion they finally adjusted the bill. Then sent a guy out front to take down the posted special sign.  Not sure if or when we will return"}

The crowd is great if you don't mind hipsters. Plaid shirts, boots, full-sleeve tats and beards...with music you probably have never heard of playing in the background. There's a song that was so not mainstream, Shazam doesn't even know what it is. Is the food from a local source? IDK. Does it have bacon? Yes. Do you drink from mason jars? Yes. Do you have doughnuts? Yes.  Bacon-Wrapped Corn Dogs: The more I tell myself I'm going to eat healthy food, the more I rebel. I like to wrap my arms around my legs in yoga and my corn dogs wrapped around with bacon. You get 2 big corn dogs served with Sriracha ketchup and a spicy mustard. The bacon is wrapped around the hotdog then dipped in batter - part of bacon enjoyment is the crispy salty goodness but you won't get that with this. 3/5  Philly Mac and Cheese Steak: This cheesesteak was actually good but there was just too much bread, not enough meat. Carbo-loading? This is for you. 3.5/5  Stranger Danger: Peach vodka and iced tea. If you like peach-flavored anything then, you might like this drink. I don't.  Trophy Wife: Rum, OJ, pineapple juice, lemon, simple syrup and bitters. This was pretty refreshing. Fruity and delicious.  They do have salads. Looking back, they do have delicious-sounding salads like Strawberry Summer Salad, Steak Salad, Ahi Tuna Salad, etc. But on my last night of drinking, I wanted to get something with more substance. On the menu, right below salads: deep-fried Oreo and Girl Scout Cookies, and Donut Ice Cream Sandwich!  If you don't like scary movies, stay away from the bathroom or you'll piss your pants.

Nacho Daddy is located in the heart of Downtown, Las Vegas, just a couple blocks down from where I work. I've tried several of their dishes and have never walked away with that wow factor. Their nachos are very satisfying, and they come with a heap load of toppings to ensure that every chip has some kind of yumminess on it. The BBQ nachos are the best, in my opinion.   I've tried their filet beef street tacos. The beef is cut into very small pieces, and then topped with a sprinkle of onions and cilantro. The food is then placed on two mini corn tortillas. The tacos do the job, don't get me wrong, but the meat was a bit overcooked to my liking, and I had to add a bit of hot sauce to keep the tacos moist. Again, not a terrible meal.     My favorite thing on the menu is their fish tacos. This is definitely a dish I would go back for!! The fish is slathered in herbs and spices and then thrown on the grill for good measure. The well flavored filet is then topped with cabbage and a little salsa, but the best part is the thick handmade tortilla it comes on. Everything works together well, and two of these babies will definitely leave you with a smile.   The service at Nacho Daddy is okay, and the environment is relaxing with a nod to the famous 90's bands playing on the TVs. All in all, I'll be back."}

We were told they are not accepting customers to be seated until 2:25pm because the kitchen was backed up and was trying to catch up on orders, however when we asked if we could sit at the bar, it was ok...Didn't really make sense but nonetheless, we found some seats available at the bar. I was already somewhat annoyed by waiting around but was so hungry at this point, I just wanted to order some food. There was only one bartender on staff at the time, and after another 7 minutes of waiting, the bartender apologized and said she'll be right with us. Nice gesture, however it would have been nice to have some menus to take advantage of the time we were waiting.  Finally, we got some menus, ordered some drinks (they have a free margarita with yelp check in) and ordered grilled wings and nachos for appetizers. The margarita was on the sweet side. Some of the wings were extra charred. I must admit, they do have several nacho options that all sounded great! We got the crab and lobster nachos. Flavors were there, but wish there was more to each bite. That being said, we would order this again. We ordered the baja seafood combo (fish taco and the lobster and crab enchilada with beans and rice), and the signature Taco-enchilada combo. Both of these dishes were extremely filling. Tortilla for the taco's were delicious and the enchilada was really good too. Prices weren't too bad either considering you're eating in downtown Vegas right next to Fremont St. At this point, we were stuffed and couldn't order dessert. Overall, the food wasn't too bad however our experience dropped this rating to a 3."}

I ordered the Anaheim taco which consists of Anaheim chilies, sour cream, sautéed onions, a blend of three cheeses, a slice of avocado all placed on a taco with scrambled egg.  The taco was not a flour one.  It was more like a pastry crust rather than a flour tortilla, but it was very good.  The menu says that all breakfast tacos are served with potatoes or refried beans and rice.  I was offered neither.  I did have a choice of mild, medium, or hot for the salsa and I chose hot.  It's mildly hot if that's not an oxymoron. Breakfast was good and the server refilled my coffee when he saw I was getting low.  This place just opened a month ago and they're still doing work on it.  This morning, they were installing a garage door in the bar area that can be raised in good weather and serve from a counter on which the door rested today.  Part of the fun of eating here today was watching my server change the Coke cartridges.  The syrup now comes in super concentrated containers that look like copy machine cartridges and it was interesting watching him switch out two of the cartridges. The change in technology was interesting.  I parked underground in the Neonopolis garage and there was no charge.  I don't know if it's because of the time of day or that I was there less than an hour, but this is the second time that the cashier at the pay station just wished me a good day and opened the gate.

I really felt like I stepped into an Urban Outfitters catalog once I walked through the bar and onto the patio dining area with its strung outdoor patio lighting, mounted wall plates that were probably thrifted, and the various pairs of shoes that were hung from a wire to indicate that the street pharmacist is just around the corner.   FOOD Veggie Sliders with Sweet Potato Teeter Tots: The Veggie Sliders were bland.  No flavor whatsoever. There was a thin layer of what looked like mayonnaise, but its flavor wasn't detectable at all. The yellow, sweet sauce used for dipping the tots into didn't help. I even requested some mustard to slather onto the mini, meatless patties. Again, no flavor. I concocted a mixture consisting of both sweet sauce and mustard. Still, no flavor. These sliders need their own special sauce or more seasonings because these were beyond dull.   The Sweet Potato Teeter Tots tasted similar to churros. They were sweet and a little crunchy. Its accompanying sauce was unnecessary.   SERVICE Our waitress did a good job at checking up on us often. Though, she seemed to exhibit hesitance after I requested mustard for my sliders.   OTHER The patio is lovely, and I like the whole feeling of outdoor urban dining. BUT, I wouldn't suggest dining out there. The stench of sewage and garbage tainted the air and wafted into our direction. At one point, one of the employees lit a stick of incense which wasn't strong enough to mask the overpowering odors.

My husband got a combo which was a 1/2 a sandwich and a bowl of the ghost pepper chili. My brother in law had the ghost pepper chili nachos. Both commented on the lack of heat in their meals. The shrimp bowl I had was fine, as was the quesadilla that my sister in law had. Nothing was exceptional though.

Mac & Cheese Balls were all mac and no cheese, unless the little plastic tub of cheesy-flavored dip served with them was supposed to be the cheese, and had a distinct artificial bacon flavor. Being only macaroni noodles in the fried balls, they were dry and bland and overall were a disappointment.   Chicken Bar Bites with their Honey Mustard sauce were plump and delicious and were served with excellent sweet potato tots. These were a winner.   After these two appetizers and a couple of small mason jars of Guinness at $8.00 each and house cocktails at $10.00 each we bailed and headed out for dinner somewhere else.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "First off, the food and atmosphere here is pretty darn good. I live in the area, so it's a nice place to bike over to and grab lunch. The patios are beautiful, amd the inside is comfortable. I love the San Diego Burger, and the Tacos are pretty good for a plqce that doesn't specialize in tacos.  I'm writing this particular review to talk about the service. When Park on Ftemont first opened, I had a number of great dining experoences, but recently the service here has been, for the most part, mediocre if not outright nonexistent.   In most cases it was simply that the servers had unenthusiastic attitudes, no smiles, and an apparent overall distaste for having to be at work that day. A number of the times the service was slow, and it was hard to get the servers attention without them seeming annoyed.   I understand that this is a pretty high traffic place in the evenings, and none of this is normally bad enough to mention. I mention it now because of the problem I had with the hostess the other day.  I was planning on going to take part in Taco Tuesday with some girlfriends, but I was interested in bringing my sister who was not yet 21. I called ahead to see at what time they stopped searing minors. Since I had been there before with my sister, and had even eaten inside, I thought I had heard the girl on the phone say she could seat minors on the patio after six. When we arrived I told her we had minors in our party and asked if we could sit on the patio. She abruptly and demeaningly informed my party that minors were not allowed here after six. When I began to explain I had called someone earlier, she broke in before I could even finish to say that was me, and I can't seat you. Taken aback, I turned around to walk out with my group. As we left, she mumbled Have a nice day. All as she sipped on what looked like some sort of mojito based on the color and the muddled mint in the drink.  I was aware that I may have misheard what she had said on the phone, but the fact that she was so unapologetic and just plain mean made me never want to go back.  I'm sure I'll get over it eventually because like I said, the food is good, but I'm not a fan of the exclusive, you're-not-worth-our-time, cool-kids only vibe the employees have been giving me. It makes me want to go there, and take new people with me, a lot less."}

I said oh we only get the special if we order a shot? He took a beer away and gave us a bottle of beer and said $20! WTF!! Umm that still doesn't solve the problem. I spoke up and said you said all the beers were on special. He mumbled something but basically used the excuse that they were busy as to why he screwed up our service.

She was unfamiliar with several of the draft beers. My Kellerwies made its way to me so no harm done. Drinks are served in mason jars. The selection is wide and varied. We got started with Mac & Cheese Balls ($7).   The description hinted at bacon in the Mac & Cheese, however, there was no evidence of smokey, salty bacon. The balls were rolled in panko and fried crisp. They lacked any pizzazz. The garbage fries were recommended by our server we probably should have tried those.   Sandwiches run $10-$12, we had the Cajun Chicken, BBQ Burger and Philly Mac & Cheese. All were edible, but none really shined. The sweet potato tater tots are good, but the sweetness becomes cloying after a few. It's best to check out Park on Fremont for drinks and maybe a snack. If you're looking for meal, there are better choices to be had."}

I doubt my friend was really banned and if she was then that I should've been allowed to stay. A manager should've handled that."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I'm going to start off with the rating. Most reviews give it 3.5/5. As much as it pains me I have to agree with the rating. The saving grace in this restaurant is the incredible food. It was our first time there so we have no clue to wait for a hostess or just sit where we please. It has the potential to be a very hip hangout if they didn't shove their merchandise down your throat. After we found a table in the small eatery we finally got to order, our choices were the beer battered lobster tacos and the fajita cheese steak. The lobster taco was on point. I was surprised that even smothered in sauce the lobster stayed crispy and delicious. Covered in fresh avocado, corn and lettuce it comes with beans and cheesy rice.   The fajita cheese steak is tasty but very greasy ( those with sensitive stomachs eat at your own risk) the bread was soaked with queso so it was difficult to eat. It only comes with fries but they were amazing in my book. I love a good pile of crispy fries. I would have liked to try the drinks and shots but unfortunately most are over priced. They have huge portion sizes but you end up paying for it.   As for the service it was not great. The waitress acted like she hated her job and didn't want to be there. Not to mention alot of things were left unclean and dusty. Like I said earlier I agree with the 3.5 rating. Perhaps in the future I can change my review. Love, Bug"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "2 Stars is what I am giving the Park. Let's break it down.   Pros: Let's talk about the good qualities of the Park. This place is super cute and has great style. Very mellow vibe, chill atmosphere. Cute patio seating. I recommend ordering the mimosas  Patio Pounders. The orange juice was really good and they bring your bottle of Prosecco on ice in this cute clear bag. They bring you some cute small mason jars to sip from. This was my favorite part of the experience.    Cons: Now, onto the shortcomings. The staff, definitely needs some fine tuning. When we approached the hostess she seated us immediately, once we were seated on the patio, it took 15-20 min. to take our order. Common, after a long night of drinking in Vegas, we were really hungry! 15-20 min feels like an hour. While waiting for our server, we smelled garbage, i guess it was garbage day in the lot next to the Park. Sitting and waiting on someone to take our order while smelling garbage is a horrible combination. My patiences were being tested at this point. I had to flag down a server to ask where our server was, seems like both servers didn't communicate as to who will serve our table.The food, wasn't anything special. We ordered Chilaquiles-never seen a version like this one before (everything came separated), Mini Corn dogs, Mac & Cheese balls and a burger. It was 3 of us who all ate and shared. The food wasn't as hot as I would like it to be, the oil they used to cook the food tasted old and upset our stomachs. The steak that went with our chilaquiles had a ton of fat on it, was super tough, chips seemed store bought. My friend asked for a diet Coke 2 times, as they forgot to bring it to her twice. We spoke with the manager and told her our concerns she was nice enough to take the items off the bill, I appreciated that. She was very apologetic about the situation.  Summary: Very cute place and has all the potential to be a great restaurant, has the look, but the food needs to be better. Better staff and more staff is need. It's all about ambiance, food and service. They missed the mark on food and service, which so very important in the restaurant biz! Would I go back? Ehhh probably not."}

I love Taco Tuesday and am in fact going tonight.   But, the happy hour (if you want to call it that) is a joke! There are no deals here, so if that's what you are seeking, look elsewhere. You are supposed to get a deal for happy hour, that is the whole point of it. They really had us scratching our heads when they gave us the discounted price, but then served us a mini version of the normal size drink! So, you are paying less, but also getting a lot less! It's insane! Not a deal!  So Park, I suggest doing a real happy hour menu, instead of serving customers those stupid mini-sized drinks and pretending that is some kind of bargain. People are better off paying full price and getting a decent sized drink. That is not what happy hour is, and definitely not making anyone happy!"}

We kept eating because we still had our drinks. I would say we left over half of it there. It's mostly a 20-30 year old crowd, so maybe that's part of the 4 stars. If your namesake is your signature dish, I thought it would be unforgettable. Wish I had taken advantage of the check-in margarita, though. Not in a hurry to go back.

Granted it was a really busy night and it was one of the few places that weren't charging people to get in. (Seriously DTLV?)   My boyfriend and I sat ourselves at the largest table available in the main room, yeah it was only 2 of us at the time of seating, but we were waiting for 2 others to join us. We sat around for 10 minutes, while all the waitresses ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. I don't know if their manager doesn't know how to properly assign sections (with them running in and out of the room to the back, but it seemed like they could barely handle the large volume of people). We waited and waited, made eye contact with several people and still no service. I urged my boyfriend to go up to one of them at a computer putting an order in, and she proceeds to tell him that she's cut. First of all, I'm a server at a high volume restaurant on the strip and I completely understand how annoying it can be when you're super busy and the last thing you want is to add another thing to do to your list of many, but how hard is it to tell a customer, let me find a waitress/server who can help you. ??? Not that f*ing difficult.   I was pissed and got up myself, looked for someone who would be standing around doing NOTHING (usually managers) sure enough I saw a gentleman standing behind the bar just people watching and walked directly to him and asked him if there were any servers serving the tables in the area because we had yet to be acknowledged. He pretended to act surprised as if he himself didn't see us either, and pointed at the girl... where else, AT THE COMPUTER. Hmmm, really?? All I wanted was to order drinks, shots and a side of french fries. EASY! I'm not a tough customer especially when I can tell people are overwhelmed. She drops our shots off (chocolate cake) no lemons and no sugar. I'm not a bartender, but I'm sure everyone knows they come with both. We ask her for both, walks away. Comes back with a few lemons in a cup and 2 packets of sugar and tosses them on the table and walks away. LITERALLY WALKED AWAY. No, is there anything else i can get you? no nothing. I was so pissed. I assured my boyfriend and our guests that she wouldn't return until one of our cups were empty or all of them, and I was right. We got our ticket, left no tip and thats exactly what she deserved. I never leave bad tips, but wow service was an embarassment.  Such a nice place to go if you want to just look around and enjoy the decor, go straight to the bar yourself or else you'll be getting crappy service. Park on Fremont, really need to reconsider the type of people their hiring. Yeah they're pretty and attract a bunch of drunk, high paying customers.

Instead, there were little cubes of dried out chicken. I expected some enchilada sauce to be mixed in with the chicken, but instead the nachos were a wet, greasy mess. Enchilada sauce had been dumped over all of the chips. I ate about a quarter of the food. That was all I could stomach. I ended up having a sour stomach for nearly three hours after the meal.  My friend had what she always has - the Big Daddy burrito. She loves it. When it came, it was obviously smaller than what it had been in the past. She stated that they must have changed the recipe because it just didn't taste the same. In the past, they always had brought a small plate with sour cream and lettuce on it, too. She asked to speak to the manager who came over after we had completed the meal.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I really love everything that's going on around East Fremont; with all of the new bars and restaurants the scene is really coming together. But along with all those new venues comes droves of hipsters almost as intolerable to me as the droves of tourists on the Strip, so I tend to visit this area during the day for lunch and weeknights. My impatience aside, the downtown area needs great food to go with its great bars, so I was very excited to hear that the new Park on Fremont was going to be serving more than just snacks. Billed as a gastro-pub, this recently abused word suggests a fancy array of snacks and main dishes to go along with a large drink menu. But can this suggestion truly become a reality?  Park has recently opened, taking over the failed 18+ hookah lounge that was there previously in a prime location on the corner of East Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. It sits alongside another neighborhood newcomer Radio City Pizza, and all of the other popular First Friday spots that have quickly taken over the scene with long pretentious lines to get in. I hate waiting to get in to places on the Strip, this new development of ropes and lines on Fremont is a bit much, even as 'cool' as some of these places might be. The interior of Park is quite odd, and I'm not quite sure how to explain it. Striking wall coverings, cool art, and stuffed birds decorate the interior dining and bar area, with a small patio up front and a large outdoor 'park' in the back complete with an adult teeter totter and plenty of lights. I went during the day so the inside was more than fine, although I'm sure the outdoor area in the back looks much better at night. While their menu has some interesting sounding items, it's kind of all over the place and I've heard most sound better than they actually taste. Options like a fried chicken and waffle sandwich, Philly mac and cheese steak and a corned beef Reuben all sound tasty, if not unhealthy.  Either way, I'm not here to report second hand information, I'm here to tell you about my burger experience. And in this case, it's their stuffed burger with Monterey jack and cheddar, and applewood bacon. Upon picking it up I bit into my dry bun with a really cold spot in the center where the pickles were sitting. What's with all the cold buns lately? The meat had no decent flavor on its own; it wasn't bad but it wasn't seasoned or presumably anything special. There was surprisingly some pink to the meat, which is a rare sight for a stuffed burger given how much longer they usually have to be cooked, although given the unknown quality of the meat I'm not sure if this is a good thing. The bacon inside was soggy and took away from any cheese or onion flavors, which weren't anything too great either. The lettuce, tomato and onion on top were fresh and ok, but overall there was nothing special about this burger which was surprisingly dry despite being stuffed with so much.  The fries were nothing special either; of the larger cut variety, but soggy and barely at room temperature. It seems like the reports I've heard are true: everything here looks way better than it actually is, which is surely unfortunate as I really want everything that opens in this particular area to be great. Still, I'm sure it will do just fine as this food is probably more than acceptable for the drunk crowd that takes over East Fremont all weekend. Just not for the overly critical like myself. $12 for a stuffed burger and fries is a reasonable price, I just wouldn't recommend it when you have better options close by at Triple George and newly opened La Comida (review for their really good burger coming next week)."}

I mean, what bar in their right mind throws out 40 people on a freaking Tuesday? Park on Fremont, that's who. After Julie kicked out said party planner 30 seconds later and the place was empty. However, the bar across the street was more than accommodating.   I only hope the owners can see that Julie is bad for their business. Take your business elsewhere until PoF can clean up their act."}

We were seated in the beautiful patio in the back so i had hopes for a very pleasant experience again. Oh to dream.  My friend ordered a grilled cheese and apparently they no longer make that but it's on the menu.  I had to be wild and crazy and order iced tea just to find out they don't carry iced tea.   We changed our orders and i ordered a burger with cheese and mushrooms.  When it arrived, it had avocado on it.  I thought i had forgotten to tell the server to leave it off the burger but when i reread the menu, it didn't say it had avocado.  I waited about 8 minutes and flagged down the food runner since our server was no where in sight.  I then asked her to have it removed and she told me she had ordered the wrong burger for me.  When my burger finally arrives, it had a very small amount of cheese but the mushrooms and bacon were no where to be found. I actually took it apart to verify they weren't hiding somewhere and nope, no mushrooms.  Needless to say, i will not be returning to eat.  Maybe i'll give you guys a try for a cocktail but after that fiasco i'll have to let the memory fade and hope that time heals all."}

I ordered chicken and waffles. I expected bar food, based upon the menu. What I received was an old, freezer-burned toaster waffle that was microwaved with tough chicken tenders that were breaded years ago in Arkansas at the cheesy Tyson plant (and that is a compliment, trust me).  Yup, really poor excuse is you like this type of meal.   Margueritas are one shot of bad Tequila and 16 oz. of lemonade in a Mason jar. Looks delicious but the result is poorly executed sweetness with absolutely no similarity to a margarita. Oh, they charge $9 for this lemonade, too!

It was so refreshing to see trees that were not cactus, as if you really were in a park on Fremont!   Our server Liza was very friendly and it was with her that I finally fulfilled a childhood dream when I ordered a cocktail and said, I will have the Unicorn, please, the Unicorn being a ginger beer & vodka cocktail - pretty much two of my favorite beverages in a glass. Liza was attentive and on top of the ball the whole night, so props to her! We were three of those girls boys hate to take out and all ordered salad - two of us got strawberry balsamic salads and the other ordered the steak salad. The greens were crisp - not limp at all, while the bleu cheese crumbles were not too overpowering, the portions of chicken were generous, the candied walnuts were crunchy, and the strawberries gave it just the right amount of a sweet kick.   The food hadn't even hit the table when we noticed a sewage stench near our seats against the wall that separates Park (is it okay if I just call you that?) with Radio City Pizza. We tried to do our best and give Park the benefit of the doubt, knowing that this is probably out of the restaurant's control, but then it also became noticeable that the music was TOO loud. I was in the middle of yelling about the onset of my quarter-life crisis to my friends when of course the Kings of Leon song in the back ended right as I was shouting, AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE! Great. I might as well have just megaphoned this news to the whole restaurant.   Until the noise is controlled in the back (is it like that in the front too?) I probably won't think too much about grabbing a bite there, but otherwise this could be a great place to post up for a beverage - the generous pours into mason jars means I made the right decision to have skipped the Strip to imbibe more for less."}

It took a while for us to even get menus, then for the bar tender to take our order, and then the bartender forgot our drinks order, so we had to ask someone else, and then the bartender didn't put in our whole order (even though we only ordered 2 things), so they we had to wait for them to bring out the salsa... The salsa was mediocre and the guac was underwhelmingly plain. The chips were actually pretty good. The margaritas were also mediocre.  And then we had to go through this cycle again of trying to find someone to give us the check. We were going to pay with credit card, but it took so long that we ended up just paying with cash and leaving.  Ambiance-wise, this seemed like a pretty mediocre Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican joint. Also, they had some interesting choices for their TVs surrounding the bars. One had infomercials, just infomercials: vitamin supplements, prostate issues. Another TV had cartoons. If you're going to make your customers wait indefinitely, at least put something interesting on TV to keep them entertained."}

We were also in the mood to have some margaritas so we figured perfect! We ordered our fiesta nachos and the nacho burger nachos or something like that, both of which were super yummy. We had a super nice server named Luis who gave us great service and sold us on not getting individual margaritas. He said we'd be better getting the pitchers cause we could get 4-5 margaritas each for less price so we were like done! Took 2 pitches between 5 of us. When he came out pouring the first pitcher it only filled up 4 of them just over half way. He had to use some of the second pitcher to fill ours more but then stopped half way through the second he realized we were clearly being shorted. He left with the still half pitcher and came back with it filled back up. In the end we all only had 1-1.5 drinks each. One of my friends asked for a manger and explained to him the situation and just felt like we were a little shorted and we were really nice about letting him know. Honestly we probably could've gone without even mentioning it and leaving barely satisfied with the situation but we decided let's just let him know. The first thing out of his mouth when we explained to him he said so you only had 1 1/2 drinks each? That's hard to believe. Ok no big deal. We just elaborated and he seriously did not care AT ALL about it. He was like well I sent you out a whole new pitcher and we were like well you took the half filled pitcher back first and just filled it with ice. After the shortest discussion ever he literally said ok well have a good night. I work in a customer service industry as a manager and it's our job to, even if there's not much we can do, to make sure the customer is happy. I'm not exactly sure how he was trained as manager or if customer service is of ANY important to Nacho Daddy but that was my first experience with the company and it's left a sour taste in all of our mouths because of it. The managers name was Rob apparently and I can't express the extent of how he just could not be bothered with us and in no way were we those kind of customers. We just wanted to let him know and he gave two shits about it. I don't know if any of us will come back, who knows.

It's always annoying when places advertise their happy hour menu to get you in the door and then the servers seem so displeased with you for ordering from said menu. After we placed our order, we barely saw the bartender for the rest of the time we were there. It took us about twenty minutes to flag her down and get the check when we wanted to leave. We were forced to hang around even longer because she mistakenly didn't charge us the happy hour prices for our drinks. She made sure to make several other customers drinks before fixing our receipt. If you aren't going to treat all of your customers well, you should just get rid of happy hour.  The house margaritas were unsurprisingly mostly simple syrup.

Unfortunately we had Ryan as a server who tended more to the smaller brunette Hostess then his tables along with our table. We were unattended for so long when it was not even busy that we went to the bar to get a drink. Since we already had a table the bartender with the dreads assumed that I would not tip her because I was not sitting at the bar so I was giving an attitude about ordering a drink from her. Lucky for her I'm a decent human being and I understand that this is a service industry and tips need to be given as I was a bartender for four years. After convincing the bartender she can give me a separate check for the drink I went back to the table and watched Ryan from afar at the hostess stand. In the end I see there is a lack of management at the restaurants as if a manager was on the floor they would notice the lack of activity from their server.

So it's 1:05 right now and mind you we got there at noon and we just got our food, it was cold. What a surprise. It tasted like it was sitting under a light because our server forgot about it. So we ask to talk to the manager and with very little obvious interest she asks what's wrong and we inform her of our situation and to which she replies she's busy WOW thank you so much. (It honestly seemed like she didn't want to talk to us because we were the only minority's there. which if that were the case shame on them).SO we have been waiting an HOUR and that's all you can say. No sorry, no i understand your frustration just she's busy and if she was that busy then why didn't another server help her out? Not very nice of her coworkers. Honestly the worst server and manager did not care at all. And to top if off the food was mediocre. If I could give this place a zero I would. It's only popular because of the aesthetic."}

The restaurant is right outside of the Freemont Street experience and container park. If you are looking to check out these areas this is a prime location. The decor was also adorable. I loved all of the succulents and greenery, the hanging chandeliers, the taxidermy, patterned wallpaper. Basically hipster paradise and reminded me of almost every restaurant I visited in Austin.  Unfortunately food and service was just so-so. The waitress gave me an attitude when I asked to sit outside and when I asked if there was an option to look at the lunch menu in addition to the brunch. We sat outside at one of the few front tables, and when I went to the bathroom I discovered that there was a beautiful courtyard with a ton of seating. It would have been really nice to be given that option - especially considering it was fairly empty when we arrived because they had just opened.   My wings were rubbery and not crispy at all. My fiance's loaded tots were topped with so much queso that the tots basically just turned into one big mush. The chicken in the dish was rubbery as well. Not sure if we made bad picks or just mehh food... but we were not satisfied. Best part of the meal was the 20 dollar bottle of champagne that came in a plastic shopping bag. So. Hipster. But that's basically like 5 or 6 mimosas for 20 dollars which is a steal.  If I'm ever back in the area I'd probably opt to eat elsewhere, but for a drink on the back patio (hopefully in the back) I'd love to return."}

After engaging in a line of beer questions with 3 different employees, I learned that all they know are buzz words and basic beer slang.  The beer list is only mediocre and of course, STUPID over priced. The beer is served in cans... Classy, right?? And when I asked for a pint glass, I got a dirty look... then, I got a dirty mason jar... Then, I stabbed my thigh with a fork, which felt better than paying $7 for a can of beer, that I had to pure into a filthy mason jar myself. Pretty offensive all around.  Every drink we ordered took two stops to come out... which is odd, because again, they are CANS OF BEER!!!  The food is VERY good and quick. (based on my experience) My table had mixed reactions on the quality of the food and the value. I would suggest bringing in a flask and trying the chicken bites. Sweet Potato Tots!! Do IT!!  My visit ended with a request for a beer and a my check. Neither came out on the next two stops. I asked her to cancel the beer and just bring the check. She said that she couldn't cancel the beer, because it was already up... To reiterate, she told me that, because my CAN OF BEER was already on a counter somewhere, I could not cancel it.  Then, she brought me a check with items that other people at the table had ordered. Frustrated, running late, and only buzzing, because I wasn't going to deposit any more money here, I signed the CC slip and left... Sober...   Bars shouldn't let their patrons, especially those with reckless spending habits (me), leave sober... It could be very bad for business."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "So I've had this place on my Yelp bookmarks, and this used to be one of my favorite downtown spots, which is why I wish I could give this more stars. This place has some pros and some cons Pros -The decor is amazing.Theres a bunch of weird/cool looking decor on the wall, and their patio is quite possibly my favorite in all of Vegas. When I'm in there, i completely forget I'm in vegas because back there it feels like I'm in 5 different cities. -The drinks are generally pretty good. I appreciate when effort is put into a drink, and they are good for that. The mules are definitely toppers  -The Philly Mac n Cheese, and the Mac n cheese balls. I never realized Mac n cheese and Philly Cheesesteaks were such a perfect pairing until here. And their Mac n cheese balls are quite ridiculously good. I tip my hat to you Cons - Even when I used to come here on the regular, I was never a fan of their taco tuesdays. their tacos were decent, which isn't a big deal on either way because they're not a taco shop. I did however have an issue with the baby Dos Equis they used to give us. I mean it was like a gulp and a half. I perused the page and wasn't able to see any mention of taco  Tuesday. -I tried the chicken and waffle sandwich recently, and maybe its just me, but It wasn't as good as i remembered. I can't quite put my finger on what was different. Maybe it was the waffle or the chicken, but sad face from me. -Lie I said, the drinks are mostly good, but there were a few I wasn't a big fan of, but thats completely suggestive -People complain about the service. I'm not really going to because its been good and bad, and theres been times when there was a wait to get drinks and stuff, but it wasn't on the server so I try to not do that.  Overall, theres good and bad, I love the ambiance, but idk if thats something that necessarily holds. Two things that do intrigue me to try and check back in with them are the garbage fries; I somehow don't remember ever eating them but a lot of people are raving about it, and the twig and berry. I don't know if its new or if its always been around, but Its definitely something that looks to be worth a try and is part of the good parts of this place"}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "A lot of great, but also some not so great.  First, the great.  Location and atmosphere are fantastic.  Nice setup.  It reminds me of downtown where I am from so I had a particularly home like feeling being there.  The music was also on point.  Overall a great feel here.  The shooter made with Absinthe is by far the best drink made with Absinthe that I have ever had.  A very difficult feat, because as a main ingredient absinthe is hard to make tasty.  Absinthe, despite all its hype, tastes like ass.  This shooter however did not.  I believe it was called the Funderwear.  I could do more of these, and they could be dangerous.  Also the shot/beer combos available are a nice touch, and something I will be coming back specifically for.  The beer list itself, needs to be reformatted.  There is no organization to it at all.    The specialty cocktails were decent, but a bit lacking in complexity, and a touch on the sweet side.  They weren't bad, but they also didn't jump out as very memorable.   Then there is the bad.  The Veggie sliders are a complete disaster of a dish.  I am curious if the people making them have ever actually eaten them.  Sliders 101: ALWAYS TOAST THE BUNS.  Serving sliders on untoasted buns is culinary blasphemy.  The patties weren't cooked very well, and overall they had a slapped together feel to them.  The tots that accompanied were added insult to injury.  They taste as if they are either dusted with confection sugar, or semi-battered with funnel cake batter.  Applause for the shot at uniqueness, but simply a sad moment for anyone who enjoys tots.  I have NEVER not eaten all of my tots before.  I am a fatty when it comes to tater tots.  I will devour villages and small cities worth of tater tots.  Generations upon generations of tots have been simply wiped out by me.  I couldn't muster the will to eat more than 5 of these and all 5 were eaten somewhat forcibly.  My natural instinct to love tots was thrown into a distraught mess of confusion.  Tater tots should be crispy and crunchy on the out side, and warm and plentiful with hot fried potato goodness on the inside with a touch of salt.  You want to get crazy, add a spice to them(Cajun maybe?), or a unique sauce on the side.  For the sake of all that is delicious, ditch the funnel cake version, please.  This was the only dish we had, but I have heard similar criticisms from foodie friends of mine about many of the dishes here.  Just because you are downtown doesn't mean you can slack on your food.  You are in downtown Vegas, one of the biggest food epicenters of the US.  Your biggest target market is locals, and the locals in Vegas are foodies for the most part.  We will wait for food, and we will pay for food, but it needs to deliver.  You have such a great location for what you are offering, take advantage of it.  The servers were very friendly and engaging, as well as the hostesses.  Whoever did the hiring of the FOH staff made solid choices.  Very refreshing after eating at some places with impersonal and seemingly unconscious staff lately.  I do hope the food improves, because I really enjoy the vibe here and that location is in need of a great spot to eat at."}

First, the hostess basically told us that she wanted us to sit at the bar (a lot of tables were dirty and the bar was empty with bartenders ready to serve). I thought it was odd, but I've worked in restaurants so we sat there even though we would have preferred outdoor seating. When we sat down, we didn't know what drinks we wanted yet, but said we definitely wanted fried pickles. We ordered drinks a few minutes later. We started to notice everyone around us was getting their food so my friend asked about the pickles. The bartender said the order was in and then asked what we ordered again. Then he said Oh no, I'm stupid and put it in the computer right next to him. No apology! Then, it took about 15 minutes to get the pickles. We asked for them to go, but they came out regularly. Another bartender took over our order and charged us the $8 for the worst fried pickles I have ever had. It took him 5 minutes to get the check prepared and another few to run the credit card as he was busy making drinks for other customers."}

When it finally came out.. It. Was. Terrible. It was dry and kind of burnt. The turkey on the inside was extremely dry. The taste overall made me a bit nauseous - it was that bad.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I went here a couple of weeks ago for lunch. We dined at the down town location. Cute name. Clearly marketing to the tourists as there is a bar that opens to the street. Medium sized dining area. What put me off almost immediately is when I went to the website lunch specials were listed. However, when I went there the waitress new nothing about it and asked the manager, the manager then came over and explained that the lunch specials were only for the Henderson location and not downtown. I will own up that it was my mistake upon review of the website again when you download the menu it states Henderson menu and when you scroll down to the very bottom then there is a cover sheet stating Las Vegas menu that does not list lunch specials. Nonetheless, this left a bad taste in my mouth.   As to the food, a bit pricey in my opinion for what you get. I will admit that I am a nacho snob - I love nachos and if I am going to splurge they better be darn good. I like traditional nachos piled high with gooey cheese (love the nachos at Big Dog's) and avant-garde nachos such as the asian nachos at Grand Luxe. The nachos sounded good, we ordered the cheeseburger nachos and bbq pulled pork nachos. The queso sauce was smooth and creamy and the pulled pork was sweet although not great bbq but I didn't expect that from here.  Cheeseburger nachos, well, were like a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, ground beef etc. They were approximately $10 each. They were good but again nothing phenomenal and for the price not a whole lot there. I was full but had I been any hungrier would not have been. And I am pretty sure other people in the group were not full. There were three plates of nachos shared among four people.   They had one of those new help yourself Coke machines with the different flavors. Overall I have mixed feelings about the Coke machine. You have to get your own drink which I am okay with but if there is anyone standing at the drink machine you may be in for a long wait as they ponder their drink selection.  Anyway, cute idea but I won't be coming back."}

The French toast ($10) lacked a good sear and was soggy -- unable to hold up to the custard it was soaked in. Topped with mixed berries, it was an unspectacular dish. Even worse was the fried chicken and waffle sandwich ($11). A thick, oily breading coated strips of breast meat and were sandwiched between soggy waffles. The best of the items we tried were the mac n cheese balls ($8). Five per order and coated in a light layer of panko breadcrumbs, the mac n cheese inside wasn't half bad when compared to the other dishes.   The almost-garish decor makes for a good conversation starter and photos. Who doesn't want to see a classically painted portrait of a horse mounting another horse? Park on Fremont might even be a good place to grab some drinks, but you should make sure you grab a bite to eat elsewhere."}

I wanted to order a girly drink like sangria but they don't make it, so I just ordered a burger + sweet tater tots and it wasn't that great.   Also trying to have some sort of conversation was impossible because the noise level of this joint is extremely loud to say the least. I did like the music and decor but the food + noise makes it a negative for me to actually enjoy hanging here.  Overall I'd say that POF is a great joint to hook up with a friend or 2 over drinks at the bar for about 20 minutes but that's it.... or maybe hang out at the bar for as long as it takes to find an interesting person to leave to another joint with.

We were met with some of the worst service I have ever experienced as a guest at any establishment.  We were seated outside on their patio just before noon. Our table was slightly sunny, which wasn't a problem for me in the beginning. Our server, Andrea, came over and we ordered a patio pounder which is an entire bottle of champagne and a craft of OJ for $20, my boyfriend also ordered a coffee. I was stoked. After a very short time the sun had moved, and left our table in direct sunlight. The both of us started to get very hot and uncomfortable. When our server came over to us again to drop off our drinks we explained our discomfort and asked to be moved to a shady table that had just opened up. She said yes, of course and happily moved us to the more comfortable table, and took our food orders. Not five minutes later the host came up, and plainly said you can't stay here, this table is being saved and when we expressed that we had just become too hot at our original one all she said in reply was oh and walked away.  The attitude we received was unnecessary. We had not moved tables on our own, we asked our server, who had no problem moving us. All we wanted was to sit at a table where we could comfortably enjoy our brunch. I do not think it was an outrageous request.   After (embarrassingly) moving back to our original sunny table, we received our food. I ordered French toast and my boyfriend got the breakfast skillet. Our food was GREAT. Let me repeat that: OUR FOOD WAS GREAT. This may have been some of the best French Toast I have ever had. But after we received our food our server Andrea was nowhere to be found. Throughout the rest of our meal she came to our table only twice. Once right after we received our food (obviously due to the two bite rule) and once more, in passing, to ask if my boyfriend needed more coffee, after we were almost finished with our meal. She did not even drop off our check herself. I would not have been so upset by this if I hadn't heard her chatting excitedly with the table next to us. We can only assume that her terrible attitude was due to her assuming she would not receive a tip from us after we were told (not asked... told) to move tables.  I do not know what exactly the staff here at Park on Fremont think customer service is. But it is definitely NOT treating your guests like they are an inconvenience or not worth your time and attention.  I will not be returning to Park on Fremont until I hear that the staff has had a makeover. The food was amazing, but not good enough to make me want to have a horrible experience like that ever again."}

I'm amazed they are still seating people at tables back here. Are these people crazy? I'm only here because I've placed my food order BCM (before crap music). That's right this is so bad, such a significant impact that we must start history over at year zero CM. We are in a new era of crap music. This Bloody Mary is cold comfort. I may need the bottle.

Salads, chicken salad sandwiches, that type of deal. The food is what you'd find at a pub.   I ordered steak tacos and they were okay. Nothing over the top. I paid $13 to have grapefruit juiced from the outside in and the vodka poured in. Silly me. The key lime pie was also disappointing. Grainy and it didn't have that tangy sour taste that gives you a pucker after you take a bite.  What I did like about this place was the decor and the bartenders. They were pretty cool, except one server pulled a crappy move when he came in and talked smack about a customer who ordered and old-fashioned and didn't know what type of bourbon he/she wanted them to make it with. Hey, you work there - how about YOU recommend something? Be nice. People can hear you.  Overall I'd go back for drinks - not in a grapefruit - and to check out the back patio, but wouldn't order food again."}

Chewing into the guts of the scorpion, realizing that its half-decayed organs were all over my teeth, and then washing it down with a shot of tequila was a 5-second NIGHTMARE. I almost threw up my entire lunch. So why did I do it? The server picked up on the gray glow of my meal disappointment and hit me with a brilliant up-sell. You know what you should try that's pretty good? she said with a wink, The Scorpion Shot! Come on, you have to do it, you're in Vegas! She smiled pointing to a black t-shirt they sold with '#GOTSTUNG' printed on it.  Awesome! was my innocent reply."}

It wasn't that busy of a night and it took over 20 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us and give us water.   I look over the happy hour menu and ask a few questions. Turns out the drinks for happy hour are NOT the same size as the regular counterparts in the menu. Same goes for the food choices.   The food was tasty, saving this experience. I had the Philly cheese steak and a friend had the sliders which were good as well. The drinks were tasty, but I don't know if they are 10 dollar craft cocktail tasty. After we were done eating , the waitress apologizes and gives us 2 of the 5$ special drinks for the trouble. Nice gesture, but the damage was done.

Then we get seated, and order our food. 2 Philly Mac & Cheese Sandwichs, and the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich. 1st the Philly,  size good and that was about it, meat was bland, mac and cheese had no cheese, tasted like bread crumbs, the bread was too hard and dry. Would not order again. 2nd the Waffle sandwich, very small, not worth the price. Then the chicken was like rubber, so we sent it back and didn't request a replacement. On a side not the tater tots were good, but not enough.  Then time for the check, they had the audacity to try and charge for Waffle Sandwich, when we sent it back.

One thing I will say is, there's a difference in having good service and then too much service, both times I felt like I had 6 people waiting on me, I constantly had people talking to me and felt I never had second to actually enjoy my food. Also, their whole delivery system for chips and salsa is terrible. They start by asking you which salsa I want as if I knew my options, so I ask for all at once so I can decide. Then they give you a basket of chips with these tiny little, smaller then a shotglass, cups of salsa. The chip barely fits in the cup. You kinda have to pick up the cup and pour the salsa on each individual chip. It's bananas. Has this nacho daddy character never been to a  Mexican restaurant? What is he trying to prove?

After 40 minutes I would expect some acknowledgement that the wait time was insane and maybe a comp'd serving of chips and salsa since they aren't supplied for free.   The Nacho Average Burger Nachos were tasty with melty nacho cheese, ground beef, thin crispy chips, bacon, red onion, lettuce and tomatoes. They let us know that the portion would be enough for 2 but because I love to eat, I finished it all on my own. They serve breakfast all day but my sister's breakfast burrito was sad. When you think breakfast burrito, you expect something massive. Hers was small, and filled mostly with eggs. She had to dig around for the bacon and they forgot the avocado that she added. It was a disappointing dish for her, but everyone else was pleased. I'm not sure if the 40 minute wait time was a one-off thing but I hope they adjust that soon."}

No, I want to get a seat and was told to wait to be seated by your sign. After asking to sit outside I was informed that only eating customers could sit outside, everyone else had to sit at the bar. Less that 30% of the outside tables were taken, and no one had food.   This place has amazing potential with a really cool drink list, fabulous vibe and what may or may not be yummy food. But their service is unfortunately subpar. Don't say I didn't warn you, but I suggest going elsewhere. Good drinks are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas.  Was contacted by customer service to let me know their policy recently changed and they are a restaurant first...so what does that mean? Your policy changed from what? Being friendly to discouraging customers? Allowing patrons not rating to sit outside? I'm so confused...and apparently so are your customers (I ate their the night of my post).

We sat and nursed our drinks for a couple hours without being rushed or hurried to clear the table even after business picked up around 10:30. I ordered a second drink and shortly after receiving it, asked our server if they could hold the table for five minutes so that we could hop into the back-backyard to smoke. She said that'd be fine so we went and played on the teeter totter (yes, the teeter totter) for a few minutes. When we returned my almost-full second drink as well as our other beverages had been completely cleared and the table was reset for new service. We continued to sit and chat while waiting for our check to come. Our server walked by a few times and hesitated, noticing our table was completely cleared. She didn't comment on this and went about her business, serving up many rounds of shots and drinks to a nearby table. Finally, upon receiving our check, we waited another 20 minutes before we could get her back to the table. I explained to her that I didn't get to enjoy my second drink as the table was cleared while we were out back. Without hesitation she apologized and had it removed from our bill. Though, I was happy with the location, atmosphere and drink selection, I was disappointed in the service.

My favorite healthy-ish thing on their menu is the steak salad - it's my regular lunch order, love it every time. Last time I was there, it was no longer on the menu. Strike two.  Finally, my favorite non-healthy thing on their menu is the garbage fries. Last time I was there, they were $18...?! I could swear they were always $10...maybe $12. But now $18?!

The interior is cute and quirky and a little hipster vibish?  It is a rectangular shaped building with the bar on the left side and booths on the right side to sit in.  There is an outdoor area that I would have liked to check out, but with the heat breaking temps on that May day in 2018 (I think it was 103 which was record breaking for that particular day) - we decided to sit inside. Which.... we found out very quickly was probably almost as bad as sitting outside.  To make a long story short - there was NO AIR CONDITIONING.  Now, if it is an old building and that is part of the charm ok ok I see.  However, there were also NO FANS.  It was devastatingly uncomfortable!  I am definitely torn on the review! I would have given 2 stars based solely on that.  If it was a total comfort atmosphere in the cooler months - it may have easily been a 4 star!  Because service was good.  Food was decent - the only real standout was the baked macaroni bites - wow Delicious!  They were a little spicy and I could not figure out what was making them that way.  I do not usually like spice, but these really were the perfect little bites.  Happy hour had good prices and variety of food.  I would definitely check this place out on a NOT HOT day.

It took awhile for that to be made then when they dropped that they took my food order.  The food didn't take too long since it was a salad. The Cobb salad was huge and delicious.  Ask me how many times the 2 two bartenders came to check on me? ZERO! Take tsk. The blonde bartender came by about 20 mins after I got my food to make sure I got it because she saw a salad sitting on the line. Really?

We asked the waitress (who now was a different waitress because they switched mid shift) for water. She of course didn't remember and when she came back to see how the food was we asked for it again.  We had empty glasses that weren't cleared and the waitress didn't even ask if we wanted more drinks.  We asked our first waitress to split our check into 3 before we even ordered so that at the end there would be no issue. Of course that information wasn't relayed to the new waitress and she brought us 1 check.

Our group works in show business here and would be coming after shows.  Whoever answered the phone a week ago said they would make a reservation for me to ensure staffing. I called to double check yesterday morning and there was no reservation, nor enough staff. After discussing this with Julie, my understanding was that they would be staffed, and would take care of our large group who loved this bar. Also discussed was that on their site it states open till 3am. We would definitely be there till at least 2. She stated they usually close at 1 on Tuesdays but if there was business they stay open. Great!  Nope. I arrived to last call at 12:20am, a bar of 30+ people (almost ALL) were our group and an obstinate and ridiculous manager stating no one was there at 11:30p like the reservation said ( not true as well) so they were going to close. CLOSE WITH A FULL BAR AND MORE COMING.  Unacceptable.  We left immediately, deciding to give our money and very loyal patronage to #donttellmama across the street.  Worst manager ever.

Tip- check in on Yelp to get a free house margarita. It's smaller than the one you'd get it you'd order it on your own, but c'mon, it's free.  We were sat at a table by the bar and our waiter began his magic. Taking drink orders. Convincing my friend to do that $20 scorpion shot, which she said she enjoyed. None for me, please and thank you. I got my free margarita and an Iced tea- the marg was amazing, the iced tea was not.  I ordered the triple dipper for the table. The guacamole was a little tough to dip into. The queso I thought was out of this world, and the salsa was alright. Spicy for being a ild salsa and we were able to get free refills of the chips because I think I ate an entire basket of myself.  Note- my advice after eating here is to get the nachos. Whatever kind. I'd see them pass by me and I'd think, dammit, I should have ordered that! Every freaking time. There wasn't one that looked bad, so that was my error.  I actually got their seafood enchilada combo. The refried beans to me were too runny. The rice was dry and the enchiladas had no real flavor to them. I took a few bites and smooshed everything around to make it seem like I ate more than I did. I didn't want to be one of those, please return this and order me something else, please people. So I ate what I could before my stomach revolted agains me and called it again.  I'd give this place another chance, but I know now what to order and what to stay clear of. With name like, nacho daddy there shouldn't be anything else on the menu BUT nachos. Live and learn, Andy.

When we arrived, we were glibly told that there was no more food being served. So we opted just for drinks. My girlfriend ordered a Long Island iced tea and I a Manhattan. Both were served completely wrong. First, the Long Island was served in a cheap plastic cup, and was made completely wrong. It tasted more like lemonade than anything else. We weren't even sure it was the right drink. My Manhattan came in a tiny rocks glass and was actually served on the rocks. There's no way if it was properly made to portion, that it would have even fit in that tiny glass (with the improperly added ice). It tasted like barely more than a Bourbon on the rocks. The bartender had no clue what he was making or how to make them. And for paying $24 for the two drinks, they should have been made right. Not to mention that if you walk down the street to Atomic Liquors, you'll get the best Manhattans made in all of downtown. Beyond all of this, we were part of a group who had called ahead and told them we would have 30-60 people coming. And at $12 a drink, that's a lot of money. However, the management treated us all like crap and decided to make it last call at around 10 minutes to Midnight. Really? On Fremont street in Las Vegas? What, does the staff have school in the morning? Save your time, your money, and the pain and just go to a better bar.

In that time, they seated 7 parties of 2 and 3 that came in after us. They kept assuring us that they simply needed a table large enough for us (and they couldn't possibly put two smaller tables together, for unknown reasons).  After waiting for 45 minutes for a table, two tables opened up at the same time. One was a 6 top, one was a 4 top. They tried to seat the 5 of us at the 4 top. (Side note, their 4 tops are NOT large by any means). Now, at least 2 of the other parties that came in AFTER us and were seated BEFORE us were seated at other 4 tops.   At this point we politely said no, we wanted the 6 top so we could sit comfortably. They went the consult the owner (I'm assuming she was the owner, she was a female with short curly hair who wasn't wearing the standard black uniform). The owner then rolled her eyes and, said, Yeah, well I want a million dollars. She didn't realize our party was standing directly behind her and to the left, so we were able to hear the conversation very clearly.  Isn't that lovely? After making us wait 45 minutes, we are being unreasonable by asking for a table that will actually seat all of us, when there is one available right there. They did eventually, reluctantly, seat us at the 6 top.  Pity, several members of our party were actually big fans of this place, but you can't come back from such terrible customer service. The biggest problem, honestly, was the fact that they tried to seat us at the 4 top after a 45 minute wait with an open 6 top right next to us. Several of our party has worked in food service and we understand waits taking longer sometimes due to parties sitting around chatting. But treating us like we're being demanding for wanting space to sit AFTER such a wait is unacceptable. The owner's comment was the final nail in the coffin to assure we never return.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Ok for us... service was decent, but for some reason wasn't wow'ed by the food.  Came here based on Yelp reviews for brunch with my boyfriend on a Saturday late morning; we were purposefully looking for spots that were NOT on the Strip so we chose this non touristy place in the downtown area.  Venue / Service: slightly on the dark side when we came in, with grey wood and wrought iron decor.  Luckily we had a bit of sunlight by sitting near the window.  Vibe of a down to earth, homey brunch spot and thank goodness it was a much quieter affair than you would find on the Las Vegas Strip.  Servers were in general very friendly, always checking on the waters and trying to reassure us that our food was coming out.    Food: I prefer lighter affairs so perhaps I'm biased against most brunch spots.  Even so, I felt like everything here tended to be a bit on the heavier side, but perhaps we ordered the wrong items.  -- Eggs benedict (spinach, tomato, bacon, chive potatoes)($13) - well balanced dish; this was the favorite between the two dishes.  Eggs were perfectly cooked and yolky.  What saved this dish was 1) the acidity from the grilled tomatoes and 2) the kick you got from the hollandaise sauce.  I usually hate things that have heat to it, but you needed the spiciness a bit to lighten up the dish (especially since there was a huge dollop of the sauce over the eggs; would have preferred less of that).  Potatoes were... potatoes... I didn't need them.    -- Truffled egg sandwich (scrambled eggs, mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon on ciabatta with chive potatoes)($12) - recommended by the waiter but unfortunately we were disappointed.  Mushrooms and chives were great in terms of adding earthy flavors, but the eggs were slightly overcooked and overall, the dish felt really heavy.  There was too little feta to help with that and also a lot of bread.  We both kept wishing it had some sort of acidity / more herbs in it to brighten up the dish; my date struggled to finish it without feeling heavy in the stomach.  Overall, probably not the best brunch we had.  However, if you are looking for a nice, quieter spot in DT Las Vegas, this can be a spot to consider (just perhaps don't go for that sandwich)."}

They are extremely sweet, so sweet that I could not even finish one taco. I only ate the tops which were fresh coleslaw and guacamole. The jackfruit was drenched in bbq sauce and it was not a good mix. The tortilla did not taste good and seemed cold, like they didn't heat up the tortilla all the way.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Overrated. I've read several reviews that said the pictures of the food look amazing, but the taste itself is mediocre. We came on a Friday afternoon for brunch. The breakfast menu is stopped after 11am. There was a short wait, but they sat us pretty fast. There is only street parking available. The service was not great. Our server came up to our table to take our order but he wasn't even looking at us while we were ordering. He called out a friends name in the middle of my order and continued to not make eye contact with our table while scribbling on his pad.   My table ordered the fried deviled eggs (only thing I would recommend), shrimp & grits, corn hash, grilled cheese & tomato soup, and the truffle egg sandwich.   Shrimp & grits: coming from the south, I've had my share of shrimp and grits and this one was just horrible. The grits had no seasoning what so ever and the sauce that came on top has no flavor at all. I don't eat my food salty and I actually enjoy grits just plain, but this dish was just horrible. I was tempted to send it back to the kitchen, but since we were there with guest I just poured hot sauce on it...   Grilled cheese and tomato soup: gigantic piece of toast with some cheese on it and watered down tomato soup. Pass.   I can't rate the other dishes. I love variety so I always taste the other dishes at the table, but I wasn't even tempted to get a taste of anyone else's dish.   Verdict: don't be fooled by the thousands of reviews and check-ins."}

I saw the new menu and was salivating over a shrimp po boy so I went.  I must say this was my most disappointing visit yet.  Where to begin. 1) The caesar salad was overly fishy tasting and my wife coouldn't even finish it.  2) The Shrimp Po Boy was extremely messy and difficult to eat without everything spilling off the ciabatta.  The shrimp were overcooked and tough. 3) The beignette's were more like grease balls.  I still like this place but I think I am going to stick to breakfast which seems to be much more consistent and worthy of top marks."}

Ordered strawberry lemonade. Disappointed there were not refills on the lemonade. They put too much ice in the glass for no refills. It was like three sips of lemonade. And she didn't tell me when I ordered that there were no refills. Had to keep asking server for straws. (She brought me water after I found out no more lemonade) Also ordered to eat ...the pancakes with the sausage on top and the deep-fried deviled eggs. The deep-fried deviled eggs were insanely delicious. :) Loved the kick of flavor and loved the concept of deep fry and deviled eggs. I wished there was more than four eggs. I wanted to eat a whole dozen eggs like that. LOL. The pancakes were dry and tasted like baking soda. We asked for more syrup which was a little jars and were not told that they were $1 each. The whole experience was good. Just put some sugar in the pancake mix and don't charge for extra syrup."}

The eggs Benedict was only slightly better because the Hollandaise sauce was interesting. So ... never again."}

I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was okay. The portion was gigantic, but for taste I would give it a 2.5/5 because the grilled cheese was very oily and greasy and the tomato soup was sour. I added some cream to it and it was a whole lot better.   During my experience there, the service was not the best. The waiters/ waitresses seemed inexperienced and were not communicating well with us. When we came in to get seated, the hostess led us half way and we were confused on which table to sit at until I asked her and she was like, Oh, yeah. This is your table. Then the waiter came  and I asked for water and he just put up 2 fingers instead of asking if I wanted two waters for my mom. Throughout our meal, he had the attitude of I'm so done with working. Later he went to the other waiters to talk and mingle and completely forgot about us but one of the younger waiters came to us and got us our check and to go boxes (only nice thing about our experienced).   Not sure if I would come back."}

The place is charming and full of bright colors and is casual, making you feel hip for eating/venturing to a vegan joint. No animals were harmed for your meal. Unfortunately, your taste buds would be.  Appetizer: Tamales and the Vegan sushi. Tamales were mostly cornhusk with a small amount of filling. The filling was delicious, just not plentiful. Sushi was flavorful and colorful. This dish was pretty to look at and hit on all the sushi accent flavors. Awesome original flavors encountered; I was thinking we're in for a treat, but mostly everything fell flat after this round.  Round 2: Mushroom Pizza and butternut squash ravioli. The mushroom madness pizza tasted like a Diaya frozen pizza. I've had much, much better vegan pizza in downtown (Pop Up Pizza) and it's nicer on the wallet. The squash ravioli. What the fuck was that? Sauce was runny and flavorless. And the server recommend this!   Anyway, being a complete fatty on my cheat day, we ordered and split a blueberry cheesecake. This was pretty tasty. Not the greatest I've had, but it was pleasant and fresh and unique.  Vegenation is a place I really, really want to like. I will be back, as some items looked and smelled heavenly. I also wish they didn't have so many pasta and bread options. Processed foods are still processed foods, even if they are being served up in a cutely decorated joint in the burgeoning hipster Mecca that is Downtown Las Vegas."}

We ordered the cinnamon biscuits and he brought them out first as an appetizer even though we would've much rather had them after our meal, he should've at least asked. Menu is so limited, and I know that it's supposed to be a sort of minimalistic style type deal, but they close at 2 or 3 AND their menu doesn't give much range. I wish they would give us something to work with. Maybe if the service wasn't so bad I wouldn't mind it as much, but the food wasn't all that great either.

When did Nevada become crunchy granola? I mean, I am sure it took place without anyone asking my opinion and that's fine, I get it. Hippy is cool in a not so cool kinda way. It's like hipsters and their man buns. It's not cool, from the perspective of grown up male adults. But, maybe they place their hair in the bun because that one drunk chick at the club who was kinda sorta cute said oh. M. gee!   Like this:  My folks are a product of the 50's and were knee deep in the REAL hippy movement out here in SF. If you told my Dad that the hippy culture was cool and that people selectively chose to become hippies and refused to wash their hair n clothes n stuff and they were attempting to recreate 1960's Berkeley, he'd respond with a simple, monotone voice of Why would anyone want to do that?  That out of the way, the crunchiness at this spot is not for me. I live in an area of the country where the crunch in crunchy was created and I shop at Berkeley Bowl every now and then, so there!!!  Coffee was really good and really fresh. Locally roasted and I am a huge fan of local coffee. On account of the evil mermaid movement and all.   Food was ok. Not amazing not send it back terrible just flat out ok.   Truffled egg sandwich had a few bites of delicious and a few more bites of bland. It was odd cause with each delicious bite, I expected the next bite to follow suit. Inconsistent cooking on that order I guess.   Pancakes were dark, in a good way and pretty solid. They serve a tiny jar of fresh maple syrup with it. Nice touch.   Expensive, as expected in Vegas but we just ate at Mon Ami Gabi the day before and we chowed there. Chowed as in ordered enough food for 3, but it was just the two of us. This spot shouldn't be in the same price range as that spot, but it is and I'm not intrigued nor interested in that.

When it was time for us to be seated, the helpful greeter inside called my name loud and clear both inside (I heard it, even though we were outside) and then they came outside too! Great service for this part.  We were seated quickly and someone came to take drink orders right away. Coffee here was average, but there were other options like lemonade and many teas in the selection.  The menu is pretty standard food for a brunch spot. I ordered the corned beef hash, but it came as meat cubes, not hash. The poached eggs were average and presentation here is clearly not important. While the food tasted OK, it was not outstanding or memorable. There's no reason to wait in line for this.  Service was prompt, but I was surprised that nobody offered water for our table. Just bring water - it's the most basic thing humans need after air. Bring it, or at least offer it.   Overall this place feels rushed and driven by turnover. It's clean and the food is OK. The servers are friendly, but they are moving fast and that is their main focus."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I have tried very hard to be open minded and give this place a chance, and I am a five year very simple vegan.   This place is all smoke and mirrors.  I can't fathom anyone would give it more than one star. This was my 4th visit to the restaurant.  It's beyond bright, it's like walking out of a club at 7 am.  It's as if no one is conscientious of setting a restaurant's ambiance.  Is this a cafe or dinner place?  They had half way cleaned tables, like they halfway clean a table and then their ADD kicks in and they walk away and don't finish.  I was fighting my gut to walk out because I had a companion that wanted to try it.  It looked terrible.  The waiter leans into the table like he's tired, to get the order which I find highly inappropriate.  We ask for water and a coffee.  The waiter carries two large glasses in one hand because God forbid this place buys trays and makes the waiters use them.  Like I want this guy's hands all over my drinks.  You're in the food business.  This isn't your living room.  He brings the French press coffee pot to the table but he has yet to bring the coffee mug or cream.  Then he brings the mug. Then he asks what type of cream my friend wanted.  The coffee alone takes three trips of the waiter.  He should have asked all this before bringing the coffee. Don't bring food and drinks that I can't touch yet because you haven't also brought the items I need to enjoy them.  I wanted to try the coffee so we called a busboy over and asked him to please bring a mug which was two feet away.  This guy is such a people pleasing nervous wreck that he brings an empty teapot and a mug over and is fumbling with it trying to put it down.  He is holding the mug in his hand and making nonsense chatter that I am afraid to ask him for anything else.  We told him we didn't ask for the teapot we only needed the mug. Then he shakes his head no, like he's bowing and takes the mug with him and leaves the pot.  We have to tell him a 3rd time to leave the mug.  Then the coffee wasn't even hot.  We had the sushi, sliders, and veggie burger.  He brought the sushi first, which was my entree.  But in usual fashion of the untrained staff, he did not bring the chopsticks, so we have to wait and stare at the food.   Does the kid think that I wish to eat separately from my companion??? I told him it was my entree but he has no idea how to serve people dinner.  The the sliders came, which once were good but tonight weren't even cooked inside and they lacked enough aioli as a previous time I had them.  Then this thing came. This pink mush paste on a pita type bread.  That's a burger????? It was God awful.  We asked what it was made of which I don't recall but it's not a burger in any way shape for form. It's pink paste. I don't think it's cooked.  I'm trying to come up with a texture that it's like but I can't think of any food like it.  Our plates were raging hot from sitting under the heat lamps but the food was cold.  The ketchup, that's another fascinating aspect....it's homemade, and allegedly has curry and other spices, but tonight it was cold tomato paste.  It doesn't have a ketchup texture.  We sent the burger back and opted for the Italian sub, which was actually good, but not good enough that I will ever go here again.  Then we have this mess on our table of empty plates and this busboy guy comes over (finally) then makes this big hand gesture asking if he can take our plates as if we would say no, we say yes, and he replies, are you sure?  Yes we're sure we don't want our empty dirty plates and napkins anymore!  The entire place is disturbing."}

I went with the Huevos Motulenos which I honestly didn't like--I'm not sure why so many people are nuts over this dish. I feel like the salsa just doesn't go well in a main course. It was an interesting concoction of food items I've never really had together but I wish I had gotten something else. I wanted to try the Truffled Egg Sandwich but they only serve it Monday through Friday. Their pancakes are huge.  I want to give this place 4 stars, but I can't because were somewhat duped into buying an appetizer. So, you know how lots of restaurants give you free bread before your meal? Our waitress asked us, after serving us water, would you like some biscuits? Well, to us this sounded like pre-meal free bread so we said yes. What she really meant to say is, would you like to start with an appetizer called the 'cinnamon biscuits, warm strawberry compote'? The money wasn't the issue, but the trickery into ordering more on the menu. She might as well have started by saying, would you like to start with the Dom Perignon?  The staff was very nice/efficient. I recommend checking this joint out if you want some breakfast off the strip. Is it worth taking a taxi here? No. I really only went because I had my car. Albeit, this is a decent breakfast eatery."}

It doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's in a sketchy neighborhood, but inside it's filled to capacity with downtown hipsters. Seating was quite limited so I opted to sit at the lunch counter. Not a great choice because I spent my whole lunch impeding the flow of waitresses and listening to the expediter shout orders. I kept thinking I should lend a hand and plate some food or deep fry something.  The food itself is good. I had the roast beef sandwich, potato salad and iced tea. The quality of the ingredients was above average, and they seem to take care with presentation and little added touches. But the price was what stopped me dead in my tracks. $16.50 plus tip for a sandwich, side and a drink. Ouch! I hadn't planned on spending $20 on lunch, and if I had, I would have gone someplace better.   I gave them a fair try, but unless I get a raise or someone else is buying, I won't be back.

I was more hungry after eating it than before. We brought up the lack of substance to an employee, and was told we should have chosen another menu item. Well, thank you for that information.  Service was seriously lacking on attention. Water was served without straws, had to flag down a waiter to get them. Nobody refilled our glasses after we emptied them 5 minutes into the meal. Nobody paid attention, nobody in sight.  Again, the food tasted real good, but there are so many options in LV to get a solid, well crafted salad with plenty of substance in the $12 - $15 range, and receiving attentive service, so I don't see why we would return.

On a Saturday morning I get a text from my friend who says he just flew in and the people he was supposed to hang out with on the Strip are all hungover and sleeping still, so my husband and I swoop him up from his hotel and suggest eat. since we wanted to show him the downtown area. The location itself is very unique and just walking distance from Container Parker. Being from SF/Bay Area, we're all used to extremely long waits for brunches, so eat.'s 20 minute wait was no big deal. Once we finally got seated, the 3 of us ended up in a 2-top that was in a corner. It was very.. cozy, but what's a little bit of discomfort among friends? The hostess was very sweet and wanted to make sure we didn't wait too long, so I appreciated that. We ordered the corned beef, eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and pancakes for the table. The pancakes were mouth-watering, and probably the best part of the meal, but one of the servers did give me grief about asking for more syrup (I swear the dinky little serving they give isn't enough!) My friend ate all of his corned beef, so he had no complaints; however, my husband hated his chicken fried steak with a passion. It was very tough - just looking at it you could tell it was completely dry and devoid of flavor. He left a large chunk of it uneaten and didn't bother taking it home. Since we didn't have that much room on the table, I wasn't really feeling my eggs benedict, so I placed it behind me in the booth and stuck to my pancakes. As other people have experienced, waiters are somewhat hard to track down. Someone who wasn't our waiter asked me if I was done with my benedict plate and if he could take it away. It was barely touched, so I'm surprised he didn't ask what was wrong and didn't ask if I wanted to take it to go (my husband eventually ate it at home to make up for his lack of a meal). Maybe we should have ordered a few different items like the truffled egg sandwich, but my husband probably would never want to come back here. I came here wishing that we had spent our morning eating at Mr. Mama's since I haven't been there yet. Hopefully that place doesn't disappoint. Eat. does look like they have a pretty big and devoted following, so I hope they continue to do better and improve on the shortcomings guests have pointed out as of late."}

Passion tea was fragrant and unsweetened. Truffle egg sandwich was okay. Eggs were fluffy. Some of the potatoes and onion slices were nice and brown. Griled cheese was big (thick bread). the tomato soup reminded me of the tomato sauce on pizza.  Nothing to write home about. Tried it, not worth coming back for.   Service was decent. Had to pay for street parking ($1/hr), then we walked to the Container Park."}

It was fresh, but it was literally a bowl of greens with a red pepper, a few slices of cukes and a radish; no cracker, no grain, no nuts. Powerhouse? I guess i don't quite get it. It was at least... fresh? Problem is I told the waitress when she asked how it was. She never offered me a cracker or the menu to order one. We also had the dumplings. They were good too; yet five to share doesn't fill one up at all. My advise: Read the menu and ask questions like: what does it has in it. BTW My tacos I made at home filled me up. Just frustrated that I had to cook and wash dishes."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I went here for my birthday this year and was mostly disappointed.  The main issue was service.  We came in for brunch (10:30ish) and waited for roughly 15 minutes before our waiter came over to take our drink order.  During this time other wait staff glanced in our direction, but didn't take the initiative to assist.  When the waiter finally came, I felt like we were inconveniencing him.  He didn't really speak to us, it was more like a drive through: Drinks?, Eat?, That it?.    In regard to food, it was okay.  I had chilaquiles (being from New Mexico) and was disappointed that the red chile was overpowering the green.  The sausage was also fairly bland."}

The ambiance is hip yet casual and the waitresses look like typical hipster vegans with their multi-colored hair and septum piercings.  I quite like their living plant wall and plants hanging over the tables.   .  $42.62 got us some spaghetti and meatballs for the boy, an orange smoothie, a greek salad, a dumpling appetizer, and a quesadilla.   . $6.00 Orange burst smoothie- Consists of orange, carrot, ginger, turmeric, and pineapple. It is served in a cute mason jar which is appropriate because it tastes just like a scented candle.   . Sadly they were all out of the save the tuna vegan sushi so we had to settle for the My Little Dumpling appetizer for $6.95. The steamed shiitake & spinach dumplings were served in an adorable bamboo steamer basket.  I very much enjoyed these.  They are served with chopsticks and a tasty soy-based dipping sauce.  . $10.95 Muchas Gracias- Organic sweet potato quesadilla with black beans and chipotle crema.  Husband quite enjoyed this.  It was served very hot and fresh.   . $10.95 Greek salad- Has feta, kale, romaine, red peppers, green peppers, onions, vinagrette, olives, and oddly enough- tortilla chips.  I found the tortilla chips to be out of place in a greek salad but I enjoyed the vegan feta cheese more than I thought I would.   . $7.00 Chocolate tacos- Delicate crunchy pastry shell with chocolate goop, chopped strawberries, coconut, more mystery goop on top, and HUGE PIECES OF ROCK SALT...like the kind you use to make ice cream! I liked everything but the ginormous hunks of salt, which, according to our waitress and the chef, are supposed to be in there.  I sincerely hope nobody loses a tooth eating one of these.  The waitress was nice enough to take it off our bill.   . That's alright because I didn't have mushroom in my tummy for dessert anyways.  I should also mention that they wanted us to wait 20 minutes and we had to ask if they'd 'lettuce' sit on the terrace.  They did not 'carrot' all that we had no utensils or napkins the entire time we were there.  Overall I'm glad to have 'bean' there but 'olive' myself and my wallet too much to go back.  Peas!"}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "First off, the food was FABULOUS. Then reason why I give this place 2 stars is because of the service/staff. Every point of contact from the hostess, to our server, and the food runner were rude, short, and had very bad attitudes. The hostess gave us a hard time about seating us when our table had already been set up with high chair and everything, but wanted to wait till the rest of the party showed up; which, understandable but you already set up the table. It seemed as though the service staff were so overwhelmed with the busyness that they were frustrated and were taking it out on us. After we told the hostess the rest of our party was parking, she made a snide remark that we need to order before they closed (and they closed in 2 hours). The food runner had dropped our food at the wrong seats so while we switched them she sighed and rolled her eyes. Our waiter dropped off our check before we were even finished eating our entrees without even asking for it. We then wanted to order more coffees and desserts after our meal, but didn't seem to have the option to because we felt rushed and pushed out. It's such a shame because all the food was absolutely amazing."}

Their breakfast is pretty delicious, they have the biggest slices of bread that I have ever seen and their pancakes are ridiculously good!   I also fantasize about their cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote.  The few things that I don't like, is that we have never had a friendly waiter/waitress. For some reason, the 4 times I have been there, the waitstaff always acts like they are doing us a favor by helping us and they try to suggestively sell you sides of everything or bigger sizes of whatever you ordered, I understand the concept but it gets pretty annoying when you are trying to place an order on a table of 6 and 2 to 3 extra things are suggested to every person.   I also have to warn you that their veggie burger is terrible! So the next time I went I ordered another dish without the bacon and the waitress said we are too busy right now to make any substitutions uhmm I wasn't making a substitution, I just said no bacon.... Anyway!   Eat is actually worth a try because everything is made from scratch and their food is high quality, I just wish the staff was friendly."}

We sat at the table for quite some time before the server showed up.  Then he asks if we have any questions about the menu but then fails to mention that they changed it and some items are not made any more.   Oops!  This would be fine if it didn't happen a second time for dessert!   If they were really concerned about it the hostess and the 2 servers standing there talking at the host stand could have scratched out the items they don't serve anymore (which was done to the amended dessert menu we received.

I ordered the chicken friend steak and asked for the gravy on the side, but when it arrived, my food was covered in gravy.  Before I could ask for a change, the server who brought the food already rushed off.  I relented and ate my food as it came, but was pleasantly surprised.  I normally don't like too much gravy on my food, but the gravy was delicious.  My party also ordered the beignets for the table.  The other reviews on beignets were mixed, so we wanted to try them out for ourselves.  As most reviewers noted, the beignets were dense and not flaky and light like they're suppose to be.  That being said, they still tasted pretty good.  I intend to come back because although it was just an average visit, I see the potential of this place turning into a great local spot.  I think that the staff have to be more friendly and attentive, but otherwise, this is a place that I would still recommend."}

Then they brought the appetizer but we didn't have anything to eat it with, so we had to flag someone down for silverware and plates.  Also, no alcohol, but it is on the menu.  We tried the one downtown, again great food, but the service was terrible. Pinot Grigio on the menu, but they don't have it. Had to flag down people to even stop to get extra napkins.   We asked to see desert menu but we were given the check.  We got the message.  If you go, expect great food, but poor service and you won't be disappointed."}

We were told we would not be seated until the whole group was present. We countered with the logical point that our friend was literally two minutes away. Still, we would not be seated because we can serve people in less than 20 minutes. Not sure what that had to do with it. We could have easily sat down and ordered his coffee within that two minutes. Oh well, gotta love rule followers.   Anyway slightly annoyed we eventually sat down and started with OJ and coffee. Our server was awesome. She had a great attitude and was fun.   The cinnamon biscuits were crazy hyped as the thing to get so we got 2 orders. Yea, not sure what that was all about. Dry, bland. Sure yea it's awesome I guess, when you sprinkle cinnamon on biscuits and call it a craze? Fail.  Most of us are huge fans of deviled eggs so we ordered those as well. 5 star presentation but 1 star taste. Again, bland. Was hoping for some horseradish taste or seasoning. Just tasted like a deep fried egg which was a unique twist on the item but lacked flavor.  I ordered the eggs benedict which happened to be a special. I love eggs benedict and order them any time I can. I took two bites and pushed the plate back. The hollandaise sauce was bland and the turkey bacon or whatever it was tasted like cardboard. Again, horrible absence of flavor. Hollandaise should catch a slight lemon flavor and bacon of any kind should be exploding with flavor.   Our server graciously took it off the check but that didn't help my breakfast hunger any.   So, yea, sorry. Don't get the hype. Won't be back."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "This place came highly recommended by local foodie friends.  Cute place.  Service was great, portions were more than generous, food did not come close to meeting expectations. 1) Golden Brown Pancakes and chicken sausage - cakes were definitely golden brown.  They were moist but VERY dense, resembling a true cake like texture... imagine eating a 6 inch cake stacked 4 inches high!  Plate was served with one chicken sausage which seemed to be more of a garnish in comparison to the large portion of cakes.  Ended up ordering a side of bacon which was thick and tasty.  The bacon side was generous (5 slices)!!! 2) Huevos Motulenos - Very interesting combo of flavors especially with the bananas in such a savory dish.  Did we regret ordering, no.  Would we order again, no. 3) Green chicken chili posole - awesome flavor, pleasant amount of lime notes, it was served a little above room temp.  Not hot, just warm. 4) grilled cheese and chips - 7 year old was pleased but only able to eat 1/4 of the sandwich (would've been great if they had a Childrens menu or smaller portions available).  Chips were homemade and DELISH.  5) veggie burger and kick ass tomato soup - veggie patty lacked flavor and consistency was unpalatable, almost slimy.  I enjoyed gutting the burger, eating the alfalfa, tomatoes and Avos as a small salad on its own.  As a veggie foodie, I would not recommend.  Tomato soup did not kick my ass.  Flavor was okay, but the generously thick Parm shavings were unable to melt due to the again, tepid temp of the soup and possibly that the shavings were too chunky.  Still had a mild acidic tomato flavor (which I love)... just cold.  The bread is thick and well grilled... if you love bread, they've got a lot.  If you don't, maybe explore the anti-which options.  Coffee stayed hot and filled to the brim. Again, service was great... although no one noticed that my entire veggie patty and bread sat on my plate as a deconstructed mess.  I was never afforded the opportunity to voice my dissatisfaction, would I have complained and sent it back? No but I would have definitely given my opinion.  I think it's a nice addition when servers ask about your experience and quality of food.  Otherwise you rely on yelp for constructive criticism/opinions.  Cute place, although off the beaten path.  Solid base, but room for improvement."}

So I came here with my wife and good friend to have some breakfast months ago and going there i realized pulling up that i had to pay for parking. I think all restaurants should have a designated area to park or offer free parking with a punch card kind of like going to a casino and having validated parking.  Lets get to the meal we ordered alot of things. My wife had the Shrimp n Grits (4/5 stars) I had my usual Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs which didn't really wow me so (3/5) Also Ordered Grilled Cheese and A Order Of pancakes Both (3/5).  Nothing here is really memorable besides the shrimp and grits so i definitely recommend it. Other than that service is solid and i know this place will do just fine because people love to come eat breakfast. And as long as they keep their ingredients fresh which they do they will be a popular eatery for a long time.   Thanks for a solid meal.

Both visits we decided to do take out because we just wanted to relax in our hotel (it was literally less than a mile from where we were staying)  My first visit I ordered the bao buns and the chicken pot pie gnocchi. They were both fairly delicious! I didn't get to finish my gnocchi tho because my hotel room didn't have a refrigerator :( lol   My second visit was a let down. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings, the hot tamales, and the Daniel Negreanu. My partner ordered the spicy picante pineapple pizza and the east west tacos.  The cauliflower wings weren't bad but the hot tamale was a super disappointment tho considering how they were voted the best in Las Vegas. They were extremely dry and had very little filling.  The Daniel Negreanu (which is meatball sub) wasn't bad but the fries were stale and they only gave me like three fries? Lol so I guess if you order something to go make sure it doesn't come with fries  My partner's spicy picante pizza was good! Only complaint was that it was pretty small even for a personal size pizza. The east west tacos however weren't good. The sauce was extremely sweet and the tortillas were breaking apart when we tried to eat them :/   All in all, it isn't a bad place. It has a nice atmosphere and the staff is so friendly!

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "OK. So the food is AMAZING! Let me just start off by saying that because the mission of this review is not to bash the restaurant.   I need the customers, owners and employees to realize how inappropriate DONALD was on the phone with me today.  My boyfriend and I are vegan/vegetarian. It's HARD to come to Vegas regularly for long days of strategic work and find healthy food to fuel our brains. This has been our FAVORITE place in LV. We even got to chat with the owners last month for a second to express our gratitude when they had the guest pop up chef from LA. Excitement grew as we learned they are on GrubHub although issues struck when I found that GrubHub would not deliver far enough in the span of a block. They will deliver to 4365 but not to 4500 on the street so I decided to call to see if something could work. I get a lovely lady named AARON (sorry if I misspelled your name lovely!) and she sent me to PostMates because they normally deliver as far as you want so I tried that but still no luck. I called back trying to see if I can figure something out. You all know that moment when your heart becomes set on having such delicious food. I ask for her because she was SUPER HELPFUL, KIND, and COMPASSIONATE ABOUT PROVIDING A GREAT EXPERIENCE. She said it was weird that they weren't showing up. So then she says Ok, try one more called EatStreet. If that doesn't work call back. At this moment, after the call, I turn to my boyfriend and go OMG I love the vegan/vegetarian culture because people are so genuinely nice and they want to help you! They know how important it is to eat well. My heart filled with love just because of her kindness I get back on my computer and try EatStreet. Unfortunately, EatStreet also said delivery unavailable. Now keep in mind I had just put down 50 MINUTES OF MY TIME to figure out how to order this food. I even offered to pay more to get it. We also discussed having GrubHub drop it off at the strip club down the street.   So I call back and ask for Aaron again and the host said hold on...  Hello this is DONALD, an agitated, grumpy voice came on the phone. I try to tell him my situation but I can barely get through it by the time his negative energy cuts me off and says We are in downtown and only deliver so far. I told him I understand that but I was working with Aaron to see if we couldn't figure something out. I told him she directed me to EatStreet but if I still had problems call back. No joke he says Try EatStreet. I repeat myself. I'm a little frustrated with his attitude but my voice was still calm and nice trying to work with him. Again he was soggy and said The Orleans is too far, the delivery companies only go a certain radius.  I was also literally OK with jumping in a taxi and meeting GrubHub down the street. Aaron may not have even been able to condone that but she was sincerely trying to help and her help wasn't taking her off the floor for more than a minute each time I called. (Now I have also worked at many restaurants from serving to bartending in downtown San Francisco and San Diego. I know a minute does effect flow but there are lovely other options on how to deal with inquisitive customers like myself.)  I could feel his negative energy through the phone and I choose not to deal with toxic energy. I ask for Aaron because she knows what's up. DONALD replies to me as if I'm one of his employees (obviously the manager) trying to distract him from a rush, Aaron can't come to the phone, she's on the floor right now. It's lunch time. It's busy! In my head I'm like, duh, why else would I be trying to order food from you... It's close to lunch. I told him he was providing poor customer service and he hung up on me....HE HUNG UP ON ME. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!! No Could you please try calling back later?, no I'm sorry miss I don't know what else we can do for you., No suggestions to another restaurant or hey even try another vegetarian search around your area with the GPS on. There were SO many other ways he could have dealt with this situation. DONALD WAS NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT KIND. I wouldn't have been mad or anything if he or Aaron couldn't help me as long as they were kind about it!   Needless to say when we go to VegeNation this week I hope Aaron is working so I can express how much gratitude I have for people like her. I hope she knows her light shines through his darkness. I hope all the employees can block out the negativity as well. I know what it's like to have a blood-sucking boss. I hope eventually the owners of VegeNation will take a step toward bettering their workplace environment by finding a replacement for DONALD. He needs to work at a restaurant that supports his negative attitude rather than working at a restaurant in which part of their values are to Do good by people.   P.S. Congrats Donald..This is the most time I've ever spent writing a review!  Eek! Methinks not about Donald!!"}

I have been twice, and both times there was wait. It didn't take more than 15 minutes for us to be seated. The real wait takes place after you're seated. There seems to be a good amount of servers floating around, but the service isn't all that great.  The first time I went, we had the berry biscuits as an appetizer and I order the chilaquiles. The berry biscuits are great. The biscuits are a tad bit dense, but the compote is divine. The chilaquiles were awful. Besides the chips and eggs, the dish was far from what I was expecting. There was some sort of mango concoction that was not appealing to my palate. Just awful!  My next time around I order the pancakes. If you want good plain pancakes, look no further. The pancakes are fluffy and well-seasoned - can you say a pancake is well-seasoned? Anyway, these bad boys don't even need syrup! I also got a side of cheese grits as recommended by the waiter. They were disgusting. Not enough cheese and the were extremely clumpy. They reminded me of instant cream of wheat.  Overall, I do like Eat. I will be back to try other things."}

Secondly, the staff need to smile more and be happy to be there. The wait staff both male and female behaved as if they had somewhere more important to be and were not timely in the needs of the table AT ALL. No utensils, we grabbed our own. Most importantly, kitchen staff should listen to wait staff; after all, the wait staff are your eyes and ears. Never seen a Chef so arrogant, that he argued with the waitress- as if she would make up the food being cold. Come see us at the table next time... a simple apology from the Chef, himself, would have been nice. The waitress was very kind; however, because I work in the service industry; note to ladies: when there is a couple sitting at the table, your back should NEVER face the woman and if there are two EMPTY CUPS, they both should be filled, not just his!!! The place has great potential. Food is about the experience and your staff represents the experience. They can enhance it or TANK IT!

As soon as we walked in, we were worried about a long wait time due to the fact that there were SO many people eating and also people waiting to be seated. But as soon as we walked in, we were seated right then and there, which was convenient. I assume it was because we were a party of two.

Not alot of healthier options in my opinion. And the bread that they add onto your plate... HUGE... Huge slices of sourdough bread, and 3-5 slices on your plate! I could hardly finish my bread, while my boyfriend didn't even touch his.   The food portions are quite large, much more than we expected when we ordered. Had I known that, I wouldn't have ordered the cinnamon toast strawberry dessert, because even though we shared it, we still couldn't finish it.   About $40.00 for brunch.. kind of pricey. Overall, my experience here was okay.. maybe in the near future I will try it again."}

First it's a breakfast and brunch place and they stop serving brunch/breakfast items at at lunchtime?  Say what?  How difficult would it be to keep your grill open to cook breakfast items?    Second, the waiter appeared annoyed after he was told I ordered coffee (my friend even heard me) and he didn't hear that I wanted coffee and water.    Third, the food was marginal at best.  Maybe because I didn't have any appetite having spent the night and day before at EDC but man, the black bean soup tasted like sea water.  They salted the heck outta that beans till it flew outta the cuckoos nest.    Two of my friends, didn't like the Tomato Soup, which looked like they put some care into it's presentation, but the taste buds don't lie.  Unfortunately, I can only recommend that you don't Eat at Eat."}

The hopes were mostly kind of silly (looking for a live DJ! Wanting to drink a mimosa!), but some of them were just basics of eating out (having a server who didn't treat me like serving me was the last thing they wish they were doing, bringing maple syrup with pancakes) and those were kind of a big deal.  I know that sometimes I like to order odd things. In the case of eat. I ordered a pancakes based meal and a side of grits. I asked to switch bacon for sausage. I don't know if that's considered a big deal in some areas, but I've never thought it to be a huge thing in the past. Then my husband ordered. Then the waitress said to our table, guys orders are always so much easier than girls. Wha??? I think she was just talking smack about me to my face and to our whole table because I asked to switch sausage for bacon? That alone would have been enough to make me feel uneasy with my meal, but the rest of the meal kind of went along the same route - taking a long time for refills of coffee or water, not bringing any syrup with pancakes and not checking in on us for long enough we had to flag someone else down who did bring us the syrup so I could eat my lukewarm meal.  Anyway, the pancakes were actually really, really good. The other food was average. But, none of it was worth feeling like I was a hassle for trying to eat breakfast there."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This popular, new DT nook reminds me of a trendy NYC brunch hangout. It's not so much the food or the decor that causes me to reminisce, it's the fact that this place has limited seating, excess patrons, and folks will wait a long time for a table even though there are other good restaurants within walking distance.  If you're dining alone, you can plant yourself at the counter almost immediately. If you're with a group. The wait can be as long as 45 mins, and unlike Hash-House-a-Go-Go, which also always has a long wait, they don't have a pager to give you and you can't just sashay up to the bar while you wait for a table.  I will tell you, these guys really care about their customers.  When I received my Downtown Benedict (one of their signature dishes) I found that the poached eggs were hard boiled.  I didn't even complain, but the manager noticed a look of disappoint on my face and rushed in and had the dish re-fired.  The Benedict was not bad. I picked up a slightly off-putting vinegar flavor from it.  There was probably too much vinegar in the poaching liquor.  The side of skillet-grilled potatoes was pretty good (fresh not frozen). Hollandaise sauce had a smooth, creamy texture. All ingredients tasted fresh, and the plating and presentation was, as I like to say, pretty.   I would recommend Eat. It may not blow you away, but it's a decent breakfast haven.  Just be aware of the wait and the noise."}

One of the people I was with has a service dog. We put our name on the waiting list. Eventually, we are next to be seated and there was a four-top table in the front of the restaurant. It was a really beautiful day, so we were excited to get the table by the window. However, the hostess came to inform us that we have to be seated in the back area. Upon asking why, she replied that it VegeNation's policy to seat service animals outside. We specifically asked to be at the open table by the window. With attitude, she told us, no. Bewildered but starving at this point, we just agreed to go outside. Like I said, it was a nice day... It was actually my birthday. So, I didn't exactly want to get into things.   Our server was so forgetful. She got our orders wrong for different things. We needed to remind her two or three times about the same forgotten item. It was extremely disappointing. There were also periods of time where it seemed like she disappeared - almost like she forgot to come check on us. There was also a table next to us that was full of dishes. It was left for the entire time we dined.   There was also an employee on break or something outside on the table by us. He was sleeping or listening to music with his eyes closed. Ordinarily, I wouldn't care but it just seemed like it was the employee break room as opposed to a dining area. Later in the meal, two employees came outside to another one of the tables to do silverware, so it added to the break room feel.   During our meal, a couple was seated outside. After a few minutes, they requested to be seated inside, and their request was honored.   Later, we inquired again why we were forced to sit outside. Another employee said that there was a person with a dog allergy inside, so they had to seat us in the back. At this point, I'm livid. Was it a restaurant policy or because it was somehow known that someone had a dog allergy? Someone lied to us. And, on top of all that, the restaurant is NOT allowed to do this. Regardless of either reasons, it is not allowed. According to Nevada State Law, they are not allowed to force us to eat in a specific section (i.e., outside) because we had a service animal in our party. The management will be receiving a more detailed letter regarding this matter. I really hope they take this into consideration when making policies or training their employees.   Food was okay. Nothing special. Service was horrible. It isn't very often that I leave a food establishment actually mad. This was one of them."}

We came for brunch, and the brunch menu is different from the breakfast menu online so the truffled egg sandwich I wanted to order wasn't actually on the menu. :( Instead, I had beignets, which were just ok. They were moist and doughy, not the light fluffy texture I associate with beignets. There was a box of Cafe du Monde beignet mix sitting on a shelf in the kitchen so I guess maybe they use that? But the texture was unlike the real thing and not even like the ones I've made with the same mix at home. They were served with a really tasty jam that greatly improved the flavor, though.  I also found the coffee to be a bit weak, which is normally not something I would not even bother to mention, but I think it's important for a breakfast/brunch spot to have great coffee.  My husband had a chicken-fried steak which I did not sample. I did try all of the accompaniments, though, and the potatoes, eggs and especially the toast were all pretty delicious. Maybe savory food is the way to go here!  Our waitress was pleasant if a bit scattered and we did get seated right away despite it being basically peak breakfast time. I am willing to give eat another shot- I hear that a dog-friendly patio is in the works so since we live, like, ridiculously close, we will be back, pug in tow, for weekday breakfast or maybe lunch when that opens up."}

On the upside, my husband and I checked in receiving 2 free sangrias which we were happy about cause they are very pricey on the menu. On the downside, they tasted mediocre at best. I didn't even finish mine and I'm still curious as to why they are so expensive when they tasted the way they did. On the upside, the meatball sub and the chicken pot pie saved the meal and were worth the money.

I get it, it's a popular time to eat, but I what I don't get is waiting 25 minutes to seated then having to wait another 10 minutes before we even get to meet out server for the morning. Thirty five minutes in total waiting and all I have received is a cup of water and some coffee. Personally, I would avoid Eat. on Sundays for brunch, because this place gets packed!  I suggested this place to some friends and family after reading a few Eat's reviews, for the most part they have good reviews with a few minor hiccups along the way. We arrived and after studying the menu for the past half hour we were finally able to sit down. The hostess took us to our table and almost immediately we were greeted with waters and a notification that out server would be right back to help us... fast forward to us looking at the menu for the 7th time and wondering when/if our bellies would ever get full on this beautiful Sunday morning, out of nowhere our server finally appears pen and paper in hand. After a few quick menu questions and our table having to explain to our server what a Frittata is, our food order was put in and breakfast was on it's way.   FOOD TIME: As a group we ordered the cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote. These were ok, the cinnamon flavor was lacking and the biscuit fell apart at every turn, but the compote was quite delicious and I found myself going back for more.     I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. First off this had a beautiful presentation, the way the food was laid on the plate was fantastic and really made me want to dive right in. This order comes with two huge bacon strips, two over medium eggs, two fairly large butterflied shrimp, all placed on a mound of grits. This meal was ok, it had good flavor, but needed a just a kick of spice on the back end. Also it arrived cold. Which I thought was weird because I was the last person at our table to get my food.   During our meal a few things were definitely noted...   - Our server was M.I.A., we didn't see her again until the check was dropped.  - The server or food runner forgot to bring out one of our diners toast. Since our server had disappeared. We asked the hostess for assistance and she quickly delivered the toast.  - Our table was also lacking condiments; ketchup, salsa, and tabasco. After a few attempts get to someone's attention, my GF's mom got up and went into the kitchen and asked for the missing items herself.  - Our waters were filled only once the entire time we ate. I'm not looking for a running river here, but a refresher of the water glasses would be nice.   I really wanted to like this place. It has a great ambiance and decor, but when the food and the customer service are not a in fully symbiotic relationship other things tend to follow suit.   EAT. is NOT A-Ok, but just ok. I believe in second chances so I will be back, but I will be avoiding the Sunday brunch crowd."}

He initially sat us in separate tables that were no where near each other. Hello?.. we came here to eat together. When a larger table (2 standard tables that was push together) opened up, we kindly asked the manager if it will be okay to sit there instead. He agreed and as he walked away, he whispered what's the point?. How rude is that? We were expecting for our whole party to sit at the larger table we requested  but instead the manager pulled the tables apart. Uhhh..We wanted the tables to be pushed together so my party and I could eat at the same table! When we asked a staff if we could push the tables together, the manager overheard and yelled NO!

USE A TRAY TO CARRY EVERY SINGLE DRINK AND THINGS you need to bring to the table, like chopsticks, cream, teapot, soy sauce, etc.  6. When you return with the drinks, tell the guests about the menu. Give them a few more minutes to decide.  7. Take a spin through your section with your tray and take a look at every table and see if they need anything.  8.

Bring whatever the freak any table that doesn't have their food yet needs, like chopsticks, soy sauce, sugar, ketchup, napkins, knives, whatever is necessary so that when you put food down, the customer can eat or drink it without waiting for the incompetent waiter to bring it.  13. DON'T MAKE PEOPLE WAIT TO EAT ONCE YOU'VE BROUGHT THEIR FOOD. Have everything they need already on the table.  14. Bring people apps THEN entrees.  15. Refill drinks if necessary.  16.

You just don't know how to do it. Read this to the staff.  Now for the busboys or girls. 1. Constantly cruise the sections and take away empty or dirty dishes. 2. Refill waters. 3. Say to people May I take your plate?  You don't have to use hand gestures and wave your hand all over the table.  Be discreet, people go out to dinner to enjoy themselves, not involve you. 4. It's not that hard.  You should have one big staff meeting and clear this up immediately upon reading this.  Hostesses: 1. Stand at the podium with a smile on your face. 2. Say hello or good morning/afternoon/evening to guests. 3. Ask how many and seat them with a smile. 4. Stay off your phone, don't smoke, and keep smiling. 5. Look people in the eye.

I was excited to try this little joint but wasn't wowed like most of the folks seem to be.   The service was friendly, fast and accurate and the mood of the restaurant was very California hipster vibeish, which should be expected for a place like eat.  I had the 2 eggs, bacon and chive potatoes breakfast for $10 with $3 passion iced tea, my hubby had the huevos monteluños for $11 and $4 OJ and he was not too thrilled about the overwhelming flavors that weren't mixed in well.   The main complaint on his part was that there were some bites that were too spicy and some that were too sweet, therefore the concoction didn't seem to pair off very well but he still liked the meal.  I on the other hand can't justify paying $10 for a mediocre breakfast. The portions were very small and it was nothing special. I would have liked to have ordered something different but there wasn't too much on the menu to choose from. So I opted for the simple, expecting that at least the size of the meal would compensate for the lack of wow factor.

My husband got the pancakes which were not bad but they were just pancakes. The service was weird. We came in with our infant and were told we could not flip over the high chair for insurance reasons and from there it just seemed like our table was a nuisance. We were never asked if our food was to our liking or if we needed refills. Our check was dropped off before we were even half way done with our meal. And we were seated right by the waiters station so you would expect some level of attentiveness.

I arrived and the place was packed with the local suits indicating a popular place considering it is off the beaten path a bit. I was impressed that the owner was working the line putting pickles, chips and love into each meal.  I ordered the roast beef with bleu cheese, pickled onions, wild mushrooms. The roast beef was tender but underseasoned.   I was disappointed that the mushrooms didn't seem wild at all but looked like the button mushrooms you buy at any store.  There wasn't enough bleu cheese, which for me is saying alot since I am not a huge bleu cheese fan.   The chips were homemade but could have used some seasoning.   Some of them were rubbery.  The menu is limited but everyone seemed to be enjoying their food.  Perhaps I chose a bad menu item.  Some of the sandwiches seemed large for a lunch meal and the bread looks very thick.  This sandwich and the ciabattas themselves were smaller and just the right size as I was full on the last bite.   I will go back to try other menu items as the  menu does have some interesting combinations and all the local hype about the owner/chef has me wondering if maybe the roast beef wasn't the best order.  Still, while the food is good and the atmosphere lively and I love the owner's open participation, I cannot say this is a must for your restaurant rotations.  The drinks are also overpriced with a soda costing $3.00 and it is uphill from there."}

We did complain - no response, no customer service. Additionally this is 2013, how do they not carry gluten free sandwich options?  Place has great potential. Would really love to see them become more customer service oriented. This seems to be a problem throughout Vegas and what keeps us from being a world class city. Backwards mentality. Short term profit instead of customer loyalty. Good luck with that!"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I've been hearing about this place and was excited for a new breakfast place that also sources local, supports local artist and is on the pulse of the growth of downtown. It's already sounding like my kind of place with a strong ethos for community and quality.  The banner says, eat.  A breakfast and lunch place. was actually a breakfast THEN lunch place. Wish I knew before  going down there that they do not serve both together. Weekdays breakfast is stopped at 11am, then lunch until 3pm. Weekends is brunch until 2pm.    We order up the killer grilled cheese since that was sounding good to the BF. The tomato soup it came with was really good. It was a bit cheesy and creamy and like there was chunks of tomato in it, not just puree, which I prefer. The grilled cheese was just OK, though I generally will enjoy thick buttery toast. Nothing mindblowing.  I couldn't decide between the shrimp po boy or the pot pie and chose the chicken pot pie since it sounded good to the BF. I blackjacked on the wrong one. The flavor was decent, but as I got to the bottom there was soggy crust that absorbed all of the sauce from the filling and made the filling thicker than pot pies normally are. The top was crunchy enough and it would have been better if they just did the top and skipped the bottom crust as it won't crisp right in a thick and shallow ramekin. The egg on top was over medium-hard and had a bit crisp burnt edges and wished it was yolky good. The salad it came with was very light and fresh though. Very fresh mixed greens, shredded carrot, sprouts, tomatoes.   As much as I wanted to love the food here, soup and salad shouldn't have been the best part and nothing impressed my socks off.  Also, I thought for $4 for ice tea, it would taste better or be unique passionfruit. It was standard tropical ice tea flavor, but it had that oversteeped taste so I didn't really clamor for refills.  Service was on the cusp of adequate. It was odd how quiet our server was. I asked for something and he just made the slightest of nods and walked away to another table which left me a bit thinking if he was gonna get it or not. He did end up bringing me some hot sauce. He just put the check on the table, no acknowledgement or asked if there was anything else, while we were eating or checking to see if we want our ice tea topped. He wasn't mean, but I guess wasn't friendly either. Seeing their website talking about the importance of people, you'd think this would be the warmest just-like-home service spot.   I see that the hype and the love is for breakfast or weekend only items. If stuff like the shrimp and grits, the huevos montulenos and eggs benedict (weekends only) gets people talking this place up, then have that magic stuff available always!  I don't get why the switch in menus considering this place is open only until 3pm weekdays. Vegas is a nightlife industry so you would think they would try to catch as much local support as possible and have breakfast for swing shift and graveyard, not just the AM folks who work at the government buildings in downtown.   The menus are small that combining it would be 20 items. It's not impossible to make breakfast items as well as salads and sandwiches of the lunch menu. I get simplifying to make it easy to prepare, but then I would expect it to just KILL that execution and flavor when you're making a pot pie special, 5 sandwiches and plating already cooked soup and mixing salads. With small menus you would expect a jes ne sais quoi with everything you order. If they were to have breakfast items all day, I would maybe give it a chance again before heading into work.   I'm so so sad I had to rant instead of rave of this place. I started this review as a 3star, but it felt more suited to a 2star by the end of it. I haven't been this disappointed in a long while. This much talked about breakfast will have to elude us then. I just don't see us making the effort to wake up outside of our sleep pattern to be here early for a place that left us with doubt."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant, but I was disappointed.  Not the healthiest vegan restaurant.  I had the East West Taco, which wasn't good.  I didn't like the taste of the jack fruit and the bbq it was seasoned with (and neither did the people I was with that tried it).  My friend had the mushroom pizza, which was decent, but would've been much better if they used something other than Daiya cheese.  Daiya, in my opinion (and many others) is the bottom of the barrel.  There are so many other much better tasting vegan cheeses out there like Follow your Heart or Chao.  I don't see why any restaurant would use it other than because it's cheap.  My husband had the meatball parmesan sub, which was good, but these aren't homemade, they are outsourced.  The chicken that they use is not homemade either.  It's Gardein brand...which again, is bottom of the barrel and not a healthy option (soy protein isolate).  The waffles were really good, those seem to be made in-house.  The dessert that we all split was amazing.  It was a donut topped with icecream and it was delicious.  That was the best part of the lunch.   All in all, I think if they made more homemade quality food, this place would be awesome.  I'm from NJ and have tried many Vegan places, including By Chloe in NY, and this place just doesn't come close to the quality of food I've had at any of the places.  I come to Vegas every year and get amazing vegan food at the mainstream restaurants, so I probably won't be returning to this all Vegan restaurant (unfortunately).  I do hope that the restaurant reads my review and takes it constructively and makes some changes.  Homemade food is key.  If they use Gardein and outsource meatballs (one of the easiest and most delicious things to make vegan) I can only imagine what else is outsourced."}

There is nothing soft around to absorb sound, so don't expect to have a conversation.  The music did tone down after a bit...but not because they lowered it.  Everyone who does talk has to raise his voice to be heard, so the sound escalates as the restaurant fills.  I had to put in the earplugs I always have with me.  My chicken pot pie used puff pastry underneath and on top of the filling.  The filling was okay; I didn't detect a lot of chicken in it, but it wasn't all sauce like some--mostly veggies I think.  The bottom crust couldn't be crispy, and the top crust wasn't either--so I just ate arouond the edges.  The chicken sandwich was ordinary, and the potato salad tasted more like the packaged salad in a regular market.  The one I make myself is much better.  It's unlikely we will return.

I've seen good reviews here, so this Southern girl thought I might keep an open-minded and step out the pork zone for a bit.   Facility: Small cafeteria feel, but hipster place located in the same strip mall as Zydeco and Glutton. Guess I won't talk about Zydeco having the best catfish and Glutton having my favorite burger in Vegas so I won't gross out the Vegetable peeps reading this. LOL!  Service:  although there were 4 wait staff walking around this small room, I can't believe how many times I attempted to waive someone over to be ignored. I was really disappointed, because when they finally did see me standing on the table with bright orange cones waiving them in, they were very nice to speak with. All of them...very pleasant dispositions.    Food:  yeah, um...how do I say this politely...nope! Not for me. I like a good salad and I love vegetable side dishes, etc, so I thought there would be something yummy to me here. The food was just super bland. Spices are ok in the vegan menu, right?   Now before you cast me back to my red meat roots...yes, I admit there was pork fat back in my baby bottle, but I really do love veggies. At Italian restaurants, when I order pasta, I usually only order vegetables in it. I can skip the meat...however, I can't skip out on flavor, and in my opinion they did.  Mexican Hummus - 2/5 - did not take like hummus, rather just plain black beans. At least there was a half of a jalapeño in there I cut up and added to each chip.  Tamales - 2/5 - bland, bland, bland. I had to ask for salt, and then added it to the hummus too. I like the masa, the pumpkin and chiles, but it was just so boring and bland. The waitress said she likes to ask for extra chiles...doesn't that tell you something? Ravioli - 3/5 - ok, this one was ok, but too sweet. I guess it was the sweet potatoes, but it almost seemed if they added sweetener, like honey or something. I like my pasta savory, not sweet.   Overall:  I apologize to all the Vegans that love this place, but in my defense, even my long-time strict Vegan friend told me it was very bland and disappointing to her too. I mainly gave it a 3 instead of a 2, because the staff were so polite and nice, and even comped my tamales. However...it was just not enough for a good dinning experience.  Im sorry, but I won't be back. :("}

And the Pancakes were very nicely done. I particularly appreciated the little jars of  real maple syrup they came with. But getting plain and simple pancakes just isn't my thing - I need them full of granola, smothered in Nutella and topped with strawberries because I'm that kind of crazy girl.   The best, most special thing I had was definitely the deviled Eggs. They were panko-encrusted and fried, then topped with bacon. Now we're talking!  Maybe I should've tried their cinnamon biscuits topped with strawberries. It seems to be one of their most popular dishes and based on the Pancakes and the amazing bread the provide to go with just about every plate, they do Grain-based dishes best."}

The location didn't bother me as it seemed to bother other reviewers. You have to pay for parking which is inconvenient if you don't have change, but I was willing to do that if the food was good. Sadly, it wasn't.  First of all our server was very aggressive. He put his hand on the back of my chair and leaned in close to my personal space. He creeped me out. I appreciate friendliness but I don't appreciate you getting really close to me. My husband noticed it right away too.  We had coffee while waiting for our order. It wasn't horrible or anything- I've had much worse- but it tasted over extracted, like they were skimping on the amount of coffee used to brew it. At $3 a cup (yep, $6 in total for two mugs of coffee), it should taste better than that.  My husband ordered shrimp & grits and he loved it. He ordered it because that's the dish he heard others raving about.  I ordered the eggs benedict and holy moly, the sauce was SOUR! Not a good kind of sour either. The bacon was also limp and chewy. Yes, it was turkey bacon, which I eat at home all the time, but it didn't even taste like it was cooked. It was really gross.  The serving size was small, but that wouldn't have bothered me if the food actually tasted good. I don't like stuffing myself with huge portions at breakfast, but it's hard to not feel ripped off when you paid $13 for english muffins with limp bacon and sour hollandaise sauce.  The ambience was cool and hipster-ish. I think it's cool that they let their waiters have tattoos and dyed hair, but that doesn't make the food taste better or the waiter less creepy. Also the music was far too loud, my husband and I could barely have a conversation.  Final verdict: waste of money for now. The place is new, maybe they'll work the kinks out. If they changed a few things this place could be great but I'm not returning for now."}

It's a local spot that has a great sense of community with emphasis on all things comfort. All ingredients are responsibly sourced with leafy greens locally sourced. The space comes together with different elements from the green colored walls, to the exposed brick with the mixture of mismatched paintings and decor. Bringing in a bright and relaxed atmosphere, great breakfast brunch vibe that's rumored to push out pretty damn good comfort food.   We all ended up getting sandwiches which were all served on their ciabatta bun, let's just rave over how perfect this bread was. Crisp outer layer with the soft spongy interior that soaks up all the juices and sauces that are layered on. Talk about levels of flavour. Who knew the bun that a sandwich is served on could elevate the meal so much more.   Shrimp Po'Boy - ($14) - Juicy sautéed shrimp topped with spicy napa slaw and cilantro finished with a sriracha mayo. This was a darn good sandwich. Spicy mayo and the spicy slaw gave a really good kick in flavour and there was a hefty amount of shrimp stuffed in between. Recommend 100%  Roast Beef - ($14) - The flawless layers of roast beef with another flawless layer of arugula, presentation alone was captivating. Served with mayo with sprinkles of pickled red onions, this was a heavy sandwich compared to the shrimp but flavours were awesome and also really satisfying.    Free Range Chicken - ($12) One of the more basic sandwiches with the added addition of their pesto mayo; which was probably the ingredient that stood out the most. Added with that ciabatta bun and boy, this basic juicy chicken sandwich just leveled up to a whole new experience.  All of the sandwich choices had a slice of pickle and the added option of choosing between chip, soup,salad or potato salad. I opted for chips and the other two got the potato salad. My chips were yummy, but the potato salad wasn't a crowd pleaser for us. Not creamy enough to our liking I suppose.   Service wasn't spectacular. Had to ask our server twice for a water refill, huffed when we wanted to clarify the brunch menu items and all in all didn't seem pleased that she had to serve us. she also didn't remember to add our orange juice to the bill, which made up for the shoddy service."}

I'll start off by saying that most of the food was really good but they have a super slow kitchen. Restaurant wasn't full. 20 minutes for appetizer, another 30 for the entree. Everyone around was twiddling their thumbs. The free sangria with check-in was a nice plus while waiting...  The food: Buffalo Cauliflower had too much sauce and could have been crispier Bao Wow was not marinated or seasoned well. It just tasted like plain tofu with blah mushrooms. A suggestion would to have used jackfruit and cooked it down like with the flavors of a bao pork bun. Pot pie gnocchi and pineapple pizza were awesome.   Not sure if it's just because they are newer but their kitchen needs to make a few changes to be more efficient. Maybe the next time I'm in Vegas I'll give it another try."}

I had to wait until the next pumper came out to warm it up...and the new batch was still pretty weak and watery tasting.  But coffee isn't what sells a place, the food is.  My husband got the shrimp and grits.  It was good, the shrimp tasted very fresh, but at $12 (and 3 shrimp), it was a little steep.  I got the Huevos Motulenos which is eggs, red and green chili, and bananas (weird, I know, but I wanted to try it).  Again, it was good.  Just good.

We were seated right away both times (yay) but waited at least 10-15 minutes before the server acknowledge our presence. The place isn't big at all so even if you're busy you can at least say hello to your table!  The first time, I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with potato salad. The sandwich is ginormous and 90% bread and 10% cheese. While the cheese was yummy, you could barely taste it with all that frikkin bread. Should be more cheesy in my opinion. Shrug. But to each his own. And the server gave me chips instead of potato salad. When I asked her to bring me the salad, she seemed perturbed. Geez! It was your mistake, not mine.  The second time, we waited 15 minutes to order, very frustrating. Especially when you only have an hour for lunch. I ordered the two eggs over easy with chive potatoes and bacon. For $11 I expected something goooood. WRONG. My eggs arrived well over medium (no gooey yolk to dip my bacon in, booooo.) The potatoes were overcooked and maybe four bites worth, and the bacon way too crispy. Guess the cook forgot about my breakfast and just let it sit there overdone.   When I asked for jam for my toast, again the server seemed hassled by my request. Is it just me? Do I have a booger on my face? I didn't ask for new eggs because I don't like to complain (nor do I risk saliva or snot in my food). Very disappointed at both of my visits.  This place has let me down twice in guest experience and food. I will never go again. Overrated."}

So, as for the food, it was good, but neither of us was particularly impressed. I ordered the pancakes, my husband ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. The pancakes were golden brown and fluffy, and served with two small containers of maple syrup and butter on the side. Perhaps because I recently had a great experience with plain buttermilk pancakes at another restaurant, these pancakes, while good, were nothing special. If there was no wait, I'd probably come back.

The grits weren't flavored and the eggs were supposed to be cooked over easy- it was more like medium. The shrimp were few and weren't seasoned. Maybe I'll try something less ambitious on the menu. The service was a bit lackluster too. If we weren't seated by the cart full of supplies (straws, hot sauce etc.) then we would've been waiting on condiments for a while.

No big deal if the server mentioned it. I also ordered a serving of rice.  And  cheesecake with blueberries for dessert. Well, the veggies were overcooked and almost swimming in oil.  The rice portion was fine.  Cheesecake was just okay. I found the server aggressive in asking for the payment.  Card or do you need change?  When I gave her cash, again, do you need change?  Hey, why don't you just give me my change and I'll tip you accordingly!  I definitely will not be back. Food was not pleasing, service was pushy, and there must have been some gluten somewhere.

The bright orange chairs, open (small) kitchen, and calligraphy on the walls make you feel like you stepped into a Cali spot.  I was bummed that during the week it's breakfast or lunch depending on when you arrive. I had my heart set on the spicy egg dish and the beignets. I will return for this indeed. Our lunch was decent. Average. Nothing bad but nothing spectacular. My favorite part was the fresh avocado on my BLTA, and the in house chips they make. My bf's tomato soup and grilled cheese was good, but didn't stand out.  Also I understand the whole local, fresh thing, but nix the organic lemonade. It was gross. Needed sugar. Blah.  Overall I wasn't impressed nor disappointed. The prices were hi. For a whole in the wall on Carson, $12 a sandwich and $4 a lemonade is rough.

When it is busy in there, it is loud... VERY LOUD!!   Hard painted concrete floors and a hard ceiling painted black.  When the place is packed, it is rough to enjoy the conversations you're having with the people at your table. There comes a certain point where enough people leave after a rush and you realize that there is background music just below the noise floor of the very loudest rush so it never settles down completely there volume-wise.   I've never had a single experience there where I've been completely happy at the end.   I'd love if they spent a few bucks on some black acoustic treatment on the ceiling to match the decor.

The sandwich did have a satisfyingly truffle-y fragrance, but other than that it was a solid egg sandwich.  A little dry but good.  Some sort of sauce would have set it off.  The potatoes were really nothing special.  The pancakes were probably the highlight....there was just *something* that made them really delicious.  Have you ever had malasadas in Hawaii????

The cinnamon biscuits my sister got were alright--nothing special. She noted it could have used like whipped cream or sweet cheese or something to cut the tartness of the berry compote, and I totally agree. The cinnamon biscuits were definitely lacking that extra something to really round of the dish.   Overall, good, not great.

I wanted to love them. But the bun itself wasn't steamed long enough and was still sticky dough on the inside.  I think it was because they were so much thicker than the usual bun.  Also, the tofu, mushrooms, and spinach did not give any textual difference.  No crunch.  I think tempeh would have been a more exciting protein on the bun.  Also, I needed more sauce.  Then, I had the tamale.  It could have been great.   But it was far to thick.  Like, big cylinders.  The masa was a bit dried out in places.  The filling however was delicious. I think the whole thing would have benefited from a sauce of some kid to accompany it.  Service was kind and lovely.

We have been patrons here for over a year and the food, while usually so delicious, has had so many inconsistencies. Tonight was the last straw.   Customer Service: Usually mediocre but the food is so great that we always come back or order delivery. The hostesses love to put us on hold for long periods and then hang up when we call to place an order. The best is that they like to forget items that you paid for- calling Grubhub or Postmates to get a refund is never a fun, wasted 15 minutes of my day. Most of the time, the place seems as if its being ran by an after school, high school club.   Tonight (I'm assuming they were out of their normal cheese) they used something similar to a bad, upsetting version of a cheese substitute. Very gooey and sticky but to the point of making you want to puke.. or highly consider it. No one bothered to say that they changed the recipe in the last week or were out of the normal ingredient. Again, we order these pizzas once or twice a week. The tamales are great when they are great, but 5 times out of 8, they are dry, bland, and burned. The last and only time i've ordered the Pho, the broth was so bland. Tasted like water with floating mushrooms. The eggplant stack would be good in theory.. however the bottom and edges were burned to the point of tasting like old, burned, oil crisps. The first time I had the buffalo cauliflower wings, they were amazing! The next two times they had a weird smell and tasted like perhaps they were cooked with the same oil as the brunch items... but hours later.   The point here is that the inconsistency with the food is such a real problem. I LOVE to see vegan businesses thrive here! However, it looks like this is going to be one that loses our support. I absolutely hate yelpers that have had one bad experience (or lie) and rant just to get a free meal. I am not that person. I never give bad reviews, but I feel as we have been abused more times that necessary since we remained loyal customers despite the inconsistencies. Which is my fault I suppose for always coming back. I can only hope that they get it together before losing more business.   Order and spend your money here at your own risk.

No offense but ihop & Denny's has WAY better looking French toast. (AND NO WE DO NOT EAT AT IHOP OR DENNY'S just giving an accurate comparison!)

It comes with black bean chili, scrambled tofu, spiced potatoes, vegan cheese, & avocado with chipotle cream. Sounds pretty effin' amazing, right?! ..WRONG!  Sadly, the only warm part of my meal were the potatoes at the very bottom. The meal actually consisted of 99% potatoes & beans. And it was totally TASTELESS!

After having a sample of everyone's dishes, I like the shrimp and grits the best and the fluffy pancakes the second. I did not like the Eggs Benedict (who invented turkey bacon?) and my corned beef was not that great.  I thought the plates all had a beautiful presentation but many of the flavors did not come together for me. There were other items I would love to try but after sampling several dishes, I'm not in a hurry to come back here but not opposed to it if someone wanted to come here.  Service was good and we were constantly checked on but felt like they were trying to hurry us for the next table. Good for people waiting. I'm not one to linger after I finish eating so it wasn't a big deal."}

The majority of our party was there aside from one friend with a baby. They wouldn't seat us until the entire party was there, which I normally understand though I think they should make an exception when babies are involved and all but one member of the party are there. I would not recommend this place for families.   They closed the patio as apparently it's not open during the week, which was disappointing. It was a beautiful day and that space would have been perfect for our party.  My sister and I split the breakfast burrito, which was delicious!, and the biscuits, which were not worth it.   The service was slow and the credit card machine was down, which didn't help, but I understand that definitely happens.   Overall, I wouldn't choose this place for brunch again."}

I've walked past Vegenation many times, but never stopped in because I'm not exclusively vegan and just end up picking other options in the area: it's a very competitive corner of DTLV. However, I like to partake in plant based options from time to time for health reasons and also love having dairy free options because lactose intolerance is the devil.   The restaurant itself is very clean, beautiful, green: the message comes across very clear. The menus are also cute and the description of dishes all sounded devine. Service was initially friendly and that's where it ended for me. Our hostess seemed to spend most of her time in the kitchen. She did check up on us once, but there were three other workers actively on the floor being inactive? Not sure if they were clocked out or what, but did everything to avoid eye contact/questions and weren't super friendly. It was confusing to say the least.  I ordered the thai curry vegetable bowl and my friend ordered the tamales and chili and black bean stuffed sweet potato. Everything was so bland! I could smell the curry in my plate, but I couldn't taste it because it was drowned in coconut milk and not seasoned otherwise. My friend's food was the same. We decided to wash down dinner with dessert and were excited to have a vegan version of cheesecake and ordered that. The texture was weird and the cake was hard. The blueberry compote on top was very bitter like it was made with unripe berries. I ultimately wish that the staff would review the recipes for some of these dishes because they need work on the flavor big time. This is not my first time eating vegan, but it was my first time eating at a vegan restaurant in Vegas and normally wouldn't bother me quite so much, but the price tag that came along with the meal was not worth it for bland food. Hope they improve soon."}

I knew this place was in the area and after a quick Google search, found it to be on a couple of blocks from where we were.   So from Freemont Street we walk over. It's about 1PM on a Wednesday. We're seated immediately. After our hot walk through the sun we were pretty damn thirsty. Sadly, we waited over 5 minutes for our waitress to stop at our table and then another few minutes just for her to grab us some waters.   Before I go to into detail on the service, let's talk about the food. I have no complaints. It's a breakfast/lunch place. It's sandwiches. My seared chicken sandwich was pretty good. Juicy, and the house made mayonnaise was solid. Also, their potato salad is on point. Again, very good. My fiancé ordered the Reuben and honestly it was huge. I had a bite and really could just tell by the look of it that it was going to be good. Good/great food and for the price I had no complaints.   Now the service on the other hand? Not so great. I noticed the sign near the door that said maximum occupancy was 86 people. There were maybe 20-25 people, if that? And three waiters/waitresses for those tables. So when I said I was pretty thirsty when we walked in, I really was. I downed my water in a minute or two and then sat there for the next ten minutes looking for our waitress who was nowhere to be found. I noticed she was waiting on our table and the table of four next to us. Then a different guy came up and started waiting on us. Okay, no big deal. He stops at our table and asks if I want more water - the glass is empty and we don't even have our food yet...what the hell do you think?!?  Female waitress eventually comes back after the male waiter dropped off our food. She asked if we needed anything, etc etc. She then disappears again and that was the last we saw of her basically. Male waiter brought our bill and rung it up.   Overall the food was good and the price was fair but the service needs some work. I shouldn't be waiting ten minutes for a refill on water. And why did my original waitress just disappear? And why is this all happening with maybe 25 people in the place?   Bottom line is I would hate to see this place packed and with a line of people waiting to be seated. Bourdain brought me here by watching his show, but I'm not sure I'd be running back the next time I'm in town."}

I consider all of those things against each other and sometimes they balance each other out. I wanted to like this place more, but it was just a turn off for me.  eat. has been on my radar forever, but they don't fit into my work schedule since they only serve breakfast brunch. It's in a cute space downtown where you'll find a wide variety of patrons.  Our server was so blah. He was super rude when he walked up to us and asked us rather rudely what we wanted. I want to say it was a , know what you want? No hi or anything. I really hate patronizing places with bad customer service but I whatever, I paid for metered parking. lol jk he also brought us one refill on our drink. When we were paying. Enough about that.  My food was good. It wasn't great. It wasn't drool worthy. It was picture worthy though.  We got the deviled eggs, shrimp and grits, and the Reuben with tomato soup. We got their house brewed citrus tea.  The shrimp and grits was good. The bacon makes the dish. I wish the grits were thicker and more flavorful. It was good and the portion of shrimp was good.  The Reuben sandwich had the thickest slices of bread. The meat was okay. It was all just okay.  The tomato soup was good, but not special. Just a well done basic tomato soup.  The tea was good.  The deviled eggs were good. Deep fried hard boiled egg whites then filled with the traditional deviled egg filling and topped with bacon. I could have eaten a dozen of these.  Overall I liked the place. After hyping myself up for months I'd probably not rush back. The service was disappointing, the food wasn't memorable or special, and the cheap tactics of using the huge bread slices was a turn off."}

The pancakes and chicken fried steak are also some of my favorites.  The service is horrible. I never thought the service would keep me from such a great restaurant but it will. I don't ever plan on returning to EAT because the service is just that bad. The wait is always long, so don't come here if you only have a few hours to spare. Once you are seated, it takes forever to get your drinks and order your food. I had to leave one time after I was seated because they were taking forever and I was going to be late to work if I stayed any longer. I also feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman when she is shopping on Rodeo Drive for the first time when I come to EAT. Everyone else seems to be getting star treatment except me. This has happened just about every time I have come.  Overall the food is good but I will probably not be returning because of the service is just horrible."}

There's a light batter coated around the egg, which provides a nice crunch. The bacon is also a nice touch. Has a breakfast-y feel for deviled eggs.  Country fried chicken with potatoes - Looked and smelled amazing. However, the chicken steak, I felt, was under seasoned. The gravy was also under seasoned.

The women sitting us even let us know it might take a minute, totally understandable.

I don't even know the waitresses name and we only saw her a total 3 times for the entire hour and 15 mins we were there. After she brought us waters she never checked on us again until our food came literally 25 MINUTES AFTER we ordered it. Half the restaurant was empty by that time. Didn't even bother asking if we needed refills or apologize for the wait. We even checked in and asked for our free sundaes and only brought us one. The only time we got our drinks refilled was when we were on desert which was by a busser I'm assuming, so we went the entire meal without water because she never cared to come check.  We got the check at the same time since we were already there over an hour and didn't want to wait to find her again.   It was the worst service I've ever had which sucks because we do love coming there, my friends and I. Service is a huge part of making a restaurant survive and acknowledgment or an apology would have been great. I didn't even bother tipping because that's how horrible this service was.  A word to the wise, a server makes their money on tips. If you don't bother to check on your tables the entire night, don't expect a dime for giving shitty service."}

He had the roast beef and he liked it but again not as much meat as salad components it seemed. Gave him my potato salad and he said it wasn't mayo but not sure what it was... Ranch based? He did like his potato chips.  If they put the veggie burger on thinner bread as it said wheat but didn't look like wheat, and more meat on his it would have been better.

The two issues I have are the restaurant space and the service.  The restaurant is a hip, urban eatery with the requisite black ceiling, hewn wood, and minimalist booths paired with vintage looking chairs.  Nice.  But it's loud.  It has a show kitchen where you can see the staff work, and the sounds coming out are to be expected. Since there are all hard surfaces (ceiling, cement floor) the sound carries, but again, that's ok.  What made it uncomfortable was the music which added to the din. We were there at opening time on Sunday morning, and the music was turned up to industrial levels. It was difficult to talk to my husband, and I missed a few things the server said. I just wish the volume was a little lower. The other issue is the service.  Our server was reasonably polite, and that's good, but there were just too many workers there at that time without enough to do, so they wouldn't give us time to enjoy our breakfast.  Our server checked back right away to see how we were doing, which I appreciate, but what really bothered me is that the check was plopped down on our table before we were half done with our meals.  She said 'No rush', but it sure felt like it. There were only four other occupied tables in the place, and no line waiting for a seat.  Three other servers refilled our coffee and water enough, but each time asked us if we wanted to-go boxes and tried to clear our plates before we were half done. I noticed it happening at another table as well.  Whatever you do, don't put down your fork and stop to savor your food because someone will  attempt to take it away from you regardless of how much is left on your plate. I would have liked to have had the opportunity to enjoy my breakfast, but the noise and the servers gave a sense of urgency to get out of there. If we had been there for an hour and was taking a table away from other people waiting, I would understand, but we weren't. We spent $48 (including tip) on breakfast for two, and were only there for about 45 minutes which included being seated, looking at the menu, ordering, eating, and drinking coffee.

The African stew needed a little salt to really bring out all of the flavors, and it wasn't spicy at all (which was disappointing because it was advertised as spicy). The burger was suuuuper mushy. Each time you take a bite, it would come mushing out the other side. It needed a more solid texture and toppings on the burger itself to make the overall texture of the burger not just a big blob of mush. The potato wedges that came with the burger had no flavor whatsoever, so I'm glad it came with some ketchup (but really needed more ketchup than was provided, given the lack of flavor with the burger and the potatoes).

Nearly an hour later, we asked the hostess for a status update, to which she told us she had called us and we did not respond.  What she actually meant was, despite each of us making eye contact with her like little puppies, she called for a party of four, which of course we didn't respond, being a party of five, and she moved down her list.  So after watching the hostess seat everyone else, we asked how much longer to be seated. Another girl (manager?) came over and basically treated our friend like she was in the wrong for not answering to party of four since that's what the hostess meant - us.  We were seated next, waiter was nice, and the food came out quickly (maybe they rushed it for us?). Otherwise they never really acknowledged that they fudged up.   All this being said, the food was pretty good. I had their grilled cheese - you can't really mess up a grilled cheese (note: the bread slices on everything were wicked thick).

Brick walls and simple art and a few rustic wooden tables and I'm in love. One star for ambiance/decor.   We sat down and our waiter came by to take our drink order. He wasn't very nice and had this look on his face like I can't wait to walk away from this table and I couldn't be less interested in what you want to drink. The drink prices are a little ridiculous. Grandma ordered tea: $4 for a cup? And $3 for a soda? Hmmm...  Also, they DO NOT have bottled water. I don't understand this. My mom tried to order bottled water and the rude waiter just said we don't have that. I asked if their water was at least filtered and he said well, it's not tap water but it comes from a fountain. ::blankstare:: What does that even mean? We ordered a glass anyway and it definitely tasted like Vegas tap water. Mom ordered coffee instead and believe it or not, the coffee tasted stale.   I ordered the DWBLT. It was DELICIOUS. I'd give 5 stars just for this sandwich if it weren't for the shitty service and awkwardly unhappy waiter. It came with lettuce, tomato, bacon, avocado and chipotle mayo on toasted sourdough (but it actually tasted more like lightly fried bread?). The flavors were amazing and the bread was soft, but crispy. Also, the bacon was out-of-this-world good. The sandwich was oozing with freshness and definitely one of the best BLTs I've ever had! It came with homemade potato chips which were pretty good too.   My grandma had the chicken caesar salad. She seemed to enjoy it. Mom ordered the chicken sandwich and she loved it. She got potato salad with her sandwich. I took a bite and it was pretty good - not as good as the DWBLT though!    Before we were even finished eating and before our table was cleared, a waiter who wasn't ours walked by and placed our check on the table. I REALLY hate when this happens. I didn't ask for the check yet and it makes me feel rushed. And, how do you know I didn't want to order something else?   I'm not usually this critical, but this restaurant has a lot of potential. It's already popular and the food is wonderful - that's the hard part! The easy part is good customer service... and Eat is severely lacking in that department.   I'll give it another shot , though!"}

Also, they had a loud 2-piece band playing in this small, acoustically challenged restaurant. Without the music playing, you could barely carry on a conversation.  With the music playing, forget about it.  And I'm sure the mothers here loved that they couldn't talk with their children during brunch.  What were they thinking?  However, I will make a 2nd attempt (sans coffee) because the service was good and my wife's corned beef hash was good.  Big ass pancakes looked good too.

Our visit started off on the wrong foot. The wait was long and we were a little discouraged since they were closing in an hour. The hostess who greeted us at the front was very rude and we almost left because of her bad attitude. But we decided to stick it out since we were excited to try the food.   Luckily, after we were seated, we were assisted by different employees and our visit picked up. We ordered the pancakes with chicken apple sausage, egg Benedict daily special, and an avocado BLT. Hubby was not impressed with the Benedict and my friend complained that the bread used for the BLT was too thick and overwhelmed the sandwich. I thought the pancakes were really good.   Another con was the sticker shock. There are a lot of places in Vegas with cheap breakfast specials with similar quality or better food. Anyway, I won't be going back."}

We were pretty underwhelmed, which was disappointing because we really looked forward to eating here because they have a great mission and seem to be one of the first all vegan spots in town. As one of the highest rated and most recommended vegan restaurants in LV, we expected more.    We went on a Friday for lunch. It was not busy but service was super slow. The food was just okay. We shared the buffalo cauliflower wings, and I had the veggie burger and my husband ordered the meatball grinder. Nothing to write home about and definitely not the best meal we had on our trip. My meal made me feel kind of sick afterwards.   I think as more vegan spots open up around town, VegeNation will lose its appeal.

I saw online that the Benedict, truffled eggs and cinnamon biscuits are a must-try. I got the Benedict, my friend ordered the chicken fried steak. I added on the deviled eggs after seeing them go by ( there's 4 pieces).   My Benedict was fair, the hollandaise tasted metallic in flavor, the English muffin was mushy, tomatoes were mushy, with the spinach and egg it as just a lot of much with a weird metallic flavor. I added a ton of salt and pepper as the overall dish was under seasoned.   The pancakes looked amazing, the chicken fried steak gave my friend diarrhea. Sorry tmi.   The main waiter seems tired and not very engaging. The hostess and cocktail waitress (although they don't serve alcohol) were very friendly, nice, chatty and fun.   Highlight: the deviled eggs were deep fried, crispy, topped with a spicy tobasco sauce and bacon. Sooooo good!

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "On the unassuming corner of 7th and Carson Street in Downtown Vegas resides an old institutional blue apartment building which was once surrounded by undesirables and derelicts.  Now it's surrounded by a weekend brunch bunch, eagerly awaiting a table into a place simply called eat.  And to that one syllable name, I offer an equal one syllable description that says it all: good.      After running a 10k in a 80's get-up, a friend, who also ran it but didn't bother dressing up (because she's smart like that) suggested we have breakfast at the nearby eat.  I'm always up for exploring new places since I never get out.  She and her husband were not new to eat and so they suggested that I try the Huevos Motulenos.  I read the ingredients: 2 eggs, red and green chili, black beans, peas, feta, sautéed bananas on corn tortillas.  The discriminating, reserved me would have said, eh, maybe some other time.  But since I was already sticking out like a sore thumb dressed in neon pink leggings, teased hair looking like Madonna circa 1984, I decided, yeah, let's continue this wild new adventure and let me motorboat that dish.    And motorboat it I did.  I probably would've licked the plate, but I didn't want to look like an animal.  My friends stuck with the traditional pancake short stack and had chicken sausage with it.  They look great, but not nearly as adventurous as the Huevos Motulenos.    A band started to set up while we were still eating.  They moved perfectly good seating to make room for the live entertainment.  I've nothing against live entertainment, but it limits the seating to an already small cafe.  I'm glad we got there before the rush because when we left, people were outside waiting to get in.  They may have already solved that problem with setting up some patio seating, or at least it appeared that they were going to at the time when I went.  But honestly, it's Vegas, it's hot and getting hotter and it's doubtful anyone wants patio seating.    To sum it up: if I had to wait, especially if there was a live band playing, I'd probably go some place else.  If there was no wait, I would gladly eat at eat again."}

The place wasn't too busy, there were plenty of open tables, but we still waited close to 10 min.   Food wise, we had to get the beignets to start. When they came, they were smaller than expected. They're also denser than I like, but still quite good. They reminded me of a sugar doughnut hole. The best part of them was the seasonal jam and vanilla scented mascarpone as the dipping sauces. I put so much of those on, it was like eating the dipping sauces with a side of beignet.   For the rest of the meal, the 2 others joining me had the Two Eggs any style with the smashed potatoes, while I tried the Chilaquiles. The Two Eggs any style was nothing to write home about. It was exactly as described, two eggs any style, a slice of bacon, bread, and some potatoes. The smashed potatoes were just cubed potatoes with some seasoning, which was a bit lacking. We all thought it was overpriced since nothing was particularly outstanding. My Chilaquiles was pretty tasty, it was essentially scrambled eggs with tomatoes and peppers over tortilla chips, a sort of breakfast nachos. But the chicken sausage that was sitting on top was a bit too sweet for the dish, it just stood out too much.   The staff was fairly friendly, however the one waitress that brought our check was not exactly rude, but she had some attitude when holding the check out for us. She didn't say anything, but from her body language, she looked annoyed at us for no reason.   Overall, this place was alright.

I'm not vegan but I've been to many vegan/ vegetarian restaurants. I appreciate the art it takes to creat vegan options since there's a lot of ingredients to substitute in the everyday meals most of us eat.   The ambience is beautiful, I love the plants and arts on the walls. The rustic/ modern design is nice, there was a live Dj which really put the beginning experience over the top. We walked in and was quickly seated. Our waitress asked us what we wanted to drink, we gave her our order and off she went. To be honest it took a good 10 15 minutes just to get drinks which was a iced chai and an iced coffee. The long wait didn't really bother us since we were catching up but after awhile it became ridiculous. There were parties that came in after us that got their food before we could order. I kept having to catch our waitress attention just to get her to help us. I'm not sure if she forgot about us because we were somewhat in the corner but the place wasn't busy to not see us. It was about 30 minutes of us sitting there until we got to place our order. Then it took about another half an hour for us to get our food. I ordered the Free the tuna appetizer and meatball sandwich and my sister got the Vegenation sandwich. With the time it took to get our food I expected a lot more. My bread was soggy and the food wasn't even warm it was colder then what I would expect and the fries where so burnt and hard I couldn't it break it in half with my hands. My sisters burger was so mushy that she had to eat it with a fork and her fries weren't better then mine. So sad. I asked for our check and my free Sunday with the Yelp check in. I requested it to go because to be honest I didn't want to have to wait an hour for it. By the time we got our check and was able to pay for our meal we had to rush back to our meatier since the two hours that we added had already expired before we could go on our marry way to the container park.   So with this devastating experience I won't recommend my fellow vegan and vegetarian friends nor will I be back.

I ordered the free-range chicken sandwich with mozzarella, greens, tomatoes, and pesto. You would think this is kind of a healthier choice right? I took one bite and it tastes like POPCORN! I was weirded out...haha. I kept trying to figure out why it tasted like popcorn and then I realized how much butter they put on the bread. It's like they smothered it with layers of butter while toasting it. All I tasted was butter. So this is definitely not a healthy place. Everything is covered in oil, butter, sauce, etc. You get one pickle spear with the dish and even the pickle was not good. I personally believe they should change the brand they buy (again, this is all based off of personal taste. I'm sure other people love it. Why else would everyone rate it so well). You get one side with the sandwich and I got the tomato soup. Once again, nothing out of this world. Oh and maybe they should use a smaller cup to put it in so that the bowl does not look so empty since it's just a side (presentation is important!).   As far as service...mediocre. The girl was helpful and answered my questions but she doesn't seem happy to be at work. Maybe she was having a bad day.

We visited this place twice recently, once on a Tuesday morning, which was a five star visit, and then once on Saturday, which was a one and a half star experience, so I am averaging them out. Our first visit was in a large group, with four adults and three boisterous children, the waiter was unperturbed by our large group and we were seated pretty quickly at the communal table. I had the veggie burger, which was more of a large toasted sandwich of indescribable deliciousness, and an orange juice which, although regular in size was large and pulp free and quite wonderful. One of our friends had the shrimp & grits dish which she absolutely loved as well. The service was good, the food arrived quickly and the multiple servings of grits which my daughter mowed through were hot, scrumptious and seemingly bottomless. Now, Saturday... we waited an exceedingly long time for a table, the hostess told us it would be around 30 minutes, and we were seated in the busiest thoroughfare more than 45 minutes later. The waitress brought our menus, which were considerably smaller than the weekday menu and distinctly lacking in vegetarian options, and then disappeared for an extended period. We asked if they could do the veg burger but they said no, and at this point I didn't want to wait at another restaurant so we decided to stay, I eventually decided on the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo, which does not come with chips - this was not noted on the menu where it actually says that all sandwiches are served with chips or potato salad, but when I asked after the chips I was told they would be an additional side and that the soup, which was part of the meal on the menu, was in fact a side I had ordered. This was a rather awkward exchange and I gave up on my lovely chips. The soup was thin, and the cheese was lurid orange, plasticky processed American cheese instead of the sharp cheddar on the menu. This made me sad. The bread is doorstop thick and soft, which is a perk. We felt very rushed, and they brought the check before we had finished eating, or, in fact ordering, as well as removing dishes before we had finished eating. Its a really fabulous place to eat, during the week, but give the weekends a miss."}

The food was good, but I'm convinced I didn't probably order the best thing on the menu. I went the route of a veggie burger (which I was told they don't make themselves, but they are shipped in, deconstructed, and then more ingredients are added. Probably not my favorite selling point!) but it was delicious and I topped it off with a cup of chicken posole soup.   I did get a little food envy over the grilled cheese at times!!!! HUGE Texas toast with a nice gooey cheesy filling? Yes, please!"}

Service was good, everyone was very friendly, and the decor is super cute & warm!   Our group ordered: fried devil eggs $8 - really yummy spin on your normal deviled eggs. Crunchy & spicy kick! Very interesting  Egg truffle sandwich $14ish - yummy and lots of flavors! I took a few bites and was almost a little overwhelmed with the truffle and eggs haha but the bf liked it and demolished his whole plate  Cinnamon biscuits-$8ish- I would give this 3/5. It was good but nothing too spectacular. The biscuit had good cinnamon flavor and they do give you a good portion of fruit which I appreciated.   Huervos M something haha my friends ordered this and they both really enjoyed it. They said it had a spicy yet sweet kick (they have bananas in it!) I didn't get to try it but they both also devoured their plates   Overall a pleasant experience, and it's nice place to be away from the strip, but nothing stood out too much to me, probably would try another brunch place next time!"}

When I arrived, I ordered an olive and grape platter and Save the Tuna for appetizers. The Olive and grape platter was different and I would simply say it is an acquired taste. I only like one cheese out of the 3 I ordered. The Save the tuna was amazing! If I had that as a whole meal I would be satisfied. For my main dish, I ordered the Russian standard. It was okay, I liked how the flavors worked together, but it was not anything special. The dessert was amazing! I ordered the brownie sundae and it tastes absolutely amazing!

Finally got around to eating here on my last trip and now I'm wondering what all the fuss was about. It's good, but nothing I had made it rise to greatness. Although, to be fair I didn't exactly order the most exciting thing on the menu.   I got eggs. Two scrambled eggs, to be exact. And they came with smoked bacon and chive potatoes and toast, which was of the rye variety. All of the above was sufficiently cooked and tasty. None of it was particularly noteworthy, though I will point out that I give props to any place serving rye bread. If they really wanted to get on my good side, they'd serve pumpernickel or squaw.   My gf ordered something called a skinny jenny which was pretty damn good. I don't know why they give it a girly, low-cal name that makes it sound like a dish catering to women. I would have ordered one, too, if it had a moniker that sounded more unisex. My eyes wandered right over it because it sounded like some health food thing tailored for girls trying to keep off the pounds."}

The potatoes were not very good either overcooked with burnt chips scattered throughout.   The Huevos was an unusual combination and probably good if you like the strange combination of flavors.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I like Eat. I like the fact that it's modern, hip, urban, and located downtown. Charm, character, and frankly, they need more places like these downtown. Just across the street from Container Park and down the street from LVA (geez, where were all these places when I was a student?!).   PARKING: There's metered parking galore for around $2 an hour during the daytime around here and DO NOT think you can get away without being fined.   PROTIP: Get a player's card at El Cortez (free; takes two minutes) and you get to park for FREE at either of the manned parking garages (located at 7th and Ogden). Even when they charge $10 parking on Fridays/Saturday nights now, it's free if you flash your card. If you suck at parallel parking like I do even for the after-6pm free street parking, then park in the garages (you don't have to worry about walking too far to get to Container Park or the Fremont East bars).   AMBIANCE: Eat. is a cute breakfast/lunch place. They're only open 8AM-3PM on weekdays and close an hour earlier on weekends. I like the decor and there's a ton of seating here for 2-4 people tables. Great use of space without feeling too cramped. There's a nice breakfast bar area near the cashier but I feel like it's a secret oh-god-please-don't-pick-to-sit-here-because-you'll-just-stare-at-us-type thing. Luckily there's another high table bar in the center that you can sit at.   Hip, casual atmosphere. Fun place to meet with friends or a semi-loud business lunch.  FOOD: I ordered the chicken sausage, and the Chicken Pot Pie (they offer it every monday) Every other day than monday, they offer a special off-menu item so be sure to ask!   I thought it was kind of funny listing free-range chicken at every mention in the menu. I wanted to ask my server for a profile of my slaughtered hen right there. You know, just to make sure it was a happy free-range chicken when it was living.   Chicken pot pie ($14ish?) was good. Nicely seasoned with the right amount of mashed potatoes, gravy (dear god the gravy), carrots, slices of moist chicken, and peas inside. The pastry encasing it was fluffy, golden, and wasn't too hard biting into it. Comes with a small side salad of mixed greens and sliced carrots. Presentation was nice! Does it blow me away for what it is flavor-wise? Nope. Delicious, yes. Very well-thought out, but not wowing. Portion was decent, but not really worth the price tag.   My chicken sausage ($5ish) side dish was okay. A bit tough, but the flavor was decent. Honey-soaked flavor. Tasted fine but not really worth the price for portion honestly.   Service was good. Checked back on us often and our server recommended the pot pie to me.   VERDICT: Overall, Eat is a few unique steps up from your average brunch place. Presentation of the food is gorgeous and the flavors are good/okay, but the price tag? Ouch. Maybe it's quality of the ingredients that justifies it. The food isn't mediocre by any means, but it's not something stunning as I'm led to believe. It's a great place to reenact scenes from Portlandia. I would definitely come back for lunch with the girlfriends. I like Eat a lot, but I'm not drinking the kool-aid just yet."}

We kept it simple (eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes), which meant we got our food quickly -- very much a plus -- but while the eggs were fresh and hot, the potatoes were obviously reheated from the day before and were soggy with oil. I didn't mind the reuse, but the poor preparation killed what would otherwise have been a tasty side. Our server was friendly and professional; a lot of people came in shortly after we did and she had to hustle to keep up, but she was as attentive as she could have been under the circumstances and we were satisfied with the quality of the service. If I'm back in the downtown area on my next trip, I might give Eat another try, but I'll probably go for a lunch item instead."}

The KGCS is on the greasy side, which I expected, but it doesn't deliver a flavor justifying the name Killer.  As for the Bánh Mì, it was just okay.  It doesn't deliver the same type of flavors that a traditional vietnamese Bánh Mi and was overall hard to eat with the overtoasted bun.    All in all, I'm going to take a pass on Eat in the future.  At its price point, I'll just go to another place with better food in the Downtown area.  I would recommend Kabob Korner, Le Thai, Aloha at the California, and/or Triple George, which all have better tasting food for the same or cheaper prices."}

I was disappointed that they have a somewhat limited bfast menu during the week (no eggs benedict) and they discontinued the beignets, which were the two things I specifically came for, thus the docked star.  The coffee was good and they have Truvia which is a def plus. I got the truffled egg sandwich, which was surprisingly bland for $12 and could have used some cheese or something for flavor. I made my own concoction of syrup and tabasco, which I know sounds completely weird, but is absolutely delicious! The chive potatoes were also a little too much on the greasy side for my liking.  The stars of the morning bfast show were the cinnamon butter strawberry compote biscuits, which were amazing if not pricey @$8 for four. Maybe it was the fresh blackberries?

It took us a second to get seated because the hostess was busy in the back grabbing and packing to go orders. There were a couple people waiting around for their to go orders. Seems to go orders are more popular than sit down. A waiter came out and said the hostess would be right with us.   We sat down and was greeted by waiter fairly quickly but he had a good amount of tables to serve as well so ordering took a little while unless he was giving us extra time since there were the five of us. It was disappointing because everything we wanted to order, they ran out of. They ran out of all red pasta sauce and after ordering they can out of the taco shells. This tells me that nothing is made fresh but rather preprepped and warmed up and difficult to substitute because it's already pre-made. But this also tells me those dishes are probably really popular and yummy because the were sold out by 7! I really wanted to impress my omnivore friends but they looked really dissatisfied with every bite they took so we felt it would be best to take care of their meal. We ordered a variety of dishes which came out to over $100. Some dishes we got may have had some good flavor but nothing to die for and nothing terrible dissatisfying. I would give this place a try if you're vegan and or gluten free and are in the area. Unless your stomach is sensitive. All five of us were gassy after our meals. Not sure if the food is old or if the black beans weren't soaked long enough or what. I personally wouldn't come back. Sorry to say. I don't regret trying it though.

Unfortunately our second meal was given to another table and about 10mins later the meal was taken from that table and given to me. They did offer to make me a fresh dish when I said I wasn't happy about eating food that had been in front of other people so long. Unfortunately this meant that my husband and I ate separately & no compensation for this was offered although the other table got to eat the free dish!  We were also told it was drinks happy hour buy one get one free but were charged for two beers. We were told this was because one person has to drink both beers. They reversed this charge when told only my husband had drunk the beers. Dessert was very disappointing. The chocolate tacos were recommended by the server and they were very tiny. More like three tiny wafer cakes. Would go back for the meatballs."}

In fact, I wonder if they got the order wrong the first time. The take out order was different too but that's always the case - take out is just different. But like I said, it was really really good. I enjoyed my food tremendously.   The staff is very nice but some are better than others. I got great service both times but I noticed other servers not refilling their patrons' drinks or taking a long time to check on them, etc. Also the hostess sat everyone in the back and I suggested that they might want to seat people by the windows so the place looks busier to people walking by - could be good for business. She defended herself by saying she was seating according to her rules, which I'm sure she was but she should have just said, Thanks for the suggestion! and smiled.   They've made a few mistakes here and there but they seem well-intentioned and I'm hoping they'll get everything straightened out. For example, the health department shut them down after inspection. But they fixed everything very quickly and they fixed it all perfectly so that the next inspection the next day found zero violations. I am hoping to review them again and give them higher marks in the future :)"}

The iced tea was very nice and the staff were courteous. It's also clean and attractive inside, metered parking outside.  I came in solo and wanted to sit near a window to enjoy the morning sun. Large windows with tables at them surrounded the dinning area. But they were tables for four and I was solo. But the whole place was 70% empty, there were 5-6 of these 'window' tables, and when I came in they were all EMPTY. All the patrons were either at the counter or crowded together in a dark pit-like seating area in the center. So despite my asking nicely they denied me a seat at the window.  I can understand saving those tables to accommodate parties of four when the place is busy, but if a customer wants to be seated at a window, you should just seat them there.  I hope the management rads this a makes some changes. It really does seem a nice place to eat, but they are shooting themselves in the foot with this seating nonsense."}

My Daughter had Mama Mia (Spaghetti and meatballs:) Tasted like tomato sauce.  Had to ask for salt and pepper to make it have any flavor at all. Service was just ok.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "After a couple of visits, I figured it was time to writ ea review. Both visits have come on weekends, where the menu is slightly different. The second visit was on a Sunday, when you don't have to dig for quarters to feed the meter.  I've now had the beignets, pancakes, Downtown Benedict (only available on the weekends) and Huevos Motulenos. All of the food has been outstanding. In fact, if I was rating this place just on the food, it probably would have been a five-star rating. The servers were competent, but nothing special. In fact, my coffee cup sat empty for long stretches on both visits.   My real issue comes down to the lack of an overall WOW that I'd expect from a Downtown Project-invested business. First, when ordering today we were informed of a new policy that forbids substitutions on the weekend. Something as simple as swapping the sausage out for bacon or asking for eggs over medium instead of eggs over easy. The server even said he didn't want to submit it because he didn't want any more demerits. Second, when we went to pay, there was a note in folio that when they are slammed they only accept one credit card when checks are being split. Both of these policies will be enough to stop the casual diner from returning. Substitutions are a reality in the restaurant business and splitting checks among multiple credit cards is also commonplace.   Finally, we did not receive a warm fuzzy from Chef Nat. She was there on both of my visits and, even though she wasn't working in the kitchen, never stopped by our table. In fact, on my most recent visit looked downright unpleasant until my wife said have a nice day.   Ultimately, the key to a great restaurant is great food and great service. They definitely have the food down. The service just needs to catch up."}

We were greeted by our server after a few and he seemed friendly enough.   We ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower Wings. This I must say was amazing. Cooked perfectly , nice and crisp. The buffalo sauce had great flavor and a good kick to it. I only wish that they gave you more than a small portion cup of ranch. Tracking down the server to ask for more was not an easy task.   Moving on to the entree I was disappointed. The Russian standard was just OK. In my opinion it was bland and the braised eggplant was rubbery. It was really a let down in comparison to the appetizer.   Like I mentioned in the beginning of the review, this place has a good concept. They just need to work on the execution, and with the chef in the kitchen.  I may try it again."}

The Service-- - The hostess was nice and sat us quickly.  - Our waiter was super friendly. He makes up for the bad experience. However, he did not check on us at all once our entrees came. Although, he was charismatic about serving us.  - The Manager: absolutely rude. Being from out of town, we stopped by Dutch Brothers for some coffee. We brought it in not thinking about it at all. Many of the waiters commented on how much they love our coffee. So when the manager came around and said You can have your coffee in here but you can't drink it, we thought he was joking and laughed. He goes on to say I'm not joking. It's a law. You can't have it in here. It is an understanding rule, but we were so put off by it because of how rude he said it. If he would have been kind and humble about it, we would have been fine with it and would have complied. Instead, he decided to be an asshole about it. He went on throughout the meal with checking on other guest but not once did he come to us.   The food was great. The hostesses and the waiter service was great. The manager...he was an asshole.

We had the Bao bun with tofu and the sauce was too strong, as if it came out of a can but it was edible.  The steamed dumplings were soggy. Next were the entrees and the African yam stew was best of the bunch.  The Russian standard with pasta tasted like regular pasta with tomato sauce. But the Vegie burger with a bean patty was so bland, even if eaten by itself.  My husband took one bite and that was it, no second try.  We also had the non-dairy pizza, which looked good but tasted like paper.  Honestly, this is the worst pizza I have ever had in my life.  Not being a vegan, I needed at least some real cheese for flavor.   Our vegan aunt  also thought that the food was subpar.  So I am giving the food 2 stars.   We had other vegetarian food during our trip and the Veggies house was excellent, so were the veggie dishes at the Bacchanal."}

First, it took 20 minutes for our order to be taken, then almost 25 minutes to get our food. We were there for 1.5 hours on our lunch break, which is 30 minutes too long.   I tried the Buffalo Cauliflower and the sauce and flavor is delicious. Unfortunately, the oil from being deep fried left my stomach so upset, that I would never order it again. The oil was pooling on the plate. I wish they would bake this dish. I make it at home and bake it. It is just as delicious and has that batter crunch, if baked right.   My friends both liked what they ordered and said each entree had good flavor. One was a bean burger and the other was the mushroom sliders.   So over all, service was lacking and my dish was edible, flavorful yet too greasy.  They enjoyed their dishes, which is wonderful as they are not vegan. They thought it was rather expensive though. I am vegan and am always looking for a great vegan/vegan friendly restaurant to try and support. Just not sure this meets the mark.   I will give it another try and try a different dish. Maybe it will be a better experience."}

We also had the Deviled Eggs (http://bit.ly/2CFVBLz) Each egg half was deep fried with panko crumbs. The yolk had small strips of bacon on the top and a bit of sriracha.

I found the flavors and consistencies to be contrasting. Black beans and peas were too hard, salsa didn't complement the dish, there was hardly any egg, the tortilla was soggy, and the bananas confused the entire dish.   The beignets were really fluffy, but they would have been better if made and served fresh. They were barely warm when they got to our table. The strawberry jam was really good, though.   The Benedict was decent. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.   The Chicken Fried Steak was definitely the best plate. The gravy was seasoned deliciously, I just wish there was more of it.

Actually we came by last Sunday morning only to find out that they were closed because they had run out of food on the day before (opening day). After doing our due diligence, we had already decided we would try again this Saturday morning and order their beignets, truffled egg sandwich, and pancakes. We were a bit disappointed when the server told us that they only served a special (more like limited) brunch menu on weekends and the truffled egg sandwich was only available M-F. Really? That's such an arbitrary limitation, but we got over it. I decided to go with the free range chicken sandwich instead.  The beignets ($8) came out first and looked great. There were 5 pieces, and they were served with a tasty homemade strawberry jam and an overly thick vanilla mascarpone. Unfortunately, these beignets are not light, flaky, and fluffy but rather dense and doughy. They are essentially little doughboys or deep fried balls of dough. Calling them beignets is a stretch.  We enjoyed the pancakes ($9) which came in a stack of 4. They had a great crispy texture along the edges and were served with a single small but tasty chicken-apple sausage. However, we did note with dismay that both the pancakes and sausage had sections that were charred completely black. I don't know about you, but I like to keep my carcinogen consumption down to a minimum.  The chicken sandwich ($12) came with a choice of homemade potato chips or potato salad. I went with the latter. For the price, we felt the portion sizes were off. The chicken sandwich was kind of small and should be at least 50% bigger while the potato salad was fairly generous. The chicken was underseasoned and sort of bland, but was ok when combined with a bite of the overly salty potato salad.  The space has a trendy downtown loft vibe. Despite the seemingly large number of servers, service was a bit slow, especially on water refills and collecting the check. We would possibly return for the pancakes and perhaps to try the seemingly elusive truffled egg sandwich. However, from a taste and value standpoint, we would pass on the beignets and chicken sandwich."}

FYI We parked at El Cortez and walked over, which the restaurant is located right behind/after The Container Park heading south on 7th.   It was about 930am and the place was relatively full so we waited about 2-5 minutes to be seated. Customer service on this end was good as the hostess greeted us immediately upon entry and as she stepped away to clear up a (or perhaps even our) table one of the waiters walking by asked us if we have been helped. I like that. The place is a lot bigger than I was anticipating it to be however it's very DT. I can understand how this place can get packed especially if there are larger parties.   Anyway we got our seats and overlooked the clipboarded menu. Our drink orders were obtained off the bat however it did take a while to get our food order. Which our waiter politely apologized for the wait. The food did take a while too but I didn't mind as it gave me the opportunity to catch up with The Newlyweds however my tummy wasn't too thrilled about that as it couldn't stop growling.   For my drink I opted for the EARL GREY SUPREME tea ($4). It's basically just a tea bag of earl grey with a side of honey, which I dumped the whole lot into my cup. Refills of hot water are allowed....as with the coffee which my girlfriend ordered.   For food I ordered the EGG TRUFFLED SANDWICH ($12). It was superb. I knew I was getting into something tasty and delicious as I could smell the aroma of my chived potatoes waiting to be devoured. I didn't need to add any hot sauce(s), which are available upon request. There were perfect amounts of scrambled egg, bacon, and  mushrooms in between slices of the warm cibatta bread.   My buddies both got the pancake stakes($9)--so typical of Newlyweds, order the same exact thing. The stack was three full/large pancakes and had a sliced chicken sausage atop it with a strawberry and powered sugar to garnish. I'm not much of a pancake girl--maybe with my makeup time to time when I'm rushing--so my review on them will be bias. It was okay. They are very popular here so feel free to order them. Both of them liked their pancakes.  [Note: we really wanted to order the beignets to share however the waiter said that they are discontinued. I know I heard discontinued. Which is a real bummer as they seemed very, very popular so I'm hoping the waiter was just misinformed or meant to say that they were not being served the morning we went. That was a real bummer. Hence the knock of a star for the rating.]  All in all I'm pretty positive that I will be back again. And I'm already thinking I'll be back with the other (Yelp/Xtian) Bestie as she's jelly that I ate here. Awaiting that CES check first!!!   It's really a 3.75 star rating if we had decimals to rate with. Would I recommend it-yes. Would I come back-probably. Would I reorder what I ate & drank-definitely the sandwich, however I'd opt out of getting tea again as I can't justify the pricing for it. Maybe I'll just get another drink. There are other options on the menu that I would like to try and maybe I could give an updated review then!   Happy eats!"}

I came here for breakfast and ordered the 2 egg breakfast which comes with bacon, potatoes, and your choice of bread. My friend decided on the golden brown pancakes.  While waiting for our food, the waiter puts down a side plate of packets of butter and 2 miniature containers of syrup. My friend and I decided to ask the owner about her choice of serving pre packaged butter and syrup. She told us it was more sanitary, they could tell how much syrup each customer used, and was more cost effective. Her answer was satisfactory until I really thought about it and my side of English muffins came out. The butter packet was on top of the English muffin and it was barely toasted and soggy. I thought to myself how many times those butter packets have been handled and how unsanitary it was sitting on top of my English muffin.   On to the two eggs breakfast I ordered and my friends golden pancakes. The breakfast was fine however, the chicken apple sausage was very greasy. My friends pancakes were tasty but also greasy and the portion was ginormous."}

WTF!..Talk about false advertising. ..Then what breakfast place worth its weight in gold doesn't serve freshly squeezed orange juice..Especially after a long night of dancing and drinking. THIS is essential. .. Small yet quait with indoor/outside seating and decent decor and ambiance but who really cares about that at breakfast. ..Good food, Freshly squeezed juice options and great service is how we judge our Breakfast  spots. Whats saves this joint is The Food...fresh ingredients and righteous spicing are key.. So if you're ok with decent service, no freshly squeezed oj but good food (without the beignets) Definitely give this place a try, at least once.."}

Industrial mixed with plants is great!! Very clean and cozy. We started with dumplings Beautiful Presentation and must eat with sauce. I like to try things alone, but with sauce WOW!! Then Bao Wow is WOW WOW I know I know SOO good!! Great mixture of Mushrooms with the tofu and again presentation awesome.   Then I had Chickn' and waffles couldn't pass it up I love the mixture of savory and sweet. There was a spicy sauce layered in with the waffles and the chicken had a light batter which makes me happy wasn't to much. There was a WHOLE potato yes. WHOLE potato cut and served with my dish crazy good. My Husband had the Mama's Red Burrito. Looked good did not try he LOVED IT!!  Finally, my son had French Toast and Orange Smoothie. He ate them both with no complaints. That is a Miracle in itself since he's a meathead!!  Haha. So yes food AMAZING!!  Now the staff.  Meh!! We had Grizellda  (I'm sure didn't spell it right). She was nice but I felt like nothing above and beyond.Just to greet us it took her at least 10 minutes. Yes I timed her. She was attending One other table Really!!  The least you can do is introduce yourself and say you'll be right with us. I understand the industry I was in food service, retail, and now beauty. I get people.  She was more concerned talking amongst the other employees than to take the time. Also, if you pass the table I'm sitting at and you stare at me maybe you should smile. ( I'm referring the the rest of the staff) It doesn't hurt. I mean I'm smiling,  it isn't hard to reciprocate. So, overall I will go back and just get the to-go or maybe try a different shift."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Very interesting and bacon-centric menu. I had the beignets and my gf the 2 egg omelet. The the homemade jam and vanilla marscapone that came with the beignets were excellent. The outer bite and inner fluffiness was just right, but the flavor a little off. The eggs were cooked really nice and creamy, the potatoes nicely caramelized and the bacon crispy. She liked a lot. But thought it was weird that everything had the same seasoning.  We sat. At the bar so we could get a seat without wait and see them cook. I don't eat meat, so this is always fun to see how vegetarian-friendly a place is. Eat does not claim to be and they are not. The beignets were cooked with the chicken-fried chicken. That's where the off-flavor came from. Who cooks sweet and savory together? We watched as potatoes and pancakes were cooked in the bacon grease, making those not vegetarian options. It was also weird that the chicken-fried chicken was pre-cooked. They pull a Saran wrapped cooked cutlet from the fridge and drop in in the oil to twice-cook it. Maybe that's their thing, but people loved it. We also watched as almost everything sent out got a got couple shakes of some salt seasoning. I tried a taste of the eggs and the seasoning was good, just my gf didn't think it needed to be on everything.  Overall, good for meat-eaters, bad for veg. Even if it looks veg on the menu."}

It really wasn't that good as I expected seems like any other regular place. Maybe I went in expecting a lot. Overall it was okay but not worth going again."}

I'm allergic to almonds and walnuts and they're ingredients weren't listed, just had pictures of nuts next to items that contained nuts.

After being pulled in by the breakfast options we decided to order the waffles. Our server then told us breakfast wasn't being served at the time & we shouldn't have been given that menu. Seems like an opening week mistake not something that should be happening at this point.   We decided on the bao which was the best thing we tried. Highly recommend. The black bean quesadilla was tasty but not anything to write home about. The jackfruit tacos were not my cup of tea but others in my group dug them. The big haus salad was very good & filling but I could probably make something like it at home.   I don't like that they put the term meat balls on their menu. At least put it in quotes, meat balls, so people can easily understand it isn't meat nor are there meat options. Many people know everything is plant based here but perhaps those discovering this place on a whim may not.   I would still like to come back for the breakfast offerings."}

It seems that the shrimps were defrosted, but not all the way. It was gross. I don't think the shrimp and grits would've been that bad if the shrimps were fresh. The shrimps is what killed it for me. Overall, the dish is a 2 out of 5.  The pancakes, however, is a 5 out of 5. They're the BOMB(dot)COM. If you're going to eat., get the PANCAKES. Screw the shrimp and grits. The pancakes are worth the drive.  I guess another aspect I didn't like about eat., is that I felt rushed eating. They seemed eager for us to finish our meal, which killed the experience."}

We arrived around 1:30 pm and were seated immediately. We both ordered the veggie burger, which we received less than 5 minutes after placing our orders. Had it been a cold dish, it wouldn't have bothered me as much. Was it microwaved?  I am no stranger to veggie burgers, but when the waiter set my plate in front of me I was a bit taken aback. The patty was red! I was also a little confused as to why we only received 4 french fries and a mound a ketchup. After about 3 minutes of mental preparation, i finally took a bite of the burger. It was actually decent. Not nearly as good as my favorite veggie burger from Lucille's, but it was tasty. There was a ton of flavor is the patty, and the burger was dressed with extra goodness. The consistency of the patty was off. I think the ingredient were precooked, chilled and free formed. The texture reminded me of baby food. The fries.. there weren't enough for me to to review, but I will give them an honorable mention.  The chef came out and asked us home the meal was, which was a lovely touch. The service was excellent. I would probably go back if I was with another Vegan."}

Concrete floors and cinder block walls made it a noisy restaurant while busy.  Unfortunately, this eatery wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  The food is okay, but nothing special.  Two of us had shrimp and grits... It was okay, but didn't wow us.  There was a nice quantity of shrimp in the serving.  Another person ordered the egg truffle sandwich.  It was a large sandwich.  She said it was good but not something she'd go out of her way for.    The potatoes that come with the egg truffle sandwich had an odd taste, almost like they were tossed in rancid oil first.  My friend has a complicated palate and said perhaps they were seasoned with truffle oil...  I don't know but I would not order them.    We ordered regular coffee and it had an unusual flavor as well.    The parking is limited to metered street parking.

We got everything we needed but there was no explanation of the menu of suggestions or conversation at all.   The menu had a grilled cheese with tomato soup. I asked to substitute the green chicken chile pozole instead.   She said that would be A-OK for a $1 up charge. She also offered avocado and bacon on my sandwich. Of course! By no means did I expect this to be a free addition; however, it turned out to be a $6 charge which made my grilled cheese and soup somewhere in the neighborhood of $16. Yowsa. It was delightful. The sourdough bread was giant, no less than 1 thick for each slice. It was soaked 3/4 of the way through with butter. The sandwich was crispy, chewy, yummy and decadent. The pozole was spicy, and very flavorful. Loads of veggies and shredded chicken. Very good. I shared it with my little guy and still had leftovers to take home. It was a generous portion.   My compadres enjoyed their arugula salad and chicken sandwich very much. We all drank water. The bill was $45 for 2 sandwiches and a salad. So $18 each for lunch. I guess not bad.

Aside from the food, the place had a positive atmosphere and the service was great. The only downfall to the service was towards the end when we were all ready to pay. We pulled out our cards and placed them on the table, only to have the owner walk up and say Can you pay with one card?, abruptly leaving and then coming back with a receipt paper that had only one payment per table written on it and harshly walked away again without saying anything. I felt this was very unprofessional and rude especially coming from the owner. The payment rule, I feel, is such an inconvenience to the customer since everyone splits checks now a days. Putting up a sign or having the severs mention the payment rule would be great for the customers and restaurant to avoid any problems.

I have never been to a vegan or vegetarian restaurant so it was interesting for me to see the options they had. Located next to Glutton and fairly easy to find.  Walking in, we were greeted and promptly seated by a friendly staff. I love the interior because it went well with the concept. Lots of living plant which added to the clean and refreshing vibe.  Keep in mind, I am not a vegan or vegetarian by any means so based on my diet and the things I eat on a daily basis, everything here tasted bland. I don't know if the fact that I am not a vegan/vegetarian plays a role in this but just wanted to quickly mention.   Save the tuna ($6.95): One of the appetizer. My favorite dish out of everything. It's a vegan sushi with avocado and mango (?). Texture was similar to tuna and it was presented beautifully. Highly recommend. 5/5  Mushroom madness/picante pineapple ($10.95): They have three different pizza options and you can get half and half which is what we did. Unfortunately I did not try picante pineapple because of jalapenos and I can't handle any heat. Mushroom madness is assorted mushrooms with herbs. It was on a thin crust and I definitely did not like the tomato sauce they used. It had a weird sweetness/tanginess to it. 3/5  Chicken pot pie: Not the pot pie I expected. There was no crust or pastry bowl, it was just a chicken stew. It had a light curry flavor but overall tasted bland. For some reason stew felt grainy and I was not a fan of its flavor nor the texture. 2/5  One of those first and last visit. Nothing memorable about the visit except for their hip and cool ambiance. I don't think I will be back."}

I had a basic breakfast of bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast with coffee.  I just love a simple breakfast and the eggs tasted great but the bacon was too crisp and the potatoes seemed dry and this may have something to do with it being a heated up plate, sure I got a warning but I don't really see this as a great sign to begin a meal.  The hostess was nice and the greeting from the waiter was prompt but after that it seemed to fall off as I was served without given any condiments until I flagged someone and asked for them, and I never got a refill on my coffee.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Ok I am kind of, a fan.. so far. I often do not rate a place until I have been at least a couple of times but, this review is based on a 1-time visit, and one take-out order. I had the same thing both times, as the take-out order was a surprise and happened to be the same exact thing I had - to an extent.   Both times I had the, now famous, SAVE THE TUNA - non sushi roll. With Forbidden Rice on the outside and various fruits and vegetables on the inside. The most recent visit had mango, avocado, and perhaps a carrot puree? I would have liked an explanation of what I was eating , as the very simple description on the menu states - 'Vegan Sushi - Forbidden Rice'. Which I take to mean that the ingriedients are seasonal or daily fresh items. So that's cool.. but something like that REALLY deserves a bit of explanation When being presented. The server was all over the restaurant as I think perhaps they were on low-staff situation. I dunno.. but I couldn't get a chance to ask her what I was eating. In any even - it was sort of good.    I also had the 'Mushroom Madness' Pizza - which I have had previously. I really like mushrooms and so that is a no brainer when I am at a loss of what to eat. This visit, I was very hungry so the server suggest that I try two types of pizza on each half. So I did that, and asked her to choose what ever else she thought would be good. She chose the 'Picante Pineapple' as the second half of the pizza. It consisted of 'charred pineapple, jalapenos, and 'sausage crumbles'. Its all vegan so it's obviously not real sausage and was remenicent of chorizo in flavor.    The chorizo-like sausage crumbles weren't too hot on the palate, but man, did it burn my chest for the next couple of hours. So I'll skip that next time. Whatever was used to season the 'sausage', really gave me some terrible heartburn. As I said, I really liked the mushroom pizza though, and would possibly get that again.   It was semi-filling, and I did not leave hungry.. I will say that I was a little bit dissapointed at the presentation of the sushi roll. It was a bit of a 'womp-womp' as it arrived on the table... It was colorful and good but loooked a bit deflated. I don't say that to be mean.. but you can sort of tell what I mean by the pic I posted.   Anyway, I may go back and try other things and then go from there.. we shall see... so.. HAPPY EATING TO YOU!"}

I got Shrimp and Grits, the presentation was awesome but the food lacked flavor, the shrimp were medium sized and the grits were awful, clumpy and tasted instant. For the price ... My expectations were much, much higher.  My friend got the hash and again looked nice but once you dug in... All you got was very expensive fried potatoes. Not sure I will give them another chance.. Their prices are just to high to get average food."}

Cute little area with an open kitchen. Service was good, maybe too good cause my server and a few others kept checking up on me every 5 minutes which was annoying. It was just myself so they probably thought I was the health inspector, food critic, or some shit like that. Lol.  Anyway, asked my server what was the best seller, she said the Truffle Egg Sandwich. 5 minutes later she came out with my food. THE FOOD WAS COLD! Every thing was not fresh to order. Wanted to say something, but I was too hungry to even bother. The sandwich was eh. Truffle oil wasn't over powering. Wish the bread was toasted more. And the feta added an additional flavor. Potatoes were bland. Not a lot of seasoning to them. The onions in them were burnt, and the strawberry on the side was an unnecessary garnish though."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I was working downtown when Eat opened its doors, and it's still one of my go-to places whenever I'm looking for a place to eat. If I could give it another half-star I probably would, but there are a few things that I have to consider:  Pros: awesome coffee in the mornings, nice atmosphere and decor, great homemade chips, delicious grilled-cheese sandwich, and a freaking amazing tofu banh mi (seriously...that was one of my favorite things there).  Cons: the spicy posole was disappointingly bland to my palette (perhaps an off-day?), the breakfast dish with the tortilla chips (name of which is escaping me and apparently the website is down so I can't check) was tasty but ultimately muddled in flavor.  Probably the most frustrating thing (and the one that still sticks in my craw) was the day I grabbed a salad to go. I got the spinach salad with aspragus and almonds, and decided to add some shrimp. I saw that the shrimp add-on was kind of spendy (~$4), and ultimately the salad cost me $18. When I got to the office I was disappointed to find a tiny salad and three tiny shrimp. That's more than $1/shrimp!   So yeah...ultimately, I like the food, I have my favorites, but I can't round up to 4 stars just yet. When I start working downtown again that may change (and I'll definitely go back), but being away from the area has taken the shine off my initial experiences."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Not sure how eat. garnered all this hype, but it's a solidly mediocre New American spot. The concept and the space resonate with me, but the devil is in the details and the execution just isn't there.   For starters - the service is not there. Neither our hostess nor our waiter were particularly warm or accommodating. Our table didn't have any silverware - not even after our coffees were served. We instead had to ask for them as our food was coming out. We noticed this happened with a bunch of other tables as well. The waiter just couldn't be bothered to do anything beyond the bare minimum necessary.   As for the food - the food was decent. The truffled egg sandwich that everyone raves about was a-ok for an egg sandwich in my book (a $12 egg sandwich btw). I was most excited about the mushrooms and truffle flavors - but it was disappointingly light on the mushrooms and the truffles. I maybe caught only one bite that had a hint of truffles. The sandwich also comes on a giant toasted ciabbata roll that wasn't sliced - a minor detail, but those details adds up.   The cinnamon biscuit with strawberry compote was decent - the biscuit is more like a toasted chunk of cinnamon bread. Not particularly buttery or hard on the outside like a true biscuit. The strawberry compote was good - it came with some fresh strawberries and blackberries. Another minor detail- but the leaves weren't removed from the strawberries. The color of the tiny leaves didn't add anything aesthetically - and needing to remove them just became a bit of a pain in the butt.  I'm impressed by how far downtown Vegas has come. Eat. is a good choice if you're looking for generally reliable, slightly more hipster brunch food - but given all the options in Vegas, eat. wouldn't be my first choice."}

After a disappointing experience with Roast Beef my first visit, I returned with my Dad, Stepmom and Stepsister, discriminating, if somewhat cynical diners.  Chef Natalie Young was at the door and greated us less than enthusiastically, I might even say grumpily.  Second visit I got that impression from her.  Although she said she wouldn't turn down the music, it did get turned down for a while.  I had the fried chicken, grits, collard greens and mac and cheese special, my guests had the grilled cheese and a chicken sandwich.  Our waitress was friendly with a sense of humor which certainly helped.  The fried chicken was excellent and I would have it again if they offer it.  I did not like the collard greens as they tasted dirty but the grits and mac were wonderful.  My guests enjoyed their dishes as well.  On the way out Chef Young actually gave us a smile and a thank you!  A few things keep this restaurant from getting higher ratings.  1) Breakfast ends at 11.  This isn't a problem for me but we arrived at 10 minutes before 11 were handed a breakfast menu, and then, when the waitress showed up 15 minutes later, she said we couldn't order any breakfast items, even the berries which doesn't involve any breakfast cooking.  You think they would have at least allowed us some berries.  2) They have no desserts.  The waitress apologized and half heartedly offered us some breakfast muffins (even though it was after 11) but this place would rock if they had some deserts.  Next time I will try the breakfast which other reviewers rave about."}

A restaraunt with quality food downtown that I don't have to walk through a casino to get through that isn't Le Thai (mad love) or Chicago Joe's (even madder love) or a bar? Yes, please!  Today was finally the day.   We arrived at 11:45 on a cold and windy Friday, and the place was already hopping. We were seated right away, and our drink orders were taken right away, as well. Hot tea on the table in 3 minutes? NICE! $4 for a cup of tea? WHAT?   The place was crowded, and while we both liked the look of the space, it was so freaking noisy. We teased that it was like being at a night club, yelling at the table to one another. As we were there to also do some business - this was annoying.   We looked over the menu and decided on our lunch. I really wanted the chicken pot pie, but was told it would be at least a 20 minute wait for that. Yeah. Not enough time for that nonsense, at all. I decided on the roast beef sandwich ($13? This better be good!) and a cup of the tomato soup instead of the potatoes. She said there would be a slight up charge. Cool. No problem. I'm thinking it would be - you know - an upcharge. Since I'm not getting the side that comes with it - just the soup. Nope. I didn't get the side, that I paid for, but I did get the cup of soup at the regular $4 price. Not happy. My lunch? $21.   My friend ordered a diet coke and the Shrimp Po Boy with potato salad. His lunch? $19.  The food took almost 20 minutes to come out. Um. I coulda got the pot pie.  The roast beef sandwich was big, with a good portion of yummy, tender medium rare roast beef and super yummy pickled red onions. It really wasn't anything extraordinary though. And for $13, I kind of wanted extraordinary. The tomato soup was AMAZING, and I regretted not trying their grilled cheese sandwich that came with a cup of the stuff, which would have been more reasonably priced.   Friend said his shrimp po boy was ok, too much vinegar, and he said the same about the potato salad.   The service was a little bit on the slow side, but not bad.   The bill came for the 2 of us, $40. For lunch. Downtown.   It was just ok. $40 plus tip is too much money for just ok for lunch."}

It's adorable inside; industrial like feel with wood and metal pieces and an awesome wall of green. The hostess greeted us and said she will be right with us. I then noticed that she was playing buser as well as we waited. We were a party of 5 and didn't want to sit at the high tops because of my grandfather so we were okay with waiting for a larger table.

Our server, Letitia, I believe was her name, was AWESOME! She was full of life, energy and humor! She came to get our orders and was disappointed to find out by 11:30 the jackfruit tacos were sold out! I don't have a background in food purchasing but would hope people see trends in particular orders and would stock it accordingly. I was disappointed but moved on to my second choice Ellen Tacos. Food came out as it was ready, starting with the dumplings. This hostess was an all in one, she was now bringing out our food which she spilt soy sauce all over the table. It was clear that this establishment was extremely understaffed. I even got up to get the table 5 sets of silverware!  The food though was okay! The tacos had a lot of flavoring and crunch. The mixture was a blend of nuts. If you have consistency phobia I recommend staying away. It was almost like a tuna fish texture to a sense. But my absolute favorite was the sweet potato quesadilla! It's that sweeter option entry as to why I was only able to eat it as an appetizer.

Torn between the shrimp and grits or the truffled egg sando, I opted for the former and was only half-satisfied with my order, but by the time I got my food I was too hungry to complain. Grits were okay, bacon was crispy and added both flavor and texture, eggs were cooked perfectly, but shrimp were small and overcooked- should have been blackened, not precooked and tossed on like an afterthought. They lacked flavor and the pico was the most stand-out element of the dish, and there wasn't much of it.  I'm not generally a fan of community tables, though they're not much different than sitting at the bar- but I did make friends with the super-sweet couple who dined beside me.

Restaurant was decorated very well - industrial chic with fresh vibrant colors.  Location was in a good spot in the heart of Fremont East downtown.  The food I'd give it just an OK rating.  Had pancakes, which you cant really screw those up.  They were good.  The chicken or turkey sausage on top was a bit odd tasting.  I covered in ketchup to be able to eat.  We also ordered the Grilled Cheese with tomato soup - that was the surprising dish.  I expected so much more.  The cheese was dry and hard.  The amount of bread was overwhelming - way too much.  The soup was no better than what would come from a can.  Almost flavorless.  I can make better grilled cheese at home and Bar + Bistro has to die for tomato soup.    I think overall, the food had an off day.  I'd go back and try some other things just because of ambiance and location and I like to give em' a 2nd try."}

I have had awesome grilled cheese in my time this was not one of them. The Texas toast was a bit greasy and was overstuffed with cheese. It was almost inedible. The soup was ok not great. We won't be back."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Eat is a solid, three star brunch joint. I enjoyed my meal here.  It's a mostly good spot.  Anyone reading this seeing 3 stars and thinking it's a bad review, it's not! But there were several issues during our meal that made this place miss the 4 star level.  One place they excel: the pancake. It's thick and fluffy, while still being crispy on the outside. I rarely order pancakes, but after two bites, I was hooked.  The homemade tomato soup was quite good, with large, thin chunks or parmesan floating on top. Also, the coffee served here is excellent.  We also tried the truffled egg sandwich. I've seen other reviewers rave about this, but something was missing. The bread wasn't good, and the flavors of the ingredients didn't meld well together.   The service here was lacking.  It seems to be focused on turnover rather than true customer interaction. Our server asked us about five times if we were ready to order.  Once we were finished, three different people asked if we wanted the check.  We weren't checked on a single time while dining.   Lastly, the name is kind of dumb: Hey, you want to go eat?  Sure, what are you thinking? How about eat? ....I know, like, what place No...the restaurant in downtown called eat, silly ...   Bottom Line: A fine brunch/lunch spot, and certainly better than a lot of other Las Vegas spot. They serve brunch daily, which is really nice if you are visiting and everyday seems like a Saturday.  Maybe I went on an off day, but this place is already good and has potential to get better."}

The Grilled Cheese was probably the best thing I had--the bread was high quality and it was fairly tasty. Unfortunately, it came paired with kick ass tomato soup, and that was truly middling. Not only was it not good by itself, but dipping the grilled cheese/bread in it didn't help either. The Shrimp & Grits were downright not good, and I'd recommend strongly against ordering them."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Came to try this place out after reading good yelp reviews during our visit to Las Vegas. We came from San Diego for a family trip.   Service: This is where they lost 2 stars. Very first strike was when we arrived and asked for a table for 5 adults and 1 WHEELCHAIR. The hostess at the front responded Why don't you put her in a high chair?? Are you freakin kidding me?! Our response: You're going to put my grandmother in a high chair??! She apologized and said she was thinking we brought a child. Regardless if it is a child or adult, if we ask for ADA compliance, that's what we should get. She was insensitive and her comment made her seem like a complete idiot. Here is some advice for that hostess: Listen to UNDERSTAND, not listen to respond. Maybe you wouldn't come off as so incompetent. I really wish I got her name. Second strike was our server, Gary. Granted, we are a large party (6 people) and it was a busy morning. But we would appreciate if you don't come up to us and talk to us like we didn't know English. There's a difference between talking clearly and concise and talking like an asshole. Learn the difference.   Honestly, all the OTHER servicers, expediters, and bussers were extremely polite and friendly. They worked quickly and were very attentive. Just a couple rotten apples in the batch.   Location: Easy to find with GPS and the large sign out front makes it easy to spot. Right across the street from the Las Vegas Container Park. Near Fremont Street.  Parking: Street parking. $2 per hour, plan accordingly. Good thing is they do it in 30 minute increments.   Wait: We were quoted 15 minutes upon checking in and waited about 30 minutes. But they have a larger waiting area inside and a bench outside.   Food: Food was exceptional. We waited probably only 10 minutes for our food to be brought out. Our food was cooked really well and nothing was missing from our order. Coffee is good and a good portion. Our food portions were large but not obnoxiously large."}

As we came in, it was very busy which to me, was a good sign. However the reason we couldn't get seated (even when there was available seats) was because they said they were backed up. So after 15 min we were seated and literally waited 20 mins for our appetizers and 30 more min for our other main courses. We got here at 2:30pm and didn't finish up until 4pm with our final meals. The quality of food is awesome, however it was not worth an hour and a half wait. I will try you guys again in a few months, I know this place is new so maybe some kinks need to be worked out.

The truffled eggs had little truffle flavor, and there was an overload of chive potatoes which weren't crispy. Food came out super fast though and portions are massive.

The decor is spot on, with wooden accents and a green garden wall. The menu is concise and so very visually appealing. Everything is picture perfect.  Unfortunately, picture perfect doesn't cut it for me. I have two main gripes with this place:  1) The menu items are slightly overpriced for what you get. Not so much that it's outrageous, but just enough to make you wonder why that pasta dish wasn't the best pasta dish you've had all year.  2) The dishes were all wonderfully creative and beautifully presented, but every single one was missing something. They were good but just not very special.   Here's a rundown of what we got:  Downtown Tony (portobello mushroom sliders with a side of potato wedges and sriracha aioli) - mushroom flavored/cooked well, potato wedges ok, aioli pretty good, buns left something to be desired  Gotta Get Over the Hemp - tasted very average, sauce was good but nothing too special, pasta cooked well  Chocolate Tacos - salted caramel tasted weird, taco shell tasted so stale that at one point I thought I was consuming plastic, the cinnamon(?) and coconut did not compliment the chocolate or berries at all  Jamaican Hibiscus Punch - tart, slightly sweet, salty, spicy, and watered down. At least there were free refills?  I'll come back and try Vegenation again, but for now, it is just too expensive for the amount and flavor you get."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This place is somewhere NOT to take your omnivore friends trying to convince them that being vegan is cheap LOL.  To be perfectly honest, when I had watched some vlogs or reviews of this restaurant on social media or youtube I had really high expectations for the food. Vloggers really overhyped this restaurant, possibly for more exposure. We visited on Sunday June 25th, lovely atmosphere, great sounding live acoustic guitar singer, air conditioning, and really clean! The restaurant was not too busy, and service was good.  I was craving desserts and wanted to try the tamales so here are some concise reviews on the various items my family and I tried...  Tamales 3.5/5, Amazing but pricey..for two micro-mini tamales. Came nice and warm, yummy masa, reminded me of meat tamales I used to have! Would recommend if you miss tamales!  Black bean hummus and chips 5/5, Yummy! Try this because it is so tasty! More chips please!  Blueberry Cheesecake 1/5, Ehhh, aesthetically pleasing nevertheless it was ehh and gritty.   Carrot cake 000000/5, No. Pretty, but NO. I am not totally sure if this was supposed to be a raw vegan carrot cake, but being frank, it was pretty much just the carrot grinds that were a result of juiced carrots, put together in a small cake form with cinnamon to resemble a carrot cake. Cashew creme frosting was ehh, gritty though. Expensive for not reason. Gag worthy...  Tiramisu 3/5. Yummy cause it had notes of coffee. I added some of my cold brew to it and it made it a 4/5 hahahha, would recommend adding more chocolate and coffee to this though. I enjoyed this!  I also had a black cold brew (Free refills), which was really excellent and perfectly strong AND kept me hyped all day!  If you are vegan or a curious omnivore in the Vegas area I would say give it a go, try it out. Most likely going to skip this on my next vegas visit. But, it was a good experience."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Excellent service. Alex is beautiful, kind, attentive and efficient - she is the Best! The three stars are because though the food is fresh and made with pride and care it was not something that suited my paler and tastes very much.  For my tastes I found the steamed dumplings appetizer rather bland and characterless the only taste coming from the dipping sauce. I also had the Fruit Loops salad which which, while very fresh, had a smaller proportion/ratio of grilled fruit to greens than I would have liked. It also had very little dressing for my taste. For dessert I had the Brownie Sundae which had decent vanilla ice cream, not good (to my taste) chocolate ice cream and very plane/ordinary tasting brownie. It would have helped if the brownie was heated which it was not. One more reason for the three stars is that though they advertise that they make cold pressed juices they DO NOT offer any fresh squeezed juices without alcohol so if you want any fresh juices you are forced to order one of their cocktails! I got their version of a Pina Colada and was not pleased with the way it tasted. I must say that the veggie burger the lady next to me was having looked good, how good it tasted I do not know."}

Our server was super sweet and despite the hustle and bustle, we were well attended and she always made sure our coffee was full. Cute restaurant and all, but the food just wasn't quite there. In addition, the chef looked super stressed out and unhappy being there, which seemed like it made the rest of the staff unhappy.

They seated us at the edge of the room where the entire wall is partially open to the bitter cold outside (so your head is warm, but your legs are freezing). Although there were heat lamps, the walls were just counter-intuitive.  I ordered the vegan curry, which I was very excited to see on the menu, AND with an option of chicken, beef, pork, or tofu. Now of course, I assumed this would be VEGAN, FAUX chicken/beef/pork, because why in the world would someone offer REAL MEAT with VEGAN curry?? Especially since I explicitly told the waitress that I didn't eat meat. So I ordered the vegan curry- chicken. Although my friend didn't like it, I thought the curry tasted fine.. until I started chewing on the meat which tasted like blood/iron and sinew so I asked the waitress who, only AFTER I ordered and tried it, let me know that it's NOT vegan. All four of us at the table were completely dumbfounded as to why anyone would offer Vegan Curry on the menu to have non-vegan meat in it?? And to not even be clear about that?? And when the waitress was told that the particular customer doesn't eat meat?? IMAGINE THAT. I don't get disturbed easily, but I was very disturbed after biting into flesh after being vegetarian for 7 years. That was $13 down the drain for me. I'm grudgingly giving 3 stars because my friends did enjoy their beef fried rice, and maybe the waitress had a long day. But all in all, what a ridiculously counter-intuitive place."}

I told him it's fine and we put in our order and went to the bar next door which was actually really cute and I loved the atmosphere. We got back to our hotel room and the food was piping hot which was nice. The spring rolls were really yummy, the chicken pad Thai ordered at a level 2 was too spicy for my and besides the spice it didn't have much flavor, the noodles looked whiteish and I remember it being more red last time so that was a super disappointment. The short rib fried rice was actually really good and they use real short rib meat it was super yummy. My husband liked the pad Thai and I liked the rice. The food is good but probably not the best Thai I have ever eaten. The reason for the three stars is the management needs to get their staff on a better program for wait times and maybe teach them a thing or two about customer service.

I give it 3 stars because the decor is bad, food is average, the host was confusing, Thai tea was way off, they took too long to deliver our food, and prices are too expensive in relation to quality, I got a spice level of 4 out of 5 and it wasn't even spicy at all-I had to add my own spices. You are paying for location! We had Pad Thai and Ka Pow w/ chicken and it was just OK. The best thing about this place was the free spicy peanuts."}

Met up with a few friends to this small but apparently very popular thai restaurant next to Commonwealth (the new hot bar in downtown Vegas) and The Griffin. We got a table fairly quickly ordered drinks and food, which both came fast. The hostess was a cold cold girl who seemingly had little love of life. Waiter was nice guy. Food was solid. Nothing to write home about but what do you expect in a fun thai place like that?  Things got a bit interesting when 6 others associated with our group wanted to join and take over the table next to us. Unfortunately there was a line. The awful, ostentatious girl sitting next to me who frequented the toilet several times during our meal offered to pay the bill of the large table next to us if they got up immediately and gave the table to her friends that had arrived. The level of excess in this one was beyond what I had seen and that is saying a lot. Obviously this resulted in a back and forth with the dragon lady, our waiter, and this spoiled brat who was used to getting everything her way. I was embarrassed to be associated. She did eventually get her wish. My friend and I wanted nothing to do with these people so quickly got the bill. I am not fully sure, but I am fairly confident that our waiter stole one the twenties I put on the pill and acted as if I had only put one twenty in the check. Again cannot prove it but I know that I put two down (my friend can verify). Oh well.   Overall mixed experience but is a fun place in a good location if you are going out downtown."}

When we arrived I checked in to make sure they received the reservation and they did so my friend and I walked around a bit to waste time and check out Downtown Vegas.  We ended up waiting at least an additional hour on top of what the Yelp wait time said so that was very disappointing. When we finally sat down our waiter was nice and the food was tasty. Although the drinks were watered down so I would skip that in the future.    I wouldn't go back for dinner due to the wait time but I would check it out for lunch and hope for a better outcome."}

Coming right before the Life is Beautiful Festival began, my friend and I stopped by around noon on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get bar seats.  The place isn't huge but has a small outdoor patio area as well as tables and a few bar seats.  A full bar awaited as well with a great selection of various Thai-inspired cocktails and Asian beers/wines.    So for the taste.  Drinks-wise, we both got the Spiked Thai Iced Tea which I thought was clever.  Taste-wise, I was a little more disappointed as the whiskey I believe overpowered the totality of the Thai Iced tea here.  Maybe it needed more of the Thai Iced Tea but the balance was a bit off.    Food-wise, they have a bunch of normal Thai dishes like the papaya salads and yellow curry.  I got the awesome flat noodle (which reminded me most of the pad see ewe mixed with the pad thai type of ingredients).  It came with a choice of protein (I got chicken) and the end taste was okay.  It wasn't too different from most Thai joints and I had to add a lot of spices to get it up to what I did want.  (They did also ask for a level of 1-5 spicy level which isn't always common in Thai restaurants).  The best thing I did have was the roti omlette dessert which was absolutely delicious.  Filled with nutella and a fried egg on top of a bread on the bottom, it was a solid dessert.    Service-wise, everyone was really nice and accommodating, even with all the busy atmosphere.    Venue-wise, I loved the look and atmosphere of the place.  It had a very silly take on Thai food that wasn't too serious and liked the interplay.     Cost-wise, it was very affordable with the check only about $20 per person in the end.    Again, Le Thai was pretty cool (more of a 3 1/2 stars) but taste-wise, I wasn't fully convinced in my first visit.  Hope to come back and try it again and be proven wrong in the near future."}

O yea .. their service sucks. On a non busy day we waited to be serve for a wile and the table next to us seem to have the same problem. We had an extra chair and we move it to the back with the other extra chairs there which the guy who takes the trash out felted was on his way to pass every 5min to throw way one box , or two each time. Of course giving us a stinky eye every time. We wanted to ask the lady who was going   To take our order something about the menu, we ask ! Excuse me ! She turn acknowledged and keep walking. Rude!! Then we place our order and rolling her eyes to any question she serve the wrong meat on one plate and specifically forgot to add the noodles to the one soup she suggested we add them ..!! Wait what !!   O well at lest the food was good ( not the soup) and the bathroom smelled great."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "The food here is good. We ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp. Lots of meat and shrimp in the dish. Tastes were to me, just average.   The Thai iced tea isn't overly sweet. Good and cold.   The fried bananas are good. It's wrapped in a spring roll type wrapper, fried, has banana syrup drizzled on top and dusted with powdered sugar. The banana is mushy, but a good mushy.   I'd try this place again if I'm in the mood for Thai while in Vegas."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I was in Vegas for another trip and my girlfriend and I couldn't wait to get thai food again at le Thai because our first experience was fairly good.  I can't say it was the same this time around.  The papaya salad was on the sweeter side and didn't taste like the Thai/laos style especially from the first time we had it here.  The pad sea ew with beef was terrible.  It was definitely not what we remember tasting last time.  The noodles tasted burnt and when I told the waitress she said it was normal and that the taste is more on the smoky side.  We have had their pad sea ew and many other pad sea ews and we have never had it taste smoky to where it tasted burnt.  It was very disappointing.  Service was also lackluster too.  Probably will not come here again."}

The group sat outside under cabanas with water mist spraying out, but it was still 110 degrees weather, so it didn't help much. At least the background instrumentals were dope.  The food was pretty good. I got the yellow curry mild cause I'm a pussy with spicy food. Portions - at least for the curry dish - were large enough for two meals. For the price, I'd come back if I was craving Thai food and in the area."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "A friend of mine suggested this place for dinner one night.  We had a group of 8 or 9 and this place is really really small.  Luckily they have a nice patio area with heat lamps so they set us up outside.  The food was OK...not the best Thai I'd ever had and I feel that was the general opinion of the group.  It was a bit pricey for what it was and where it was located though.  I would go back in a group setting if other people wanted to go but Vegas has way too many good restaurants to eat a place that is just OK."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Its a good place to hang out with friends late night. It's a small trendy restaurant with full bar. There are not many items on their menu. I ordered beef and meat ball noodle soup for my fiance and Thai style garlic fried rice for myself with spicy level 5. Food was average but really spicy. I didn't expect such heat from American Thai restaurant. To me, this place is more like a bar restaurant. It's nothing to compare with Lotus of Siam."}

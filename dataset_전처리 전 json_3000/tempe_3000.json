The taste was perfect and it had the right texture color and consistency. This is not a vegi garden burger. I love to cook and have no idea how they do this. Just try it and you will be shocked! I opted to remove the middle bun and it was just like a double patty with cheese and toppings. I would never have guessed it was vegan. MUST TRY! The fries were crispy and fresh. I also loved the samosas...much better than my fav indian restaurants...not greesy at all but very crispy!"}

The fact that you can go to a restaurant and not ask your server if what you order is vegetarian friendly is a dream come true!  I go to Green when I am craving vegetarian comfort food.  The spicy buffalo wings and vegan chili fries are a good way to kick that craving.   The no harm chicken parm sandwich is so tasty but watch out it is messy!

It is the perfect amount of spice for me, not too spicy but just enough to give it flavor. The chicken is so good and flavorful. If I didn't know it wasn't real chicken I would have been fooled. Their oatmeal cream pie just the right finish to the meal.   The way the restaurant is decorated is so different than most places around Tempe. All along the back wall they have old car doors lining the bottom half. On other walls, they have local astists display their artwork that you can buy. It's just a great atmosphere."}

You're bound to get lucky, at the very least because positive karma will be catching up with you for not supporting any of the evil industries.   Original review:   I love this place. I went twice yesterday. I seriously cannot get enough. As a transitioning vegetarian/vegan, the food here is a dream come true. Everything I've had is amazing. Very tasty. The chocolate and organic peanut butter tsoynami is the best dessert I think I've ever had, vegan or not. But what the fuck is up with the temperature in that place? Vegans like a temperate place to eat as much as anyone. I can't eat in there. It's so hot. I have to get my food to go or only eat there in the winter. I just don't get it. Aren't the employees uncomfortable? How could I be the only one this bothers? That's a wrap is similarly uncomfortable, but more tolerable.

Green uses organic ingredients whenever possible as stated on their menu. This place is pretty much a vegan's guilty pleasure.   Orecciette Pasta The chips looking things they gave me with my pasta was pretty good. The tomato sauce ...I didn't like it. The vegetables were chunky and weren't cut good ..but that probably doesn't matter to a lot of people, I just like my veggies cut nicely.  The little earlobe pastas were good. The mock breaded chicken ...normal.   Atmosphere This place has a casual artistic atmosphere. They have flyers supporting locals around and they also have Java magazine for anyone to look at and take.   Employees Nice, happy employees. I just found it a bit weird that she got a bit tense and hesitant when I asked her about the food like she was afraid I was going to ask about the healthy stuff of the ingredients or something.

You can tell it's not real chicken, but the flavor it has is good on its own. The reason it's called the Wendy's Pickle is because it's loaded with pickles...I'm a huge pickle fan, so I was happily content.  My daughter had the Chicago Cheesteak and I found myself wishing I ordered it, because it was pretty tasty. It consists of mock steak filled with onions and peppers, the only thing it was missing is mushrooms...that would have sealed the deal, but it was good nonetheless.  My granddaugther had the Animal fries, which is a vegan version of the In & Out classic, it had vegan cheese, onions and Thousand Island sauce, and it was addicting.

Seriously, every dish I've had here beats its non-vegetarian counterpart by several strides. The fake chicken tastes better than real chicken, especially when it's seasoned so well here.   Everything from the eggless spring rolls to the fake meat bowls and flatbread pizzas is wonderful. Top any dish with endless toppings for just $1 and finish your meal with a tsoynami dessert.

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "First, it must be understood that this is a review for the Tempe location (which is pretty much in the southern tip of Scottsdale but that isn't here and it isn't there either) that has been newly remodeled. I will not speak in length of the old décor as it has no more relevance to the epitome of swank that is the new look at Green. I won't talk about the recycled material art that lined the South wall that included lightly painted utensil drawer organizers and VW hubcaps. I also won't talk about the slightly preachy overly optimistic quote that wrapped the wall through the corner near the restrooms written in a fun script only an undergrad girl studying design theory and armed with a paint brush could achieve. I also won't mention the antique Piano up against the dividing wall that in spirit only begged one thing of whoever laid eyes on it, it's modest demand was to be played in a manner worthy of the Saloons that once occupied the desert space where Green now lies, yet the only text on the instrument was a small sign written with a marker saying  Please Do Not Play Piano. I also won't talk about the loooooong table going from front door to register that on busy nights you'd get stuck sitting at with two of your friends only to have your back brushed against by numerous vegetarian butts that graze only on accident and rarely warrant an apology but still. . . no buns on the back please.   I will however mention their new patio that has arrived just in time for the cold season when dining on said patio will surely manifest in me a tension worthy of Hitchcock's direction between enjoying sweater weather with solely my hot entrée or hitting the tipping point of finger numbing cold with my seemingly mandatory post-dinner Tsoynami. The caged in effect achieved by the patio might be resonant to that of a human cage, which to give credit to the designer might be the intent. The subtext of the patio may read something to the effect of Peter Signer's breakthrough work, Animal Liberation, eliciting the contradictory feeling of being outside and feeling claustrophobic and caged in thus allowing the patron to empathize with the plight of factory farmed animals and subsequently prompting the euphoric smugness that comes from the knowledge that no animals were harmed or exploited in making that mock steak po'boy (except maybe the dudes in the kitchen scraping by for minimum wage*). The vintage car doors are still in effect over freshly vinyled booths that safely seat four, but typically six, partially due to their limited seating and mostly due to the nearly miniature size of the average patron who tend to be slight, frail and eager to show they don't mind a little contact.  The alternative girl vibe that exudes from the front of the house staff meshes well with the obvious southwestern conventionality of the kitchen staff. A powerclash in true form. If you disregard their post-Juno fashion choices you see some of the nicest, under-tipped, funny people in the local service industry. Calling in an order is as easy as vegan pie and pretty swift too. I've frequented this location for 5 years and don't intend to stop anytime soon. The Secret BBQ Chicken sandwich is at the top of the charts but if not that then the Argentine Po'boy is a fine choice as well. Hands down one of my favorite places in the Valley.  Here's a Tip: don't be a dummy, add Chai to your Tsoynami.  *I have no idea how the kitchen staff is compensated."}

I am not vegan, but I have an egg allergy, which makes eating dessert hard sometimes :'(  Green holds a special place in my heart because it was the first place I ever ate dinner at in Arizona. When I moved to Arizona my mom (who also has an egg allergy) came out to look at apartments with me. We were staying around the corner at the Holiday Inn in Old Town, where they recommended we eat at Green for vegan food. We then returned every day for either lunch or dinner for the remainder of our trip. Once I arrived in Arizona I used to get Green at least once a week, generally as take out. Everything is delicious, not really super healthy for the most part but I can deal with that when I am eating vegan food sometimes! I also don't think that is the goal here, I believe Green is taking a vegan twist on comfort foods and they do it well. I used to get a Coffee Tsoynami and the Calexico Burger--so good, but you'll need a siesta afterwards.  I personally prefer when not a lot of meat substitutes are used in vegan food, which is the only reason why I am giving Green 4 instead of 5 stars. Most dishes use a meat substitute like seitan or tofu, though I'm sure you can avoid this by ordering something else with beans for example. I feel sad I never went to Nami in my time out in Phoenix and when I visit next I will need to try their food out too in addition to returning to Green!"}

First, salads - I'm currently obsessed with the Spicy Peanut chicken salad, but also love the Green salad..simple light and tasty.  Sandwiches - Spicy Po Boy....love it.  Bowls - Kung Pao is my favorite. I also like the spicy peanut bowl.  They are actually both very similar though so either is great. Pizza - the Western..delish! And probably the best part of Green....the Soynami. I've had several and all are amazing and better than any other soft serve option I was throwing down my gullet before I began Vegan. Sometimes they even have a wedding cake soynami.  If you ever see this on the menu get it! Oh and how could I forget the apps....hummus and wings are my favorite. This place is very reasonably priced too.  We can get an app, two meals, and a soynami for about $25 bucks.  The staff is always super nice and friendly. Service is always fast too. The atmosphere is pretty funky and cool although you might not see this from the outside. Just go inside - you'll be fine.

I happened to notice on the receipt they upcharged us 50 cents to add cucumber (really, $6.50 for lettuce, cucumber and dressing?). Anyways. Kids wanted a chocolate chip cookie for $2 each, which they both said tasted good but a bit dry. I ordered the Banana Cream pie Tsoynami, which I highly recommend.

Speaking to the tsoynamis, they are delicious. Soy based ice-cream blizzard treats. I didn't realize how much I had missed milkshakes since going pescatarian, and this tasted like it came from Dairy Queen (I got the cookies-n-cream tsoynami). All the yummy goodness of a blizzard w/o any of the stomach aches, health issues, or moral issues (or whatever reason you've given up dairy).   The rest of the menu looks innovative and tasty and I wish we had more time in Scottsdale to try more items.   If you were to compare this to a non-vegan place, I don't know if it would rank as high. But, for what it is, this place seems to have found a niche and is doing it well.  **things to note** This place is almost impossible to find. It is tucked away in a corner in a non-descript strip-mall (by a car dealership if I remember correctly). If I didn't have GPS, I would have given up on trying to find it.

Today I waited for 35 min for my food, had other people who ordered after me served, then when they finally noticed me, they came over and told me to come up and ask if my food is taking too long. Isn't that their job to serve in a timely manner? Since when do I pay $10 for $4 worth of food to not get served?  On top of it, they screwed up my order, I had to go back in and get it fixed (more waiting time). Being late, being stupid, and being wrong? Three strikes in one visit - this place is done.   I won't be going back."}

We wound up selecting bar food, animal fries, hummus, wings, and spinach dip. He loved the wings; great texture with a delightful flavorful sauce and dip. We both loved the hummus, super fresh with a little kick. The chips it comes with were yummy, not heavy at all. The spinach dip was weird, almost had a chemical flavor to it, we wouldn't order that again. The animal fries were naughty, in the best possible way. We will definitely be back, for some healthier fair. Service was friendly, like you were eating over at a friends house. The decor and music is old Mill avenue, chill, hip and fun."}

The atmosphere was fun and lively. The only things that I was not thrilled about is the seating. Basically you have to run to an empty table, bus it yourself, and if the table isn't empty you have to intrude on people that are getting ready to leave. I don't mind asking people if they are done with their meal but I felt a little awkward doing it, like I was rushing them..... The other negative is the way that the staff screams your name when your food is up. I think if they implemented a number system the whole place would function more efficiently. Overall, the experience was pleasant, the food was great, and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely be going back."}

BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.  my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos.   their pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.  green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head."}

I have a plethora of choices to eat from and not have to worry about what its made with and if its vegan or not.   2. Tsoynamis. Nuf' said.  3. Vegan crab puffs!!!  4. You have specials that change all of the time! I just wish you would make about 90% of these specials permanent menu items! I love some of them so much it depresses me when they run out or are no longer available. Example, the Chicken Schwarma wrap. I would KILL for that to be on the menu. It is my favorite thing ever.   5. Most of your staff are some of the coolest people ever, and always remember us. Its nice when staff remember you (and your favorite specials). It also helps that my husband and I have been here at least 50 times in the last year.   6. You don't just make me choose from a few measly salads. You have sandwiches, pizza, pasta, bowls, appetizers. The BBQ chicken and the Mexicali burgers are the greatest things ever.   7. You are relatively close to my house, and I don't have to trek 30 miles to get there. So if at 8pm I decide I want you, I can get to you and not have to worry about making it before you close.   8. You have an in store market where if I feel the need to pick up a box of vegan mac and cheese, I can.   There are tons of reasons to eat here, whether you are vegan or not. You have to try this place. It is amazing and no matter what you get off the menu, you will not be disappointed."}

The sandwich was smothered in sauce, and was overwhelming my mouth with flavor to the point where I had to wipe off excess sauce. The patty was limp and tiny and although it was vegan, it could never compare to a real chicken patty. Overall, I was completely dissatisfied with my overly priced sandwich. The only good thing about this place was quick service and clean bathrooms."}

I've been to a few of these types of restaurants.  This place has all the healthy entrees one could want without the flair of a pretentious hipster taking your order.  Best of all everything on the menu looks good.  They simply make things that people like without trying to reinvent the wheel with some sort crazy food combination/fusion.  I always enjoy eating at a place without having to read some detailed instructions from the chef on how the proper way of eating it should be for the best flavor. (Yes, it's happened)  Since I'm not entirely used to Arizona's 6 degrees hotter than hell heat I have gotten the tsoynamis and their peanut butter and chocolate crack bar.  It's the perfect fix for that sweet tooth craving that I get from time to time, or in this case three or four times this week.  I'm coming back tomorrow for lunch with my beautiful wife and I'm going for the buffalo wings because they've been calling me day and night.  This place is worth the 673 mile drive and the only bad thing I can say about it is that once I leave this weekend I'm going to crave this place.

Jerk Tofu is tangy and over a bed of greens is like flakes of heaven.  If you need a little more bites: Thyme fries, just skinny fries with thyme. Buffalo Wings are delicious, they're just like the real thing, but a little chewier. If you like curry, the samosas are superb. I could eat 3 orders of them throughout a binge marathon on Netflix.  If you still have some room in your tummy, you MUST get a Tsoynami! They have seasonal flavors and their standard ones. I usually try the seasonals, but PBnJ is also my jam *pun intended.

But i like green for the effort, tastes, and ambiance.  The variety is pretty good ranging from salads, pizzas, burgers, po-boys and noodles.  This time i had the Mexicali burger and my lady friend had the spicy peanut sause noodles (with is pretty much like a Thai noodle bowl, with mock-chicken).  The burger was sup-par.  the patty was more of a ground meat texture than a patty so it broke apart easily.  The flavor wasnt really there and it took ketchup and siracha sauce to bring it up.  The fries however very very good.  Thin cut, light and crispy.  Definitely a highlight of that meal.  as for the Thai noodles, it was pretty good too. The mock chicken was very good. not too dry and had a good texture to it...dare i say almost like chicken.  My only complaint is the price.  You really dont get for what you pay for.  the portions  are a lil small and the tofu/mock meat are far and few in between.  but still relatively inexpensive to eat, all entrees are about $10.  but we could get a lil more fries, or noodles or vegies for that much.  another complaint was didnt save enough room for the tsoynami ice creams they looked absolutely delish.  next time... next time  Pros -only vegan in town -flavorful with a good selection of dishes -cute decor   Cons: -meals a lil small for $10, but not that bad."}

I thought I heard someone mention that it was vegan. No, there's no way a chicken wing could be vegan. But then I heard it again- everything is vegan. You might say that I loaded up on those little buffalo wings, but who could blame me! There's a reason they've won awards... they're amazing! Next, I tried the mock chicken skewers that were smothered in green's original espresso barbecue sauce. I have to say that Green has really nailed the mock meat. The texture, flavor and taste are so authentic that sometimes I find myself second guessing the mock in the meat.  It's no surprise that off of their regular menu, my favorites are the buffalo chicken sandwich and the barbecue chicken sandwich. I also order a plate of the buffalo wings as an appetizer every time I stop in. Their pasta bowls are also really good, and their mock meatballs are pretty delicious. My only less than stellar experience at Green was when I ordered the Mexi-Cali burger. I'm not sure what the patty was made of, but it was red, and I wasn't really into the flavor. But the thyme shoe string fries rescued the meal and my tummy.  The lemon-aide and lime-aide are also delicious, and I would recommend giving them a shot if you're generally a cola-junkie.  One last tip would be to get there early on Saturday nights as they get pretty busy and you might be hard pressed to find an open table."}

I think the sandwiches are honestly a little better than their stir-fry stuff but   this does not detract from how awesome the place is.  Go for the Spicy G if you want a spicy faux-chicken thing or the Argentine PoBoy for a delicious, sweet flanksteak-type meat sandwich.    It is a little pricey sometimes, but you are paying for specialty foods.  Their vegan/veggie market in the store is convenient if you want to try something out, but it's really marked up in comparison to buying almost any of these things from the internet (not even in bulk)."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "My last couple experiences at this location of Green have not been so great.  On my most recent visit, my friend and I both ordered Drunken Mushroom bowls with chicken.  My daughter ordered something off their new kids' menu.  When our bowls arrived, neither one of them had any mushrooms!  What the...?!  Also, my daughter's food came way after ours arrived.      When a manager came out because our bowls were made incorrectly, he did not apologize.  He just said he didn't know how it happened and he'd make sure they were made right.  We waited an awfully long time for the mushrooms to be added to the bowls.  And, while I did not expect anything as a comp for our inconvenience, we did not get anything comped.  We also asked if they had any bowls that were not made with sugar in the sauce due to my friend being a diabetic.  They told us they had NO sauces or marinades that did not contain sugar.  Wow.  I knew Green was like fast food for Vegans, but there should be SOMETHING without added sugar.  Perhaps a simple soy and garlic marinade?  Since they had to remake our bowls anyway, my friend just got vegetables without any sauce added.    While I still do love the Green New American Vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix, this location just does not have the customer service or the attention to detail that the other location has.    Sadly, I don't make it to this part of town enough to warrant a return visit after this last visit."}

She had been here once before with less than desirable food, but figured she'd give it one more shot.  Well, no more shots for Green are in our future...  We ordered at the desk and our food came out within 15 minutes. No big deal there. My friend ordered the artichoke dip that was served with chips and hummus that was served  with deep fried pita chips, and I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken.   If you didn't tell me there was artichokes in the dip, I would have never known. It was more of an enchilada sauce/bean dip weird mess. Not horrible on the pallet, but def not what we expected was ordered. The Hummus was spicy and came with a pickle (??) on the side. Pita crisps were way too deep fried for their own good. Needless to say... we did not ask for a to-go box.   The Kung Pao chicken wasn't bad per-say, but my Chicken was very stringy and foamy to the texture. Yes, I said I wasn't a veggie head, but I have had Morning Star chicken before and it's 10 times better than what  came in my bowl.  I get veggie heads love this spot because they don't have to narrow down the menu to 2 items, but me thinks not."}

This vegan restaurant is for people who like animal products as much it is for people who don't.  Almost everything on the menu comes with at least an option of mock meat of one kind or another.  And mock meat is tasty, though probably not necessarily healthy.  The original g spicy po-boy reminded me almost exactly of Switch's Buffalo Bleu Chicken sandwich (my favorite).  It was hardly noticeable that Green's version had no bleu cheese, mock chicken patties and veganaise.  The texas moo-shroom po-boy was excellent as well with a sweet BBQ sauce and heaps of mushrooms, red peppers and onions.  I do not like the tahini coleslaw - too much peanut sauce.  We were so impressed with our lunch that we ordered a couple of cookies for dessert and that was when we remembered the reason we could never be entirely vegan....no butter in the cookies!  At least they use real chocolate instead of carob.  I also enjoy all of the green building products on the walls, but not the styrofoam cups, so much."}

The spice level of the sauce was perfect it had a really nice kick to it, but not  the point of watering eyes. My one complaint was the gluten free bread. The texture and density of it was not good.  It was really dry and it soaked up too much of the sauces on my sandwich.   Not going to lie though,  I was still hungry after I finished eating. Mind you i just finished playing a sand volleyball tournament. So next I ordered the green hummus the chicken wings and the BFF which is a fried chicken sandwich to try and take home leftovers. The hummus was great, as well as the corn tortilla chips it was served with, nice and crunchy. The hummus said it was made with roasted poblano peppers which I didn't notice but it was very tasty. I didn't like the quality of the chicken wings as much as the chicken in the chicken sandwich. It may have been the same but just sliced differently. And as for the BFF fried chicken sandwich it was outstanding. non-vegans might have thought this was real Fried Chicken. I also asked for a side of their Expreso barbecue sauce which turned out to have great tang and flavor. I can't wait to go back and try more menu items."}

Here you can find inventive takes on veghead staples such as salads and Thai-inspired noodle dishes to daring vegan versions of chili fries and hot wings (made from mushroom stems) that prove worthy rivals to the animal-involved originals. The bistro features a varied menu, bolstered by specials that change daily. Green also features a handful of prepackaged vegan specialty foods, including gelatin-free marshmallows.  Perhaps what I like best about Green is its hip, progressive vibe that has not fallen victim to the snotty hipster nonsense so prevalent in The Valley's cool restaurants. On the contrary, the staff at Green is always helpful and friendly."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "So my doctor has put me on a mandatory 1 month vegan diet. Lucky for me Green is a vegan restaurant!   I have always wanted to try Green, but had never really had an excuse to go.   So Friday night the hubs and I make the trek across town. We arrived about 630 and it was JAM PACKED. Not a seat to be had. At Green you stand in line and place your order at the register and pay for it then. You find a seat and a waiter will come out and yell your name and then deliver your food.   We placed our order and took a table outside as that was all there was. Kinda sucked, but oh well. It did start to rain, but there was a little over hang keeping us dry.  We ordered starters. Crab Puffs and Spicy Buffalo wings Both were pretty good. The crab puffs were spot on, you really couldn't tell a difference between them and the real thing. The wings were good as well, but for sure a big difference between the real thing and the mock. But still tasty.   The hubs ordered the Original g Spicy Po-Boy, a Spicy buffalo mock chicken sammie and I got the Mum's Meatball Po-Boy. Both were really very good. The Thyme fries are really crisp and tasty, but like other reviews, you cant really taste the thyme, not sure whats up with that.   After we were done, we decided to get a couple Tsoynamis to go. I am a ice cream FREAK, so that WAS going to be my biggest challenge getting through the 1 month Vegan diet...but not anymore. OMG...The tsoynami's are AMAZING!!! I had the Deez Hazelnuts, freaken fantastic! The hubs got the Betterfinger (Greens version of a butterfinger) SO GOOD!!!!   We will be going back to green even after I am done with my 1 month stint as a vegan."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "I decided to re-write my review for Green. Since then I have been handed a plethora of new information about their menu that might make it more appealing for almost anyone.  One of my previous complaints was that besides some of their sandwiches and their salads, their food was particularly oily, or greasy, etc. I thought, this place is too good not to have some sort of alternative to this situation and guess what? There is a solution. I admit, I prematurely judged the cuisine before asking enough questions. Turns out, almost everything on the menu, especially the entrees are customizable to the point that you can almost make anything on the menu fit your preference and the staff is more than accommodating and gracious about it.   I have since had a lot of items on the menu and been able to get many items to fit my dietary preferences: sandwiches (the Wendy's Pickle is a great customizable one), almost all the bowls I have tried with less oil, steamed veggies, or light sauce, etc. The salads I have swapped out the meats for different kinds of tofu or light sauce, etc. Almost every time, my food has been delicious and if it wasn't, it was usually because my choice of customization was poor.   Not to mention, like I said in the last review, this location has great service, as do all the locations and it is clean too.   Whether a ravenous carnivore, local vegetarian vegan, out-of-towner, or whatever, I can pretty much attest to the fact that you'll more than likely find one, probably, two items on the menu to satisfy an appetite."}

Green provides all sorts of different menu items They have rice and noodles bowls with mock meats and tofu, salads, burgers and sandwiches, mini pizzas, and delicious Soynamis which are their soy based ice cream (delicious) They have specials as well so you may want to follow them on twitter or like them on facebook!  Green  also gives you a selection of side items including fries, tahini coleslaw(a favorite) pasta, etc and many come with the main item as a meal. They also include appetizers including artichoke gratine which was a yummy dip with chips, vegan chilli fries, crab puffs(another favorite!) and boneless wings with their homemade vegan ranch dressing. The only unfortunate thing is that both times I've had their wings they have been way too salty. So it kind of ruins it.  My fav things to get there, and if you're going there for the first time you must try their sandwiches! I am a huge fan of their secret bbq chickn sandwich. Messy but it is so satisfying and almost creepy on how well it imitates a real chicken sandwich but it's guiltfree and deliciously crafted! This sandwich will not let you down! My boyfriend also got me into the argetine which has a steaky taste mock meat in  a sub-type sandwich that will sure to make your mouth water. I have had one of their noodle bowls with mock beef and sweet and sour flavor but it was not as filling as their sandwiches. Maybe because I didn't think there was enough noodles but they're pretty good!   Now the place itself is pretty hipster. Artsy feel and vibe and many times there will be artwork for sale or art contests going on. It's definately a cool environment they have a couple couches and its a great place to dine in and bring your friends. It's not really a waiter/waitress type thing. You grab a menu in line order what you want at the counter and pay and then they bring it out to you when it's ready. Most the time it's ready rather quickly and you don't have to worry about flagging down a waitress/waiter if you need anything.  Green also hosted I think it was the 3rd annual thankliving last year that I went to for the first time that had a delicious vegan thanksgiving plate that included everything you could imagine for thanksgiving veganized! Delicious! Definitely an event you don't want to miss!  All and all I love this place. Veg comfort food at it's best!! And it's not just for Vegans I swear even if you're not a herbivore you will love green!"}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "As an on-again, off-again vegetarian, I really value culinary experiences that are so good, or so interesting, that I don't miss meat. Green doesn't quite meet (meat?) this standard: though they make some of the best meatless meat dishes in town, I still catch myself thinking, This would be even better if it was made of beef and bacon. Their imitation beef and chicken are impressively like the real things, but that's the fundamental problem (in my humble opinion) with this style of vegetarian cuisine: no matter how good you make it, like the real thing is never gonna beat the real thing. Their veggie burgers are tasty, but burgers are tastier. Soynamis are pretty good, but milkshakes will always be better. I know that New American is their thing, but I think Green would be even better if they took a little more inspiration from traditions like Indian and Middle Eastern, which have done spectacular things without meat for thousands of years.  None of this, of course, means I won't continue to eat here pretty frequently. I love their egglessrolls, poboys (both Original and Argentine... especially the Argentine with extra chimichurri sauce). Their thyme fries are pretty good, but I don't really taste the thyme. I've gotten a couple bowls, which have been good but a little sparse on the mock meat. A cheap and delicious option is to get a side of lo mein with some mock beef."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Mediocre at best. Admittedly we only tried 2 different rice bowls but they were exactly the same other than the different sauces. Vegetables were undercooked. Ratio of rice/veggies/sauce seemed off. Seems like maybe one of their sandwiches is a better way to go? Cool place but have had much better vegan food in the area."}

Every time I come back there's something new and something old.  Improvements and renovations are always made in this quaint little corner restaurant.  I don't feel like I'm a hippie when I come here since there seems to be all walks of life young and old that come here.    Today I started with a craft beer and the Big Wac Burger.  I actually order the little Wac with fries since the Big Wac seemed like a little too big for my appetite.  Overall, it was a knock-off version of the Big Mac, but with no processed meat.  I thought it was pretty interesting, but in the end nothing too original.  My buddy ordered their spicy buffalo wings made with soy chicken -- this was probably my favorite bite of the night; spicy indeed and a hint of crunch.  I think if they didn't douse it was the sauce it would have made a perfect combination, but still good overall.  I also ordered the Soynami for dessert; a valley favorite and must eat especially during the summer time.  It's pretty much soft serve ice cream in a pint with toppings of your choice of candies or baked goods.    In the end, Green is definitely a local hot spot for vegetarians, but also foodies whom want to venture out and try something new.  With the popularity of Non-GMO and Vegan movement coming strong; I can see Green staying for generations ahead! - Enjoy!"}

It had great flavor, and it was very filling. I also drank the Sweet Lime, which was very refreshing, especially in 106 degree heat. Everyone we were with enjoyed their food, except my boyfriend, who wasn't too into their version of fake mozzarella cheese...was kind of rubbery, but um, what do you expect?

Luckily I am almost done with every aspect of the God Forsaken Phoenix area (finally back to So Cal in 2018) but decided to give Green another shot for a quick lunch.  Being a workday I did not have 2 hours for lunch and thought I would be pretty safe ordering a damn burger and chili....   Wrong!!! It took 45 minutes to get my order due to the supposed reason that more Chili was being made. Well when I finally got my order the Chili was cold and the burger was so so.  In addition ( and this is where the arrogance comes in) the kid who brought my order forgot to bring a spoon for the Chili and when I went up to ask for one a pimply faced girl who was working the register gave me attitude.  Keep your attitude to your self and Greens staff should visit vegan restaurants in LA or the Bay Area to see how it's done.

But I have one bone to pick with the menu (is that a bad phrase to use for a vegetarian restaurant?): it needs more selections that truly celebrate the vegetable. Almost everything available is mock beef, fake chicken and faux pork. That's fine, I guess, especially for recent vegetarian meat-eaters who are missing some of the old textures and flavors. But for long-time veggies - and even for carnivores like me looking for variety - the menu could stand to have a few more dishes celebrating beans and mushrooms and soy and all the other incredible flora that are just fine being themselves and not pretending to be flesh.  It's better that way - and, let's face it, that veggie burger is never going to taste as good as the real burger if that's what you are really after."}

They have salads, sandwiches, burgers, pitas, and all types of food from American to Asian, to Italian and more. They cary the best micro brewed sodas i have ever had. The prices are very reasonable and the employees are always very nice and give great customer service. Today I had Wendy's Pickle which is a breaded mock chicken cutlet with southern style spicy mayo and dill pickles.  The bread is so soft and delicious you would never guess it was made without milk or eggs. The cutlet looks and tastes so much like chicken that you don't miss the chicken at all. Add in the spicy and creamy mayo, and pickles and you have a fantastic lunch that would make anyone jealous wether they are vegan, vegetarian or a carnivore. The dish is served with thyme fries, tahini coleslaw or fresh fruit. I got the fries this time but I have tried the other sides and they are also great. The fries are long shoe string fries that are perfectly fried and have the best potato flavor with a crispy yet soft texture that makes you want to slam them in your face to keep the happiness going as long as possible.

I was not expecting the pieces of chicken to be breaded and fried. I was expecting it to be more like grilled chicken. They didn't really belong in a dish with a cream sauce.  Speaking of the blonde alfredo sauce, it's very good! Tastes very similar to the real thing. I will definitely be getting this wonderful dish again but I will probably get plain tofu or no meat on it at all.  For the Mac and Cheez it was lacking in flavor and the cheese was not melted enough.  The BBBQ bacon burger had a bit too much mayo and barbecue sauce on it. The tempeh bacon was okay, but nothing like actual bacon. It was too thick and did not really have the flavor of bacon. The sauteed portabella mushrooms and caramelized onions were the best part of the burger, along with the sesame seed bun!  The chicken nuggz had the flavor and texture of real chicken nuggets! The barbecue sauce and ranch dressing it comes with are also wonderful.

Last time I ask some Nachos at the location on Phoenix and literally they were full of grease. I end up throwing half of the nachos. Also, when you ask for a bowl, you get rice, 3 or 4 pieces of mock chicken or beef and tons of carrots and broccoli. They have been removing some dishes and deserts that were very good. Alfredo's bowl and also the soynami monsoon. Hope some day they get back with the quality that everybody expects. Last thing, most of the people that goes over there ask for a burger, I guess it is the best way to substitute McDonalds and burger king, but again you have too  start measuring the grease. We asked a BFF last week and my wife had to remove the crust. It was wet in grease"}

The Big Wack tasted just like a Big Mac...and the thyme fries were thin and crispy and perfect!  The tahini coleslaw was also very good.  The Calexico burger was good, but not as good as the Big Wack.  We also had the artichoke gratin.  Good, but probably wouldn't order it again.  We had lunch there again the following day because there were other menu items we wanted to try, and were we're so full from our burgers the previous day that we didn't have room for a soynami.  This time we tried the Singapore orange bowl with house tofu and brown rice, and the Kung pow with house tofu and noodles.  Both were really good, but the Singapore orange was better, as was he rice.  Lots of veggies and tofu cooked perfectly.  We even had room to share a soynami made with homemade vegan kit kats and chocolate syrup.  It was really good...although the kit kat could have been chopped smaller.  All in all, really yummy.  Not health food by any means....and quite salty, but yummy still."}

The place is never too packed and is super casual.  You walk up and the hardest choice is what to try.  Don't worry you can't go wrong.  Every time we have gone the cashiers have been very helpful if you are still deciding between two options.  For food, I would recommend the BBQ po boy.  It comes with a little kick.  The fries are always good and come with a great ketchup.  I am not a big fan of the thai slaw, so I would definitely go with the fries.  I have also had the pizzas and they are always safe.  The veggie burger is good, but if mushy burgers freak you out, then go another direction.  I do wish is a was a bit more firm.  If you are looking for a ridiculous treat, grab a Soynami on the way out.  My fave is the mint chocolate version.  One small thing that I do hate though is they serve them with wooden spoons and I am a bit weird and HATE eating off a wooden spoon.  Am I weird?  The soynami is so good, I still do it though.  Finally I am happy to have this place in town.  I am always amazed that Phx does not have more dedicated veg/vegan places for as big as it is.

We called in our order and decided to pick up order took less than 10 min in and out great :-). The burger was great I could see why it's a big hit and the French fries are awesome I ate the whole batch. What really made my day was the organic sweet lime drink omg it was not too sweet and not too bland but just perfect mix almost like what u would like ur lemonade to come out like. The price was a lil high for me $11.50 for the meal but I think it was worth it. I was beyond full. The bad  I asked the cashier if it was possible to try the tea with a sample cup she said yes and gave me a big cup and charged me for it even though I asked just to sample maybe I didn't say it loud enough, and she charged me for it without first confirming that the price went up it ended up being ok as I liked the drinks they had.

My friend and I got the wings to start, the red diablo, and the kung pao bowl.  The wings were really good, and I love the dipping sauce they came with!  I was in heaven with my red diablo bowl.  I loved the consistency of the mock chicken and the eggplant had been soaked in sauce for a while so it was completely mushy, just the way I like it!  I completely polished off my bowl, and my friend did the same.  Yet he was still craving the tsoynami since the guy at the counter gave us a free sample.  After going through all of our options, at which point he decided we would never be friends again because I don't like coffee, rootbeer, or mint, we decided on the rocky road tsoynami.  These things are huge and perfect to split with someone for an after dinner treat.  They definitely do not skimp on the toppings.

Hubby's pad-thai-ish dish was pretty good, with noodles, a zippy sauce, and big crunchy veggies. All of which makes the nastiness of the egg(less) rolls even more inexplicable. They were positively mushy inside, and had both hot and cold spots. Maybe it's just me, but I like some texture and identifiable ingredients in my egg rolls. They were also weirdly spiced and arrived without the dipping sauce advertised in the menu. The busser admitted they were made ahead of time, which certainly doesn't help matters. He didn't seem to care that we thought they were bad- he just shrugged and said, Well SOME people don't like them. Well, I guess we're SOME people then. We also tried the much praised pseudo crab puffs, and they were pretty good, especially with the dipping sauce that managed to come out with this plate. Hubby also had to have the soy blizzard. He liked it, and I thought the taste was fine initially, but then had an aftertaste I didn't care for.   The atmosphere is clearly meant for hipster youngsters. The lighting was so low that I literally had a hard time reading the white on black menu. Seriously, Green. Have some consideration for your clientele over 20.   The last thing that left a negative impression was some of the staff. As we finished our meal, they were starting to close. Hubby went up to the counter to order his soy blizzard and the too-cool-for-the-rest-of-us young man behind the counter had to ask a co-worker if they were still making them. Um, if you still have customers in the restaurant, I would imagine you should still be making them. It's not like we were in there for a half hour past closing, and there were still many customers in the place.   One last observation: what's up with all the vegetarian and vegan smokers clogging the entrance? God forbid there be any animal products in your bodies, but bring on the tar and chemicals!?! As someone who quit smoking after many years, I would appreciate it if Green would insist that their customers observe the keep-it-20-feet-from-the-entrance ordinance."}

Me and my gf came and two dishes a couple appetizers and drinks came to over $60. The food is quality and not greatly over priced or anything, would feel better about it if everything was organic.

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Go to Green! I've had problems in the past with servers, but I believe those employees have moved on from Green. Other than that, let me list the reasons why I love Green:  1. I am a vegetarian. It's nice to have a completely vegan restaurant--I don't have to worry about what I can/cannot eat on the menu! Also, the food tastes like vegetarian food. This could be confusing to meat-eaters, so let me explain; a lot of vegetarian options at places that serve meat are cooked like you would cook meat, therefore the taste is different. It's nice not to be overloaded with spices or sauce just because it's all veggie food.  2. The atmosphere is comfortable. Sometimes the music is a little loud, but it's definitely not as bad as a lot of other places around The Valley.  3. Take Out! This is one of my favorite places to grab food after roller derby practice! It's quick, healthy, and filling.  4. I have a lot of friends that eat meat. Not one of them has said anything negative about the food here. Plus, the people here don't look down on meat-eaters. One of my biggest pet-peeves is when vegetarian extremists think lowly of people that eat meat--you're giving a bad name to us other vegetarians! Calm down!   5. It's affordable. Yes! Affordable vegetarian food! Amazing, right?!  6. Have a Tsoynami. No, really. Trust me.  Personally, I think the food tastes better at this location than the 7th Street location. And, as mentioned earlier, there have been a couple of staff members that have been...well...rather rude. But they don't work here anymore, as far as I can tell. There's always a rotten apple, right?

Let me warn you:  VEGAN DOES NOT MEAN HEALTHY  Sure, a vegan diet can be healthier than a meat diet, depending on whose advice you're following. Fried starches are vegan, sugar is vegan, overly- processed chemical meat substitutes are vegan... you get the idea.  That being said, this place is tasty. They offer a substantial and varied menu to appeal to the masses while maintaining a no-harm attitude. Even the to-go containers are eco-friendly. I had the Thai peanut bowl with mock chicken and brown rice. I don't usually go for the fake n' bake, but I was persuaded. This was convincing, but I would probably go for the tofu next tme. The sauce was delicious and the dish was satisfying, the veggie to chicken ratio was impressive (lots of both). Hubsky ordered thee Argentine po-boy, a fake steak sandwich with caremelized peppers and onions with vegan mayo and chimichuri sauce. He found that satidfying. I tasted it for reviewing purposes, and I have to say that it was spicy and tasty, but again, I prefer tofu or veggies to fake meat. They did a great job of approximating the texture of steak with the seitan, but the immitation was of a fattier cut of steak. I would have preferred a chewier texture well-done texture. I packed up half my dish to leave room for the much touted Tsoynami. It lived up to its reputation. The varieties available can be overwhelming. I had a Newman's Own chocolate mint thing, but I would probably go for something completely chocolate next time. The mint was too sweet for me.

In my humble opinion, it takes a near act of God to make quinoa taste like food that a non-ancient Inca would enjoy. The same goes for acai, or as I like to call it dirt fruit. Part of the reason that I choose to be vegan is health, but another part is because I enjoy eating good food.   The reason that I give Green five stars is because they make tasty, straight forward vegan grub. It's not pretentious, nor does it get too adventurous for its own good. I don't live close by, but every time we come to spring training (What? A vegan baseball fan? I thought they were all hippies. Are you sure it isn't practice for burning man?) I make an effort to eat here.   I'm used to having one or two choices from a menu, and it's always a little overwhelming to have so many choices. I asked the cashier what they recommended and she directed me to the item voted best faux chicken sandwich in the US by VegNews, the Secret BBQ Chicken. She did not steer me wrong- it was great. My 6 year old wanted the peanut sauce noodle bowl, but it was too spicy for his sensitive, young palate. When I told the woman up front (after avoiding the long, Saturday dinner line) she said that it was no problem, and gave us a No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich for my son, who loved it. I offered to pay and she refused. Right there, she made a customer for life. You should be too.  After all this, I didn't get one of the fantastic looking Soy-Nami deserts. What a mean dad.

I also got a side of the tahini coleslaw because I was intrigued on what their spin would be.  The sandwich was sizeable and delicious! I'm not vegetarian but the mock chicken tasted great and the outer layer was lightly crispy/fried to add some nice texture to the sandwich.  The tahini cole slaw wasn't like your average cole slaw. It had shredded green and purple cabbage, but also green onions and peanuts. I'm not sure what else it was tossed in besides tahini, but I loved it. It wasn't heavy or drenched in a creamy sauce like some cole slaws are but it was light, crunchy, and fresh.  The restaurant itself is located in a building strip that has a few empty businesses making it slightly hard to see from the main road but the inside was very nice and there's a patio with chairs and umbrellas you can sit out on.

We all have our favorites, of course, but there is not a single thing on the menu that I have found distasteful.   The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere is nice. The music can be a bit loud sometimes but that is not a big deal, especially since there is an outside area which is nice during the non-summery times.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I love this place and I'm not even Vegan. Though, after eating at GREEN, I'm seriously considering Vegetarianism.  Problem is: I'm a creature of habit. When I find a meal I like, I just reorder it over and over. (note to self: change that!)  My meal of choice at Green is the Mongolian Noodle Bowl w/the mock chicken, which is to die for. The veggies are fresh & flavorful and the mock chicken is absolutely delicious.   Equally as satisfying is the Soynami, frozen vegan ice cream delight and the Peanut butter thingy.  I do wish they had more drink choices.   The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'd like to see them use whole wheat noodles and Organic. But really, that's minor. Cause like the other review mentions, their other restaurant That's a Wrap in Phoenix has healthier fare.  For the conscientious greenie, GREEN lives up to their name in more ways than one! The floors are concrete, the tables are made from sustainable materials (is that sorghum?) and they are definitely saving energy with what appears to be a swamp cooler. Not overly cooling on a hot Arizona afternoon but energy efficient.  Green is hands down my favorite Arizona restaurant and I've been here for 8 years. Arizona definitely needs more of these type restaurants.  The downside? They're about 40 or more miles away from my home. But with the food quality, relaxed atmosphere and Green interior, it's worth the trek for me."}

Since we were a little tired after hiking we decided to find a dedicated vegan place and spend sometime at that restaurant.  I selected it as it was rated high and not too far from the airport. The ambience was very nice and the place was very busy when we arrived at around 12.45 pm last Wednesday.  We were a group of 10 and we ordered a bunch of items from the menu. 8 of the 10 in the group were not vegans.  Overall, the food was great. It is organic to the extent possible and kudos to the owner for pricing it very reasonably.  I even purchased 3 different types of vegan cookie dough and loved that as well.  A must place if you are in the area.  Had a nice chat with the owner and appreciate his service.    I would be going again when in the area next time."}

Prior to our arrival we didn't know if Green was a sit-down or counter service.  Upon entering we found that it would be a counter service experience.  Nice and laid back. I immediately loved the flow of the restaurant with the painted wooden tables along with tree stumps for some of the seats.  Patio dining is available but the far end also has a see-through garage door that can be opened up for open air dining too.  Quick examination of the menu had me wanting everything.  It's so nice not to have to decipher which items are vegan and which ones aren't.  I settled on the Mexicali Burger.  However, when I went to order I noticed the special....The Big Wac.  What?!  This is what everyone has been talking about in the Green Facebook Group. You see, The Big Wac is basically the vegan version of the Big Mac.  It's not always available and absolutely everyone was raving about it.  I made the quick switch, ordered the Big Wac with fries and my husband ordered the Kung Pao bowl.  Did the Big Wac live up to the rave reviews? Yes, and more! Although I admit I was never a huge burger person even prior to going veg this may be one of the best burgers I've had in my life.  Seriously.  My husband's meal was also tasty but after a nibble of my burger he immediately wished he had gone for the Big Wac too. Partnered with the yummy thin fries I had the perfect meal.

I know nami has a free standing location but Green is close to where I live and the people there are always so nice! All I have to say is that if you've never had tsoynami, you have to try it. It's dairy free, and sooooooooo good. I'm not technically dairy free, but I do try to limit my intake of it - which is why nami is perfect! I'm a HUGE ice cream lover and would choose nami over any other frozen treat... it's that good! You choose your base (vanilla, chocolate, or swirl) and then choose what goes in it. They have many creations available on their menu. My go-to is vanilla banana cream pie, add peanut butter. I've been coming here for about 3 years now and it never gets old!"}

I'm not a huge fan of the mock meats but I found it to be ok. I wouldn't order it again but it wasn't bad. Their fries are very delicious and soaked in a layer of grease, which is probably why they taste sooo good.  The staff is always nice and helpful.

I've been patiently waiting to incorporate a visit to Green into my usually busy and brief stays in Phoenix. Today was the day and I was not let down. Started off with the buffalo wings and artichoke gratin. The wings and ranch dip were fantastic. The wing sauce itself was a true standout and the ranch was as about as authentic as a vegan version could be. The artichoke dip was ok but not stellar. It was a bit soupy and probably would make a better sauce than anything else. For the main, I had to go with the Big WAC. It was at this point that I found myself in vegan nirvana. My high hopes for this plant based version of the American fav were exceeded. It tasted somewhere between the Big Mac and In n Out Double Double that I enjoyed so much in my omni days. A carnivore could easily be deceived by the tastes and textures of this burger. Towards my last couple of bites I felt a strange sadness knowing that I would have to drive 100 miles to have this treat again. The fries were good but there was no trace of thyme on them which for a thyme lover, is kind of a let down. All in all, I suspected that I was going to love Green. And my suspicion was correct. I can see myself frequenting Phoenix much more often because of this gem of an eatery. And contrary to previous reviews, I did not witness a cooler than thou, hipster attitude from the staff. The girl at the counter was very friendly and patient and several employees came by the table to check up on us. Keeping my fingers crossed for a Tucson location down the road."}

Every bite was overwhelmingly unbearable.  If salty sea water is your thing, then this is your place to indulge.  The best thing about Green is the soy-based ice cream: but that's probably because it wasn't so salty as the rest of the menu.  Oh, and the food gave my friend the terrible runs.  Ouch!

I'm one of these people that can't stomach it. I prefer my meat and cheese and gluten and whatever else vegans cringe at. Not everyone is cut out to be a vegan. Some vegans I know of are kinda fat - they get this way because with the restrictive diet, they end up loading up on carbs eating nothing but chips and bread and candy and bean burritos and pasta. I'm not going to argue on how healthy or unhealthy this lifestyle is, but I'll say that the food at Green isn't diet food. It's rich and flavorful and a good. It's a perfect place to go if you're a couple and only one of you is vegan.  I dated a vegan once... I'm used to normally being the picky eater, but holy shit. We couldn't eat anywhere due to her diet restrictions and it was terribly annoying. Eventually, I got her eating burgers and steaks and real food again. Before that, of the few restaurants we were allowed to eat at - this was one of my favorites.   The menu is creative and there's something for everyone (unless you're allergic to veggies and tofu). I dare say my friend is a culinary genius and I suggest you all check out That's a Wrap (his other restaurant) as well."}

And god forbid a meal at mom and dad's goes by without someone making mention of your weird eating habits.   Its a good thing that Green came along to help strengthen our resolve. and more importantly, to help convince non-vegetarians that vegans and vegetarians aren't a bunch of weirdos who eat soy-paste and lentils all day.   With a wide array of options on their menu, Green has enough variety to please pretty much everyone, vegan or not.  After eating here at least twice a week for the last few months I've come close to sampling the entire menu, and there really isn't a bad thing that I can say about it.  The mock chicken and the phoney beef  used in Green's sammy's are alarmingly accurate in both flavor and texture.  The curry bowls are some of the best I've had, and the orecciette pasta with chicken  parmesan is worth killing for - which is saying a lot in vegan circles. Bottom line:  if you're in the neighborhood, you'd be a fool not to stop in and sample some of the items on the menu.  If you don't find something at green that you absolutely love, you may want to see a doctor, because there is a good chance that you are dead and haven't realized it yet. Finally, if the slew of rave reviews here on yelp hasn't convinced you yet, you can check out Green's menu right here:  http://www.greenvegetarian.com/menu.jpg"}

Me and Jon S. were meeting with someone before they caught a flight home the next day, and decided to meet over late night Tsoynamis. We arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and it was pretty poppin'. They place smells really good, and if I hadn't already had dinner plans I probably would have tried something off of the menu.   The guy at the register was nice, and I decided on the almond joy-esque tsoynami, with soy ice cream, almonds, chocolate syrup, and coconut. Jon had the pb&j and added vegan cap'n crunch. While we were all consumers of meat and dairy, the tsoynami's were super good. You get about 16oz of goodness, and after licking the cup clean, you don't feel weighed down as you might after eating the same amount of Cold Stone. This is definitely someplace I'd come back to, and may even be daring enough to try lunch or dinner :)"}

A lot of water and the ranch sauce from our wings helped to curb the spice. There is plenty of seating inside and outside, and the bathrooms are clean and gender neutral. There are also many vegan products for sale such as cookie dough, marshmallow fluff, and chocolate syrup. Truly a vegan paradise."}

The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the wait. The line was literally going out of the door onto the patio and they only had one person taking orders.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "My husband and I are vegetarians, and make a point of eating at local veg establishments when we travel. I was very excited when I saw the website for Green...it really looked intriguing.   We've been fortunate to have been able to dine in a lot of really, really, good vegan establishments, so we have pretty high expectations. The days when vegan meant bland, underseasoned, hippy cuisine are long past, or so we thought. I guess there are still some places out there that are stuck in the 70s...definitely Green fits that description.  I was a bit taken aback, after looking at the website and reading about Chef Damon's vision, to find myself in a tiny hole in the wall waiting in line for counter service, though I could have gotten past that had the food been stellar. I was further taken aback to discover that the place apparently doesn't have a liquor license...the only drink alternatives were bottled and cannned sodas from the cooler and a couple of fruity iced teas.  Still, if the food had been good...  I ordered something that isn't on the on-line menu. It was described as blackened faux chicken in a grilled pita with lettuce, tomato, and tahini. My husband ordered the Argentine Po'Boy with Thyme Fries. We also ordered some samosas to share. We both, reluctantly, grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler.  Almost immediately after we'd sat down, my sandwich and the order of samosas came out of the kitchen. We waited for a bit, thinking that surely my husband's sandwich would be along shortly, but after several minutes of waiting, tucked into the samosas. They were OK...not bad; nothing to write home about. To be honest, they tasted as if they'd come out of a freezer box. Any Indian restaurant can do them better, and if you don't absolutely have to be dairy free, that's where I'd recommend you go, if samosas are what you're craving.  The samosas consumed, we sat, and sat some more. My husband finally urged me to get started on my sandwich, which was rapidly cooling, and we both tried a bite of the faux chicken. It was, I have to say, really unpleasant. There was no sign of any blackening seasonings having been used...no sign of any seasoning at all, really. It had an oddly fishy taste to it (too much seaweed in the kombu, maybe?), and was much tougher than most chicken analogs. The pita (which was actually flatbread) didn't appear to have been grilled at all...it was dried out to the point of being crunchy, and there were no grill marks on it at all. The only real flavor in the sandwich (other than the odd, fishy, taste of the analog) came from the tahini. I finally gave up on the whole thing as not being worth the effort of chewing.  My husband's sandwich finally came out, well after I'd given up on mine. I took a bite of the faux beef, and it was OK. It reminded me of the faux beef strips you can buy at Trader Joes. The fries that came with were nicely crispy (shoestring style), but there was not even a hint of thyme about them. They'd do best to just call them French Fries and have done with it.  My take? If you're a vegetarian, you'd do better to eat at Lalibela. If you're a vegan...well, this place will keep you alive, but you'll pay more than it's worth and, if you're familiar with really good vegan cuisine, you won't be happy with it. If this is the best Scottsdale has to offer vegans, you're better off cooking at home."}

Cute, creative and not over the top.  Smelled good!  Staff was OK... We were both hesitant with the menu since neither of us had previously been there before and the girl behind the counter seemed to be a little impatient... certainly not rude but just not overly helpful.  I had the buffalo chicken po boy and the tyme fries.  It was OK... nothing fabulous.  Very messy... (who puts halfed cherry tomatoes on a sandwich???? they're just gonna pop out when you eat it!)  Apparently the cook had no time to add the tyme on the fries or salt for that matter... they were crispy and hot though so that's a plus.    My friend had the mexicali burger and coleslaw.  The burger had good flavor but way mushy and it was just the patty, sauce and bread... could definitely been improved by some lettuce to add a little crunch.  The slaw was bland... but once she added a little siracha to it was much better!     We did share a oatmeal cookie sandwhich which was very yummy.

Part of what makes or breaks an eating experience to me are the surroundings I find myself in. When I am surrounded by Scottsdale Reich Mommies serving their kids healthy deep fried tofu and praising its healthful benefits, my stomach begins to turn. When I am out numbered 3 to 1 by hipsters sporting the standard hipster uniform, and stench, in 110* heat, my fists begin to clench. When I wander about to the bathroom and every square inch of the open space is some sort of high minded yet unfounded preaching about the evils of meat, my blood begins to boil. When the parking lot is filled with grubby little rich skater punk kids from Scottsdale trying to be scenesters, I just see red and either have to leave or face assault charges. Fat little wannabe future rabble rousers sitting in the corner yelling so loudly at each other that you can tell that mom and dad never put their hand up side little baby precious's head is where my cool came undone. I had to leave.  And best of all, the true cherry on the shit sundae, was the vegan ouija board. That's just insulting to the point where I wanted to take it down, and then just wait for the first person to come up to give me shit so I could wrap the frame around their head.  I'm not about to catch a charge to eat at this bullshit festival.  But onto the food.  - Greasy - Unhealthy - cold - For some reason they removed the soda fountain, and yet they have all the bottled drinks there with just as much sugar as, if not more than, a coke. Sounds like this was done for profits, not health.  So why would I bother going here? I do this to indulge my girlfriend and her vegetarian family. But I don't think I can do it again after tonight.  I understand the benefits of the lifestyle, but when your lifestyle makes you look like nothing more than a bunch of over indulged white kids suffering from the white man's burden you need to reevaluate your whole thing.  The New Green over in Phoenix, on the other hand, does not cause the ire that this place does. From now on I will do all I can to deprive the Tempe Green of my money, and the money of anyone I associate with. Gotta vote with your dollar dollar bill y'all."}

I have also tried their wings, bowls, curries, and fries, and none of these have lived up to the standards that the burgers have set.  2. Tsoynamis- A must-have item! These soy-based ice creams are light, so Green serves you a very large amount with each order. They have a lot of different every-day flavors, as well as some seasonal ones on a board that they have. I highly recommend the Kissed by a rose flavor (rose, chocolate, strawberries) if that is up on the seasonal board.  3. Ambiance- Green is such a cute place to come grab lunch or a light snack. They are big supporters of local art, and have interchangeable art pieces on their walls that customers can buy. Everything has a sort of hipster-vibe to it, and with the natural light streaming in through their large windows, you will always leave the place feeling calmer and happier than when you came in.   Definitely recommend giving it a try!"}

Well honey, that was a year ago, or maybe a few months ago, BUT NOW that has all changed because they CHANGED THEIR MENU.  and its awful.  Long story short, Im a phx native, but I go to school out of state and I had always craved green when I was gone because I wanted GOOD vegan food, that the boca burger and salad crap. So after 14 weeks away I decide to order one of my two favorites and really the only two things i order other than a soynami or wings; the orcettee bowl with no harm chicken parm or the sweet and sour. SO I call to order to go and find out that both of these are NOT on the menu anymore and that they changed their menu literally days after I went back to school. SO , I CANCELED THE ENTIRE ORDER AND WENT SOME WHERE ELSE THAT DOESNT CHANGE THEIR MENU AND TAKE THE BEST THINGS OFF. aka pita jungle.  Literally I am so devastated that i decided to look up other responses to find that I wasn't the only one complaining and that they had changed other things on the menu as well as taken favorites off. They changed their delicious burgers to disgusting boca burgers, and added a bunch of salads.   SERIOUSLY. YOU ADDED BOCA BURGERS AND SALADS? AND TOOK OFF SOME OF THE BEST VEGAN FOOD IN THE WORLD? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I wont eat a boca burger if it was the last thing on earth. Im so sick of going to bbqs and being asked if i want a boca burger. NEXT thing is adding salads? REALLY? did you ever think that salads are really the only thing that vegans can eat at normal restaurants? and you decide to take the good food that vegans cant get anywhere else and replace it with the only thing we can eat.  WOW. THANKS FOR GOING FOR THE STEROTYPE  . VEGETARIAN = ONLY EATS SALADS? REALLY? WHAT ARE YOU GOIGN TO TAKE AWAY NEXT? THE WINGS? THE SOYNAMI? im getting out of there waaaaay before that happens. like maybe now. THANKS GREEN.  you hurt my feelings. :(   I honestly dont think i want to go back im so up set. In fact DONT GO. whats on the menu now is nothing compared to what it used to be.   THE POINT IS:  IF YOU HAD SOMETHING AMAZING WHY CHANGE IT?  if your going to add things to the menu dont take things away. the sweet and sour and the ocette pasta was literally the only thing i ever got there besides wings and a soynami and now what? you may call me stubborn but both of those were so good that all you ever wanted were those two items. If you have the ingredients why not put them back together to make something amazing?  so thanks green for making my homecoming suck because you changed your menu and made it horrible. MAYBE you should just Add on to the old menu and not completely wipe it off the face of the earth."}

There was a constant flow of customers in and out in the 2 hours were sat, ate and talked. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you; the line moved fast and the food was fast to come out of the kitchen piping hot  We started with the buffalo wings - the sauce was super flavorful and the dipping sauce was sooo good we ordered more to go with our meals  I had the Wendy Pickle - closest vegetarian Chik-Fil-A sandwich ever! It was so flavorful and the fries that came with it were great!  My husband had the Big Wac - vegetarian version of the Big Mac - he said it was amazing!  To finish it off we had the Dough Boy for dessert - YUM YUM YUM!!!  We cannot wait to go back :)"}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Well, that was pretty great. I've been to my share of vegan restaurants in my life having been vegetarian for 27 years and this one is definitely among the best.   It has a cool, hippie-hipster vibe that makes you wonder if you're in Seattle or Humboldt instead. Being a lover of all things PEACE, LOVE, and HAPPINESS, this place is totally my jam.  It's an order-at-the-counter place or what we all kind of dub as fast casual or whatever. You grab a drink from the case, some vegan cookie dough for later and order your food. They hand you a number and deliver to your table. They don't have fountain soda, but awesome, homemade juices that take the place. You can buy sodas though, just fancier ones in the bottle cooler case.  We had a variety of things--mock orange chicken with veggies and rice (good), egg rolls (a bit bland but fixed that with sriracha--would've been better stuffed with more crunchy veggies and glass noodles), thyme fries (yum), veggie burger (decent, topped with high quality stuff) and the favorite, fried Brussels Sprouts with lime. It was alllllll about those Brussels, people.   I am dreaming of those, honestly. I could eat a whole dinner of just those. Mmmmm.  Definitely see the appeal and for those crispy little mini cabbages, I'd come again and again."}

The calexico burger...omg. DO it!! Right now! The hummus is so flavorful and amazing. The burger itself is a little spicy, but perfectly seasoned. And for you usual meat lovers, I recommend the argentine po-boy. You won;t even notice there isn't meat in it. Trust me.  And save room for a soy-nami. Lots of room, these things are massive. Or share one, because after about 6-7 bites into it you might feel ready to explode. Yes, I know from personal experience."}

Their mock chicken wings are to die for, the mock crab puffs are seriously amazing, and their animal and thyme fries are delicious!  I will continue to cook at home, but it's nice to know if I ever need a vegan option for food it's available!   My only complaint is the f-ing line you have to wait in when you show up. Due to it being in Tempe and basically the only vegan place around that wait time was insane. I went in at 630 on a Friday and the line was out the door (literally) and I had phoned my order in at 6. It was done already, and I sat in that line for almost 20 minutes.   Also, the staff looked like they hated their jobs - not a single smile on any of their faces.   The food was worth it though! The quality of food was all in all pretty good.   Just make sure if you choose to go here to plan accordingly, this isn't somewhere you can show up for a quick bite to eat. There is a wait time, and the staff could give a sh!t less how long you wait.  I personally can get over that stuff for some good food (that I didn't have to cook myself), but I know others can't."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "We were visiting Phoenix and found Green by searching for vegetarian places on Yelp.  The reviews were excellent, and for good reason.  The food was fantastic, the art & decor was very cool, and the prices were great.  I highly recommend this place to anyone (vegetarian or carnivore).  As stated in other reviews, the staff is friendly.  When we arrived for dinner, they already closed the kitchen (since it was after 9 PM).  Not only did they let us stay, but they made us a large amount of food.  We started with the spicy peanut tofu and the samosas, both had excellent flavor.  For dinner we had the drunken mushroom chicken and the singapore tofu.  The food was delicious.  However, if I had to suggest one change for the entrees, I would have liked it if they used less salt.  Another thing that impressed me was their organic green tea was brewed perfectly (some restaurants mess up their green tea by steeping too long or too hot ... but not them, it was just right).  The decor was very cool and I like the amount of art they had around the place.  One of my favorite features were the tabletops and the design that they had inked on the tops of most of the wooden tables.  Very cool!  If they ever decide to sell tables like that, I would certainly get in line :-)"}

I had the delicious Green Burger at the Scottsdale location.  I don't know what they put in that burger but it satisfied my carnivore side.  There were many options for my side dish.  I had fresh fruit.  I have gone vegetarian two times.  Each time lasted about a year.  I just like the feeling of eating good food and not ending up a bloated beached whale.  Even after I shared a Chocolate Monsoon Soynami for dessert I could still walk out the door feeling good about what I put into my body.  The Soynamies rock by the way.  If a DQ Blizzard and a Soynami got in a taste test fight the Soynami would kick ass and take no prisoners.  Check out Green, even if you eat meat.  The food is excellent and good for you.  Go eat."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Amazing food. That simple. This from a non-vegan, non-vegetarian.    I was looking around at local restaurants and stumbled upon reviews for this place. I was shocked to find it was located so close to me, and figured I had to try it, that day. So I did; straight after work I stopped by.    From talking with a coworker, the decor inside apparently changes; when I went in I found it really pleasant. A little bit dimmer than I would have liked, but with strings of white Christmas lights strung up alongside the ceiling lights.     I did not eat in, but looking around, I think I'd feel comfortable doing so, everything looked clean and comfortable, very laidback, slight alternative vibe, but not to where I'd feel uncomfortable if I felt that wasn't me (it's not).    I ordered the thai peanut bowl with mock chicken, and the eggless rolls. The wait was on the order of 5, 10 minutes, nothing bad at all. As I waited, I noticed the bottled drinks...they have Cricket cola. Yes. Next time, I'm taking one home with me. I've been jonesing for Cricket cola for a while now.    Taking the food home I tucked in almost immediately. The thai peanut bowl was very good; filling and tasty. The mock chicken was clearly not chicken, but I didn't mind, it still was good. If you want something a little different, or are avoiding meat, yeah, this is as good as you're gonna get.    The eggless rolls though...to. die. for. They had a note of sweetness to them that moved them from being 'vegan knockoffs' to something wholly unique and delicious. I could see myself purposefully choosing these on their own merits, rather than as a vegan alternative to a real eggroll. I did not expect that from vegan food.    If you're vegan, vegetarian, or just want to try something different, this is definitely an excellent choice."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "... Apologies, I was just daydreaming about the Green Burger.  If I could suggest to a meat-eater a place for them to experiment with eating like a veg, no doubt this would be the place.  If I could suggest to a veg a place to have a mouth-gasm, no doubt this would be the place.  Ok, now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk food. They have delicious salads, and was look like good personal-pan style pizzas. I'm a fan of the huge, size-of-your-face pizza slice persuasion, so I've never gone that route at Green.  Regardless, I would be willing to slap a $5 down on the table in front of someone at Green, and if they didn't like the food, they could take it and walk.  Their tofu/mock-chicken/mock-beef/mock-pork bowls are yum, yum, yum. I stick with the Singapore tofu, and it never fails to make my stomach smile.  And their tsoynamis are oh-so good. No, that's not a mistake, people. It's a soy Dairy-Queen-blizzard style cup full of sunshine. EVERY one I've tried has blown me away. Some I like better, but I can't judge. It's sweet. It's soy. It's goooood.  Sometimes when it's lunch time, or a busy Friday or Saturday night, this place can get packed. It's usually full of the hipster and indie kinds of people, but, that shouldn't in any way make you not want to eat there, especially if you don't look this way. Eff all of that, go for the food if nothing else.  Service is always spot on, and they're always keen to help you decide or answer questions.  If you want a good, entertaining view of all the fixie-riders (there's a bike shop next door, no lies!), albeit simply amazing food, I'm going to say go here.  P.s. The ladies bathroom has a cool piece of artwork hanging on the wall and an even cooler faucet fixture for the sink. P.p.s. The artwork in this place is beyond bitchin'."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I am not a Vegan, nor am I a vegetarian. I tried this lifestyle in my early 20's and I just couldn't be faithful. I love meat way too much. That doesn't mean I won't accept alternatives here and there. I felt somewhat healthier as a vegetarian and do enjoy eating like one once in a while. So yesterday I tried Green.. Now let me just say, a lot of places I have tried like this have been seriously disappointing. Either it tastes like hydrogenated dog shit or looks like it.. and I once found a rubber band in my Black-eyed Pea Cake at Blossom, but we'll save that story for another review.. Green however, did not disappoint.   Edamame to start, because I am a super fan of it and eat it whenever possible.. I like that they served it with lime. Something I had never thought to add, but it was a nice touch. Then I had the Apricot Miso with mock chicken and pan fried noodles. Certainly an interesting dish, with a stir fry type mix of pineapple, dried apricots, sliced apples, broccoli and some other vegetables, in a sweet yet kinda spicy sauce which was really good. My buddy had the Original G spicy Po boy, and it was also tasty. You could barely tell the difference between real and mock, which is hard to do. The interior is super cute and funky. I liked that, but there was absolutely no where to sit, so we went outside and sat in the shade, which wasn't too terrible.. also a good sign that summer is ending sooner than later.   One complaint I do have... bring your own fork! I know it sounds silly but they only have forks carved out of wood, which break upon entering pretty much anything I tried to use it for. .   Definitely try Green. Vege or not, its worth a visit."}

Careful friends, it is easy to drive right by here. It is located in a dowdy looking gray strip mall... but oh-so-conviently next to a bike shop.   There are a few mock foods here, but gooooooooooood mock foods. The wings are really tasty. But, they were voted for the best mock chicken in the valley a couple years back.   Meat eaters, do not be afraid. This place is delicious. Whether you're feeling adventurous or just wanting something light... you cold definitely find something really great and satisfying here."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "I am the reigning Duke here so clearly I love Green. However, I'm writing an updated review because Green has changed. They still get 5 stars for being all vegan, having convenient locations, green practices, friendly staff, and a mostly good menu.   They recently changed their menu and removed the noodles, fettuccine Alfredo and pesto sauces and consolidated their salad, rice bowl, and sandwich options, and made a few other changes. They no longer have a small salad, just large for about $10, but what if you just want a side salad? Not an option. Sides like coleslaw are now only al la carte instead of automatically coming with the sandwiches - not a big deal, but if you're a hungry guy you'll need more food than just a sandwich. Other than the Karma Curry, their rice bowls (Thai Peanut, Singapore Orange, and Sesame Dragon) all kind of taste the same now - like a mixture of soy sauce and sriracha and the sauce is heavy. Overall there's fewer options and we miss some of our old favs.   Plus, on and off for about a year (not related to menu changes) their tofu has had a funny taste. I mentioned it to them and they said they were experimenting. It hasn't gotten better. And it's not consistently bad so it makes me wonder if it's sometimes spoiled or they are miss-handling it. It tastes and smells like mothballs. I only get fresh/steamed tofu so maybe the fried tofu loses the mothball flavor. If you get the fresh and it happens to be one of these off batches I speak of, you will know. It's so bad I spit it out and then pick out the rest and swear I'm done with these tofu defilers. But then I order it again and hope someone else has complained and they've fixed it.   Our favs now are the Ranchero salad with wing sauce instead of BBQ sauce, Wendy's Pickle, Tahini Coleslaw, Dagobah Jungle (as a wrap versus salad), Chili, Thee Fighting Artichoke salad, and of course their Nami treats like Tsoynamis (dairy free blizzards), cookies, and cupcakes. The salads are fresh and the sandwiches are consistently good.  Like I said in the last review, the staff seem to like their jobs and they get our take-out orders right almost EVERY time, which is amazing, and there's never any accidental cheese or meat in our food. But with fewer menu options to mix things up we definitely don't eat here as often and I expect to lose my crown."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I was really happy to find another vegetarian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  My wife and I enjoy Loving Hut, but it's always nice to find more variety.  We entered Green with high expectations considering the good reviews we saw here on Yelp.  I ordered a veggie burger (of course), my wife got a meatball po' boy, and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type.  There were also some appetizers such as egg(less) rolls, and their chili fries.  Chili fries--I looked forward with great anticipation to these, and it looks like I expected too much.  What passes for chili fries here are shoestring potatoes lightly sprinkled with thyme (not bad in themselves) which are then covered with a concoction of what appears to be Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles mixed with tomato sauce and one or two spices which I couldn't identify.  It was really not all that good.  It tasted like someone was trying to doctor up veggie crumbles and really didn't know how.  I'll say this much--it wasn't chili in any capacity that I would recognize.  In terms of the burger, I think that, at least at first, they did a good job of masking the blandness of the the red bean patty at the center.  The presentation and appearance was pretty nice.  However, by the time I took my last few bites, I was needing to wash it down with my Diet Coke.  Again, it was a not very successful attempt to make a meatless food attractive, hip, and tasty.  You can do it if you know how.  I'm not sure if the folks in the kitchen at Green really have a handle on it.  My wife's po'boy was a similar story.  Again, looked like Morningstar Farms meatless meatballs.  They put them in a bun with mum's sauce and soy cheese.  I tried a bite.  Tasted like a meatless meatball coated in ketchup on a bun.  The egg(less) rolls were. . .okay.  Again, there was something missing in the flavor.  The atmosphere was hip and cool.  The bathrooms were actually really neat looking.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The food was eh.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because they put up this big presentation and say with fanfare WE'RE VEGAN! means that the food here is good.  It's really mediocre and the only thing preventing it from being one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor, atmosphere, and service.  If you want to come here with a friend, share a basket of thyme fries or a dessert, you probably won't be disappointed.  If you want a great meatless meal in the Phoenix area, however, the Supreme Master Ching-Hai has the lock on it."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "I have been to Green many times and didn't write a review, but they have been helpful for me so I wanted to make sure to help others.  First of all, this restaurant is 100 percent vegan (although it's called Green Vegetarian).  I don't go to green when I want to have a salad or cold sandwich because I can make that at home.  This place serves delicious comfort food.  By comfort, I don't mean greasy or fattening, but don't go here if you're calorie conscious.  This is a great place to take friends and family who are not vegan or vegetarian because the food tastes so normal.  Green has the best mock chicken and mock beef I have ever had anywhere in the country (so far).  All of the sandwiches/burgers are to die for.  The thyme fries are great but if you want to keep it on the healthier side, go for the tahini coleslaw as a side option--it may be my favorite dish at Green.  Before I was vegan--more than five years ago--I didn't care for chicken wings but after years of watching other people scarf tens at a time, I grew a desire for them.  I have ordered them in bulk and meat lovers cannot taste the difference.  They are delicious and served with cucumber ranch and veggies.  I think I misspoke when I said the tahini slaw was my fave because I think this one might be it.  I've had the samosas and couldn't tell you anything good (or bad) about them.  They just left me with no impression.  The bowls are good but simple.  I feel like I can get similar dishes at other places so I would rather have something more exciting.  But if you're in the mood for something like that with the delicious mock meats, go for one of these.   I usually go to Green for its specials, which are posted on Facebook. They've been some of my favorite dishes and are usually delicious!   I have yet to try a dessert because I'm always full when I leave but make sure to try one of the tsoynamis.  They are light and a perfect end to a great meal.  I always get the almond oy vey and substitute the chocolate with bananas. Nom.

She had the Drunken Mushroom Noodle Bowl and yes WE SCORED! (she doesn't like food in US in general) so this was a great choice, not spicy, not just meat and carbs, and not overpriced.  My friend had the Singapore Tofu Noodle Bowl and was delighted. And I had the  Argentine Po-Boy, YUM!! it almost taste like tender beef! though I was not able to perceive the chimichurri ... To finish we had a vegan double (or was it triple) chocolate slice. Happy ladies after that!!!  Staff is really friendly and service is great despite the demand they have. I would join their carnivore caravan if I were around. For sure a lot of hard core carnivore could consider reducing their intake.

I live in north phx, so green is a little further away from me, but it is totally worth the drive.   I've tried basically everything on the menu but my favorite dishes have to be the secret chicken BBQ sandwich and the spicy buffalo wings. I used to eat meat but for the past 5 years I have been a vegetarian. I used to miss meat but after I found Green, I stopped having a craving to eat meat. Actually the food at Green is SO MUCH better than any other meats I've had.   My best friend is a full on meat lover, but one day I made her come with me to Green. She was a little skeptical at first but to her surprise she absolutely loved it. So even if you aren't a vegan or vegetarian, this is a must try.  oh and a little side note, the service is so amazing. The employees are so nice and caring. You can tell they really love their job. Also everything inside the restaurant is recyclable stuff.. so it is pretty interesting to look around the place while you are waiting for your food."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ Chicken sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.  The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.  Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.  Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. Turkey, stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend."}

The fact that you are writing a 1 star review and calling the new menu awful when you clearly said you haven't been in to try anything yet negates the trustworthiness of your entire review.   I go here a couple times a week so I have familarized myself with the new menu. First of all 75% of the menu is THE SAME. They got rid of the items that were boring and unpopular, except for the Green Burger which I do miss. You're sad about the sweet and sour being gone? Why don't you try something with actual flavor? The Singapore Orange and the Thai Peanut are delish, not to mention the same format as your beloved bowl just with a different sauce. And the Lemon Pesto and Alfredo bowls they added are sooo good.   Green does NOT use Boca patties, and it is petty to spread misinformation like that, especially when you are going off of secondhand accounts. They hand make their patties like always, they just make them in a different way. The Big WAC is a heavenly creature btw, so maybe try that before you continue whining.  And if my memory serves, they added ONE salad. If you look online, you can see they have six salads now. Six. Hardly contributing to the vegan stereotype. If you continue using your math skills, they have ten starters that are not salads (including the buffalo wings), eight different kinds of bowls, nine sandwiches, plus mac and cheese and their specials which always taste good. The majority of the menu is not salads, so you can quit your raging. Good riddance.  Green, lots of people love you, the new menu, and what you do for the Phoenix community. Please keep up the great work and ignore immature people throwing temper tantrums."}

Maybe slit my wrists and hop into a nice warm bath for dessert. I come here for fake meat that tastes like angel tears. The only thing they're missing is a liquor license.

I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but I do not eat dairy due to a major intolerance to it.  I went today for my second visit. Everything is fried, fried and fried. Why so much grease? Why can't vegan also be healthy?  Today I got the Jerk Tofu Salad. It was just ok. It was some greens mixed with carrots (the pre-shredded kind from a package) mixed with an equal amount of these fried stick things. The tofu was fried. Jerk spiced house tofu doesn't scream deep-fat fried to me, but apparently I am wrong. The carrots weren't fresh. The dressing wasn't my fav. I even asked for a different kind, and I got some lemon stuff. It was alright, but nothing to write home about.   I've made better dressings at home with just a few easy ingredients. This was not a $9 salad. Not even close. I could make a better vegan salad out of the produce section at Trader Joe's. It would be fresher. Would a few vegetables kill them? Seriously. Geez.   Last time I went we got a few starters - crab puffs and some hummus. I found them both alright, but they were VERY garlicky. Like major garlic. EEeks. I like garlic, but let's get real here. I got the Green burger for my meal last time. It was ok. It felt very heavy and gloopy for lack of a better word. I don't understand why they have to put the ketchup on the burger for me. So strange. I got the pasta salad as my side -- the server's suggestion as her favorite. Well, I guess if you like heavy, mayo covered stuff you are in luck.   I would go back but only for the soynami. I got the chunky monkey once and it was good.  The only upside is that I can go here and order anything without having to worry about dairy, which I am very allergic to. So, I guess that's worth something.  But in short...I've seen more veggies in a Wendy's 99 cent side salad. Seriously.  The other poster who said grease with a side of fat is dead on the money. I think I need an oil change after that tofu. :P"}

We also split the samosas which I wasn't as wild about.  I was expecting spicy Indian chutney type of samosas but instead, these were more sweet (picture apple turnovers) Middle Eastern type of somosas.  Not bad but not what I was hoping for.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant.   I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.   So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:  *Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.  *Spicy Buffalo Wings: first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the wings. This dish is a must try!!  *Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.  *Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!  Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.   Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving meat and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.    Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date."}

Prices are a tad high, but not really for being in Scottsdale, and for the unique kind of food they offer.  I will give two criticisms. First, I often go with my non-vegetarian wife, and I will have to say their choice of foods for her is very limited.  I'm not saying they should offer non-vegan foods, but I'm saying they could add a few more normal non-meat choices.  Maybe a few more salads, a veggie pizza, etc.  She had the Mac & Cheese which is something that might attract someone like my wife, and even I will have to say, it wasn't very good.   Second, the cleanliness of the place, and the overall feeling of the place could be improved.   While there seems to be all types inside, and it has a distinctive hippy vibe. If you don't have a nose ring and dreadlocks it gets easy to feel out-of-place, which is a shame because the food is very good.  Still, I do feel they should invest a bit more time in atmosphere improvements.  I know my food doesn't contain cows or pigs, but I'd like a bit more confidence that it doesn't include bug parts."}

The TSoynami Clunky Monkey was a dessert that I couldn't stop moaning after every bite! Was that TMI?? Just imagine... Soy Ice Cream mixed with chunks of bananas, pecans, and chocolate drizzled throughout. Even if you eat too much and think you don't have room... don't miss this chance - make room!! You won't be sorry.  Overall? Excellent!  I am a fan and can't wait to try more on the menu!"}

They also sell vegan products like fake cheese, cookies, grains, etc. You don't have a server, you order at the counter, get a number and someone brings out your food. They do have a tip jar at the counter. TIP THE STAFF! They are all nice and friendly there and will help you if you're stuck figuring out what to get. I've never been disappointed. I've gone many times when I lived in Phoenix and made a point to go back on a recent visit. Will eat here every time I'm in town.  The actual place: The vibe inside is casual and low key.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Kudos for offering tasty vegan delights and meat alternatives to satisfy that occasional craving. However, the food here is quite greasy and not necessarily healthy. I ordered the Argentinian Po Boy and it was drenched in oil. The beef seitan was literally dripping in fat, and the peppers and onions were stir fried in far more fat than necessary. I also ordered the spicy peanut chicken seitan salad. The greens could have come out of a bag, the chicken seitan was oily beyond imagination, and the dressings were 99% oil.  The single dollar sign price rating is misleading. This place is EXPENSIVE because the portions are very small. You would expect a Po Boy to come on a decently sized bun, however what I received looked smaller than a basic hot dog bun. It tasted great, but the portion size and high fat content made for disappointment.   While I am a vegan, I eat a very low fat and healthy vegan diet. Although tasty, the food here is prepared with an obvious disregard to basic dietary common sense. Don't come here thinking you are eating healthy - you are not. However, on those occasions when you want a greasy meal without the meat guilt, this is your place. I would not recommend eating here on a regular basis unless you are prepared to ingest a lot of vegetable oil with its negative consequences.  To the owner and chef - why don't you offer a healthy, low fat menu to those of us who don't want our vegan meal to contain more fat than a quarter pounder with cheese and fries? There isn't even an option for low fat salad dressings. I fear for those who come here thinking they are eating a healthy meal. Vegan /= healthy here.   Why three stars? Because I enjoy this place on those occasions when I want a greasy fix without having to eat meat or patronize an evil fast food chain restaurant."}

I enjoyed house made lime drink, and then soft served nice cream.   Overall, place was well worth my stop, prices are fair.   Its also a very busy place.

Luckily my Dad was wiling to run out and grab some, but of course he brought back styrofoam instead of the compostable plates I would have preferred. But really he had no options on such short notice.   The other downside was that the sauces for the chicken wing and the salad were not labeled, so there was some confusion on our guests part as to what sauce went with what.

And you will walk away full and liking the meal you just had!  After checking out the menu, I went with Thai Peanut bowl, right of the bat I knew I loved spicy peanut sauces, so this was up my alley, and it comes with pan fried noodles (you can get rice too if that's your thing) sautéed veggies and I picked mock chicken to go with mine, but since I wasn't sure if I would like the mock chicken, I asked for it on the side.  When the dish arrived, it looked like a great stir-fry bowl, it didn't scream vegan at all.  The mock chicken, to me looked like and had the texture of chicken nuggets, but were better tasting, I was kind of disappointed I asked for them on the side, instead of the dish so they could get saucy,  but next time I'll know.  This was a great meal, everything tasted great including the mock chicken. Glad to have tried Green, I also like that Green is Vegan restaurant that offers comfort food.

Personally, I'd prefer to stay away from meat substitutes so I got my dish with tofu.  I had the Thai peanut with the tofu (fried not soft).  It was a nice serving of vegetables with a strong peanut sauce with a bit of spice.  Not that much spice so unless you can't take anything, you will be able to eat it.

I've been surrounded by them (to my dismay) for years, and can spot one from a mile away. One of my favorite youtube videos of all time is The Dickhead Song which is completely, 100% making fun of hipsters.  That being said, I personally think the environment is cute and sort of catchy. Definitely won me over when I walked in the door and saw that they recycle. Yes! Thank you god, finally an establishment around that serves plastic cups but promotes and WANTS you to recycle.  Also, a couple of people said something about the people working there not being attentive and being extremely rude. I'm going to guess that the yelper themselves were in a really bad mood or had a one time bad experience because when I walked up they were nothing but sweet as pie and incredibly attentive. They talked with me about the different options and explained the menu to me.   Refills are free. That's pretty awesome, especially considering their lemonade is killer. After we sat down we probably waited 5-7 minutes and our food was out. Nice. My partner and I decided to share their Drunken Mushroom bowl. Needless to say, the bowl was definitely big enough for two. We still ended up leaving with leftovers. And let me tell you, the food was excellent. The veggies were crispy. Crispy! They didn't over-cook them. Thank you! And the faux-chicken was indeed splendid. Pulls apart and basically melts in your mouth. The sauce was so good. So so good. I have dreams of this particular dish (and I'm not even fibbing one bit).  I also had a cone of their plain vanilla ice cream. It was good. Definitely not the most amazing soy ice cream I've ever had, but it isn't something I'd turn my nose up at and would definitely get it again next time I go there (...maybe tomorrow?).  I can definitely say that Damon has found himself a masterpiece of a vegan restaurant. Don't pay so much attention to the negative reviews.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I've eaten here twice. I appreciate somewhere where I can go and get a meal with some green vegetables that are more than just the garnish and also have some vegan options. My first meal I got a rice bowl and I enjoyed that although it was a little spicy or than I had expected. I realize the description said spicy garlic but I assume the spicy meant the garlic and not the red chili pepper that was also in there. I kept reading about the thyme fries so and my second visit I decided to take the leap and order the fries which is rare for me. I also ordered the peanut bowl gluten free option. The fries were a huge disappointment. I ordered them as a treat, I eat fries once or twice a year. I have no idea what is so special about these fries. There was never a hint of thyme flavor and it's certainly wasn't visually observable. They were just regular fries, nothing special at all, a little greasy and their ketchup tasted weird. The peanut bowl was okay. I'm pretty sure they're fake chicken is deep fried. In my opinion its a wash as far as vegan chicken that's fried vs regular chicken breast as long as its raised properly. If I return to the area in the future I might stop in but I think there's very little on the menu for me and if you want to stick with healthier food you need to order carefully here. The food arrived super fast, a little too fast as I like to wash my hands before I eat. I had no sooner ordered and gotten some water and the fries were on the table.

He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...vote with your feet...but I guess that's another review.  The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!  At the very tippy top of the near and dear list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.  Whit is a Vegan...with a capital Vege...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.  So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!  I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!  I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!  We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!  Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!  The big question about Green is why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?  I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.  I like to fit in.  The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.  I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).  I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!

The ambiance is retro and laid back, perfect for both hipsters (we have plenty of those in LA) and families. The staff is as unique and inviting as the ambiance. Our meals were delivered within minutes (for real) of us ordering, even though it was lunch time on a Saturday!   Now here's the best part, the food is AWESOME.

Green is a testament that vegan/vegetarian meals don't have to consist of just a plate full of side dish vegetables. the prices are extremely reasonable and the interior decor is kind of like that kitsh-industrial-hippy look. customers order at the counter and the food is brought out quickly, and you self-serve drinks so the water glass is always full!"}

The reason, so many tempting items, I usually just t need to decide between the fish or veggie dish, but here every dish is a veggie dish.  We started our meal with fake crab puffs and samosas.  The crab puffs were great, crispy garlicky and for having no cheese egg or crab lacked nothing. The plate of puffs came with a thimble of sweet dipping sauce, and there were 5 puffs for $3.  The plate of 3 samaos for $4 were not as impressive, there was too much cumin giving it a cinnamon taste, the warper was crisp and not greasy.  For my meal I went with the Thai peanut mock beef with brown rice. $7.50 I was happy to have brown rice as a standard option. The bowl while small had fresh crisp veggies, the sauce was a bit weak but the mock beef was interesting in flavor and texture.  It is order at the counter and they bring it to you style, they have a stage   so it may not be a great for a intimate chat. there is some couch and patio seating.  For drinks there is fountain and new age soda options.  If you are a veggie or follow similar dietary restrictions (halal kosher vegan budist monk etc..) give this place a try"}

Same with all the other sides.   If you are a vegetarian for health reasons, don't even think about this place. The only items that are remotely healthy are 2 of the salads, both of which don't have mock meats (which are all deep fried BTW). But, why go out for that when you can make it at home?   The burgers are mushy. The no harm chicken parm was seriously barely any mock meat-mostly fried breading with oily vegan cheese. Again, good if you don't care about health but..... seriously? Blech. I'm a steak fry kinda girl, so their fries blow IMO.  The tahini coleslaw, however, is fantastic. I could eat buckets of it but it's a side, so for $3, you get a measly serving of cabbage. Lame.   Dessert sizes (which exception of tsoynamis) are pathetic. $3 for that tiny peanut butter bar? Again, lame LOL.

I take a bite only to have oily sauce come pouring out the backside. If this was a no oil sandwich I would hate to see what a normal one looked like. Regardless I don't think they actually were concerned with my issues eating oils and could have just made it like normal. I got the chili as a side. It was awful!! It tasted like meatless crumbles with taco seasoning on them. I took two bites and left it.  My boyfriend got their burger which was pretty good (I snuck a bite) with thyme fries which had no seasoned taste whatsoever. Very bland!!!  For a $30 lunch I am beyond disappointed!!!!"}

I decided to order the Moo-shroom BBQ Po-Boy sandwich, which consisted of sliced portobello slathered in sweet and tasty barbeque sauce. It came with a side of house cole slaw made with a hint of peanut butter to enhance the flavor. Both were VERY good.  Green doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is an entirely different story. All of the walls are covered with really cool recycled art i.e. old, painted VW hubcaps, menus cut up and made to look like birds flying through plastic grocery bag clouds, etc. You really just have to see it. The bottom line is, you get a strong vibe of responsibility for what you put into your body as well as the greater environment.

Just recently they had a great turkey pesto sandwhich which sounds kind of ordinary, but it was way better than anything I can make at home. Their taco special with mock shredded beef was killer. They even have a Big Wac if you miss that nasty burger from McDonald's.  My favorite dishes are the No Harm Chicken Parm and Meatball sandwich. Their marinara is so flavorful! Lots of garlic, just how I like it. When I lived 10 minutes away and got take out, I could barely keep myself from eating while I was driving because it smelled sooooo good.

My first time here was great because I went with a group and got to try bites of a variety of items. The hummus is my fave. It's got  a bit of a spice which I love and comes with deep fried pita (sometimes a bit too greasy, but I can deal). The artichoke appetizer is delish, but not anything like a traditional, so I wouldn't expect that. The salads are really yummy, I can't remember which ones I've tried, so I can't specify which are best. And today, I tasted heaven in the form of a tater tot. They just introduced sweet potato puffs and they are incredible. I will be getting these as a side every time now! And then there's the tsoynami. Most incredible frozen treat ever. I get the betterfinger with no choco chips, add peanut butter and double chicostix (sp?) SOOOOOO good words can't describe.  I love it here so much that I make the trek from Ahwatukee to Scottsdale for lunch, salivating in anticipation, just to please my pallet a few times per month and it is worth every mile.   As mentioned in just about every review, the staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to make a recommendation if you ask. One time, when there was a mishap with my office's order that caused me to wait an extended period of time for pick up, I got a call upon returning to work from the manager with a personal apology.

Most of the food, I've tried here is good, but I will always order the same thing if I go.  The eggless rolls are nice and crispy, even if they are always very greasy.  I also love the no harm chicken parm.  The cheese is really sharp and the marinara is kinda tart and goes nicely with the chicken and the cheese.  Their chili fries are amazing, and you would never know that there wasn't meat in it.      I've tried a few of the bowls, stir-fries, etc.  They're good but not great, and nothing I would go there specifically for.  The sandwiches are where its at.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I agree with Monica J's review. My wife and I sought out Green while vacationing in Phoenix. We seek out healthy and real food places to eat everywhere we go. While Green's offerings are substantially healthier, they use a lot of sugar/sweeteners in their menu. Some items are rather small for the price. I had their special of the day which was street tacos. 3 small tacos with not a lot of anything in them. If they had filled them with a bit more cabbage and thrown some fresh salsa on them, they would have appeared larger and less like airplane food. The tacos came with a side of fries. Interested in how they did their meatless chili, I ordered them with some of their chili on top. While the fries were cold and not very fresh, the chili was to die for! The rice bowls that other customers ordered looked very substantial and appealing, probably the better choice for next time. We tried a couple of the tofu soft serve for desert. Interesting and a great substitute for ice cream, but still loaded with sugar. I too would like to be able to see the actual ingredients and nutritional values for their menu items. But, I imagine that they wouldn't be much healthier than other fast foods.   So, for a vegetarian or vegan alternative, I'd give them 5 stars. For a real food, low carb, or sugar free choice, 2 stars. For the amount you get vs. the price you pay on some of their menu items, 2 stars. The atmosphere and service levels were great. I'd score them 5 stars here, but the Homiez artwork was weird and didn't fit with the rest of the motif, so 4 stars."}

I might consider one of their rice dishes, but nothing else. The sandwiches are  extremely greasy. I've had the original g spicy po-boy, which is a buffalo chicken sandwich with some faux meat. It just tasted like grease and buffalo sauce. I got the chicago cheesesteak on another occasion to try out their seitan, and it was just a greasy mess too...greasier than the real thing. I've also had the chicken nuggs and the texture leaves a lot to be desired and is quite flavourless. I think I need to try something without the faux meats and stick to tofu or just veggies to get a good meal there. I'll probably give them one more chance for lunch by getting a rice bowl and maybe update my review at that time if it improves my impression of their food.   I have come here for tsoynamis, and they aren't that consistent with making them. I usually get more than one, and one usually has noticeably more dessert than the other. I wish they were more consistent with these.   The pastries are a bit pricey, so I haven't tried any of those. I bought one of those really dark energy bars though, with the semolina and stuff in it. I didn't like it at all. It was way too sweet and the texture was off. I wouldn't spend my money on it again.   It's nice to have a vegan place in the metro area, but besides the tsoynamis, there are better options for a good healthy vegan meal."}

Really the only reason I can't get myself to give 5 stars is because of their prices...they are a little high for my taste but is not enough to deter me from returning!"}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Ah, what more can be said about this little slice of Heaven in North Tempe? Well, let me offer something from a new perspective: I am a conservative Republican Catholic and I love Green!  I often like to come here after work. It is right in the middle of my 2.2 mile commute, and so I can easily walk here, eat, and walk to the next bus stop. So if you see me in my work uniform - I work at a Catholic parish - you will know that I think it is worth the walk.  I especially enjoy coming here on Fridays, when I abstain from meat. Now I could be somewhere eating seafood or dairy or eggs, but I choose Green because the food is just that good. My motto? Hippies have the best food! Restaurants usually try to be apolitical. The key to a good restaurant is mostly in not offending anyone's ideologies. Green's decor and ambiance is clearly quirky and off-beat and appeals mostly to young hipsters, but you can tell that the only politics important here are kindness to animals and care for the environment. I can get behind these things!  I have been here many times now. It is becoming even more of a regular thing as I get used to the three-block walk in between buses. I have tried various dishes and they're all fantastic. Some of the best are the Lemon Pesto Bowl and the Chili Fries with Cheese. I have also had Edamame, Samosas, and No Harm Chicken Parm, all great. Once I had a mock burger that was weird and would've been sub-standard even for Jack in the Box. But I'm happy to ignore the outliers when the rest is delish. Lately I have quite enjoyed my share of Vanilla Almond Milk Shakes. I am sure these have more than a few calories but it's definitely a refreshing treat on a hot day. And the portion isn't huge, so I don't feel that guilty about indulging.  The price is right! Everything is so reasonable, and the servers are super-friendly and nice. An especially nice feature is a big fridge full of interesting drinks, none of which I've ever tried, not to mention the fresh-mixed juices and ades on the counter. Also there is an impulse-buy set of shelves for things to take home, all of which are full of vegetarian goodness.  If you're in doubt about what to get, try my favorite. The Lemon Pesto Bowl with House Tofu and Brown Rice. You really can't go wrong. The walnuts in here are a special treat. Plenty of mixed veggies in a delectable tart lemon sauce. I like to break out the chopsticks for this one. Also, don't miss the Tsoynamis, a soft-serve treat that is also refreshing on a hot day. I tried one once and it was wonderful. But being on a diet, I shy away from sugary creamy frozen treats as a matter of course. It's not for me but perhaps it is for you!  I am known for my ability to eat just about anywhere a bus stops. I adamantly refuse to go out of my way to eat - that's why when I'm at home on my day off, I am likely to order delivery food or, in a pinch, I might walk one block to a restaurant. Green is so conveniently placed on my commute, and so delicious, that it has rightly taken its place among my regular hangouts. And I am proud to recommend them to other conservatives. Don't let your politics keep you away from really great food!"}

Also, both of my friends didn't feel well after eating at Green either. All of us just felt so bloated and unwell after our meal. Is it normal for a carnivore to feel this way?   My husband got the Mexi-Cali burger. The meat didn't hold together and seemed like mush....which means the texture wasn't appetizing. The vegan cheese on that thing was NOT good.   I got the steak po-boy. It was really more like a philly cheesesteak without the cheese.   Our friend got the peanut curry noodles. He liked the first few bites.

The chili is super flavorful (albeit really salty, but I don't mind that!) and the fries are super thin, which I love! The tacos are also pretty good. They are surprisingly filling for only being $2.95 each. As a vegetarian who still eats cheese and dairy, I'm not really accustomed to things like fake cheese and ranch, but I've been impressed so far!   They also have ice cream! I'd never actually had vegan ice cream before this but I love it. It's not as creamy as regular ice cream but the flavor is just as good. The soft serve has a mild coconut flavor to it and they have a wide variety of toppings you can mix in.

I was a little worried about the mock chicken not being gluten free and the girl who worked there said she thinks it's gluten free.

All good.  The po' boy was a little hard to eat - very messy, but tasty nonetheless (it's supposed to be messy, right?). The burger is a reddish color (they must use beet juice) and tastes like grains and savoriness and is texturally soft and pleasing, on a nice big bun with all the right fixins. Thyme fries could use a little more thyme, but the fries themselves were quite good. Tsoynamis and milkshakes are AMAZING. Bowls with noodles and fried tofu are great. Thai peanut = win.  It has a nice, diverse menu - can't wait to try out some of the appetizers :)  One thing I didn't like was that there was a lot of fake meat on the menu - fake chicken, fake beef, etc. I'm not into the fake meat so much, give me something homemade or tofu any day. Fortunately, there was plenty of that too, and some people like fake meat, so who am I to judge?

With that out there, today I had lunch at Green with some coworkers and I was really looking forward to the experience. Time was short so we did pick up and I ordered chili with a side of tahini coleslaw. $8. Eight bucks for 2 tiny little side containers (see pictures ... taken before a spoon or fork ever touched the food ... They did not even FILL the little cup of freakin chili) most other restaurants would use these for sides of dressing . I actually thought they were joking when they brought it out. The taste is okay .... Nothing fancy nor exceptional .... The chili was pretty salty ... And cold....and when I ordered the tahini slaw I assumed it would be garlicky and creamy but this is pasty and tastes vaguely of peanut butter. If I had half a brain I would have asked for my money back but I think I was still in sticker shock. The place was overly warm and dingy so I was glad to miss that dining experience. However My coworkers ordered the ice cream and were very impressed. Maybe I will return for a sweet treat but never ever for a meal. My $8 bucks would have gone much further elsewhere. It's crazy to be just as hungry when you've finished eating as when you started. Total waste of funds. For my own experience, 1 star .... The extra one is for the ice cream because everyone seemed to really enjoy it .... Especially our lactose intolerant ladies!"}

It has this kitschy meets hippie vibe. Countr people were nice. I had mock chicken with noodles and you get served in the slanted ceramic bowls they have at mongolian BBQs like Genghis Grill. I had the mock chicken and noodles and if I didnt know better, Id swear it was pretty close to the real thing, the portions were pretty huge I didnt finish mine, but it was pretty cool to check out at least once, though I had kind of wished Id ordered the vegan chili fries when all was said and done."}

All of the soynamis were filled close to the top except for one which was only half full so I asked that they put a little more in it thinking there should be no problem. The gentleman, the owner of the company, told me that he could not fill the rest of the cup because they are weighed out.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "So, it is kind of hard to rate this place. On one hand, my wife and I went here because we are pretty healthy eaters when it comes to our meals - she's practically vegetarian and the only meat I eat on any regular basis is lean chicken, and we both freshly prepare most of our meals with low salt and low fat. So, coming here, you get a very good vegan replication of what are high fat, high salt meals, which people like us don't like. So, was my Calexico burger an excellent replication of a traditional american double burger with cheese down to the very color of the cheese? Yes! Do I actually like traditional american double burgers with cheese? No. Chicken wings, were exceptionally good despite their high salt content, the flavors of the sauce were very much enhanced by the salt, rather than being overwhelmed by it.  If you go here with a full understanding of what you are getting, you will like I it. They have a very varied menu and speedy service. I would definitely go back and try out some other things on the menu that people mentioned in the yelp review, I think the food concept and execution is very, very good and wish we had this amongst our dining options in New Jersey. I wouldn't go here frequently, but I would go here about twice a year, to get something different - which is almost exactly the same as standard fast food, but completely different because its vegan. It's all very confusing :)"}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Green New American is one of the best vegan places I have tried!  The layout of the restaurant is simple with a slight hipster vibe. You seat yourself and can choose between a table or a booth. Even when this place is busy the wait is never too long. Costumers are able to grab an easy to read menu and decide what they want before they reach the cash register which makes the line go by faster. After the cashier takes your order you just find a place to sit until they bring your food out and if you are ordering out they will usually just call your name out but if you are eating in you are given a number to put onto your table. I have never waited more than 15 minutes for my food even on a busy night.  I have been here twice and tried different things each time. The first time I went to Green New American I tried the Chicago Cheesesteak with fries. Since it was my first time eating here I was not sure what to expect. However, when I received my meal in a little brown box I was surprised to see how full the sub was. I took it to go and was so excited to try it. The meal was just a delicious as it looked. You can't even tell that the cheese and meat are vegan. The thyme fries were also just a good. If you gave this to someone who did not know the meal was vegan they would have not been able to tell the difference.  Since I do not live near Green New American the second time I went here I ordered as much as I thought I could eat. I got the big WAC, animal fries, buffalo wings and a chocolate milkshake. I was most excited about the milkshake, it was nice and chocolaty and again you could not tell that there isn't any dairy. The cheeseburger was also delicious! I was shocked how real the 'meat' tasted, the texture and taste were both on point. It was one of the best vegan burgers I have ever tried. Next the animal fries, the cheese and sauce were so good! I just wish there were more in the box because I could not stop eating them. I was bit iffy about the buffalo wings they did not taste bad it just the texture I did not enjoy. However the dill sauce that came with the wings was really good, I was dipping my fries into it. Most vegetarian and vegan restaurants are usually overpriced however all the items here are not!  If I lived closer to Green New American I would probably eat it every day! I would recommend this place to anyone who is vegetarian/vegan and even those who are not. This is a great restaurant to try out if you are in the area. The only thing that would make this restaurant better is if they added one in Scottsdale!"}

I ordered the Singapore orange bowl with mock chicken and noodles...just wonderful! Seasoned well, fresh veggies, and the mock chicken was a very pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to taste and feel fake, but the taste and texture was just like chicken!   My friend ordered the MAC and I swear it tasted exactly like a Big Mac from McDonald's! The thyme fries are delish as well!  To top it off I had a cookie dough Tsoynami...OMG...amazing. Like a blizzard that tasted and had the texture similar to mochi. I loved it.  So clearly the food is not the issue. I will come back despite the problems I'm about to list because the food is so good!  The bad...  I was not happy with the service I received. Not warm or friendly at all. I don't appreciate that smug hipster attitude. Sorry. And they don't serve a hot chai latte??? That was annoying. So I settled for tea and they forgot to give me my hot water and then acted annoyed when I asked for it.  My tea cup was dirty. It had lipstick on it. Hello, we are in the middle of a flu outbreak right now! Not happy about that.   It is expensive. $5 for some ice cream (the tsoynami)? You will not get your money's worth here.  Not many options if you can't have soy. It is in practically everything.  The food gave me horrible gas (sorry tmi). Not the fault of the place but just be aware if you're not used to vegan food. Maybe it was the mock chicken and/or tsoynami because I eat veggies all the time."}

Green should be synonymous with Tasty since all their foods are very good.  I don't care if they are Vegetarian or Vegan, tasty is still tasty, meat or no meat.  Good quality vegetarian foods are not cheap and Green is pretty reasonable with their offering.  They have one of the best mock-meats that I've ever eaten and fresh veggies abound.  I can eat their Vegan Chili Fries by the bucket and still feel good after (tips : add some Sriracha to the ketchup to add more punch to the fries).

We finally found it and went in. Its got a nice atmosphere and the staff were super friendly. It turns out we came on Name your own price day. Well, I'm not sure what they were calling it, but they explained that on this particular day, they were simply asking people to sit and enjoy their meals and whatever they felt like paying for it at the end was what they'd accept (pretty cool!). I tried the sweet and sour mock chicken with noodles (really good!) and my vegetarian friend got the no harm chicken parm (also really good) and our non-vegetarian friend got mock chicken and mushrooms with noodles (I'm not sure if she liked it, but it looked really good, haha). .   When we tried to pay, we hadn't realized the bill had been lumped together, so we each offered to pay our part. The bill would have orginally come to $36 for the three of us (with the two of them each getting a drink, the three of us splitting an appetizer, and myself getting a chocolate soynami). First, one of us tried to pay $18 for their share and the girl looked a bit confused. She accepted the payment and my friend paid next; again she looked like we were underpaying, but by the time I got up there and explained that, This is for my portion of that bill, she seemed to have caught on.   It's a really nice place. I definitely reccomend it. I liked it so much, I talked it up to my boyfriend--a meat eater--and two days later we went back to try it (I'd gotten him interested in it).

Got there not long before closing - no hours posted so we weren't aware.  This was obviously a problem for the staff as they acted like all they cared about was going home.  Why didn't they just tell us that they couldn't prepare the food properly due to the kichen closing soon?  We would have just come back another time.    We ordered the samosa starter - cold in the middle, coconut curry with crispy tofu - was soggy like it came out of a microwave, flatbread pesto pizza - burnt around the edges and cold in the middle.    We were reluctantly given a refund, as the food was inedible (in fact they took the curry away and never bothered to bring anything back).   And to echo a few others on here - lose the styrofoam and plastic cups and cutlery!  How green is your restaurant?  Not very.  Update 11/15/12  Went back here a few weeks ago, this place has really improved.  Best thing was, they're actually using eco-friendly cutlery/cups, etc.  Wahoo!"}

I tried putting siracha and the ranch sauce for the wings on the curry but it was still so plain. I really should've given the dish back. It was hard to eat it was so bland. This 2 star is truly only for the coconut curry. Really, really disappointing."}

So on my girls day out with my mother-in-law yesterday I decided to take her to this restaurant due to great reviews with yelpers.  I got tired of eating the same thing and it's hard to pick restaurants for vegetarian.  First of all the staffs are wonderful and so helpful.  Place was very clean even though it was very busy which is a good sign of great food.  I ordered BBBQ bacon burger with thyme fries and my mother-in-law ordered Singapore Orange with fried noodles.  We shared it all to taste since it's our first time there.  Oh my gosh the sandwich was so yummy with that awesome BBQ sauce.  And fries...best fries other then my mom's of course. Even my mother-in-law who's not a fan of fries couldn't stop eating this fries!  She loved this place so much that she's going to bring her husband here.  I was shocked that they never came here since they lived in Chandler for at least 20 years.  Oh and the Singapore Orange was delicious with mock chicken that I could eat all day.  Only thing was my mother-in-law wished there was more noodles so next time we'll order extra fried noodles on the side for her.  We also had tsoynamics recommended by one of the staffs there.  My mother-in-law likes ice cream but doesn't do well with dairy due to her IBS, so when she heard no dairy is in tsoynamics we ordered one and nice staff split one for us.  It was delicious even for me who is ice cream snob.  I LOVE ice cream and this was delicious with very clean after taste.   Yes I will be coming back to try other fabulous items with my meat loving husband.  He's going to be shocked!!!"}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I've finally visited this place twice now after taste-testing a sample of their food many months ago. I'm not vegan/vegetarian, but this is still a great place to eat. It's a place that I will definitely visit again.  The buffalo wings are a must-have item. The spicy buffalo sauce incorporates fresh garlic and scallions and is better than I've had anywhere else. I get this appetizer every time I go. The Thyme fries are also a nice appetizer. The fries are thinly sliced, nicely spiced, and not greasy.  The dishes are quite large. I have tried the curry and kung pao entrees. Both had nice flavors, but could use more sauce and neither blew me away. The mock meats used in their dishes are very impressive, especially in terms of texture. The appetizers, for me, are large enough to be a meal. Meanwhile, the entree bowls are big enough for two people.   There is a nice collection of house drinks, including lime, lemon, vimto (red fruit drink), and green tea. You can mix and match them as you like and refills are free.  For desert, there is a collection of tsoynamis, which are a soy-based ice cream in DQ Blizzard style. I tried the betterfinger version, which was good, but extremely sweet (like eating cake frosting).   The order line gets backed up to the door, even during off-peak hours. By the way, you order at the counter here, get your own drinks and such, then pick a place to sit. The staff only deliver your food and you clean up after yourself when done. So, this is not a traditional, sit-down restaurant. The environment is very rustic/wooden and laid back. The prices are fair. The staff is very friendly."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "You know what, I like it. It's good, it's fun - the flavors are interesting. My favorite thing is their Soynamis though! Delicious! And so many different ways you can make it. Ambience is okay - the way I see it is I can be surrounded by snooty vegans or snooty carnivores at some fancy schmancy restaurant - either way, the two extremes seem to have the same sort of air about them. So I'm not so crazy about who I'm sharing my meal with, but if the meal is good, I am down with it. Service ain't to shabby - not the best, they seem ocassionally bothered that they have to take your order or that you're not entirely sure what you want, but when you give a person a multitude of ways to make things, you're gonna ask, is this gluten-free, is this dairy-free, etc. You'd think they'd be use to those questions by now. But overall, a definite must-try for the adventurous, and staple to my list of faves."}

I have attended their ThanksLiving event for the last two years and have a great time enjoying delicious fake turkey (made from seiten and breaded), side dishes, and yummy desserts.

Many of my meat-eating friends say that the fake meat is just as delicious with a very similar mouthfeel as the meat they're imitating.  I have ordered salads, stir-fries, and the desserts here and have loved everything.  The stir fry vegetables are cooked to perfection - not too overcooked and crispy but not too raw still. The place can get packed on weekends and evenings, though, so sometimes finding a table can be a problem.  If one chooses an off time, it's usually no problem.   Besides the slowish service, I haven't been superimpressed with the cashiers."}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I'm not a vegetarian. At all. Never have been, truly cannot envision a world in which I ever will be. That being said, I adore Green.  I forgot it existed for a really long time, and fairly recently rediscovered the Scottsdale location. It's not too far from my house, and definitely on my drive home from work... So I foresee this becoming an issue. We went to take out a few dishes on a Friday night, because February-March is the time of year when my life becomes consumed by college basketball, and there was an Arizona game on that night. The line out the door was a little daunting at first, but moved pretty quickly. Pro tip: If you order and pay online, you can mosey on right past all of the peasants in line and just pick your order up at the counter.   Pro tip 2: If you order a tsoynami at the same time as the rest of your food, it gives you pretty much the perfect amount of time to scarf down the tsoynami while you're waiting for your order to come out. Our tsoynami of choice on this trip was the Fluffernutterin. Peanut buttery, banana-y, toasty marshmallowy greatness, combined with the swirlytwirly ice cream of course. It doesn't even taste soy based. It just tastes like heaven.   We decided to share the animal fries. French fries are some of my favorite things in the entire world, and cheese right alongside it, so I was pretty skeptical about vegan cheese ruining one of my favorite dishes. But realistically, I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between vegan cheese and normal American cheese (because let's be honest, it's hardly even real cheese). The fries were excellent, just a tiny bit soggy from the drive home. The onions fried perfectly, and the thousand island flavorful without being too acidic. I was also hesitant about the $5.50 price tag, but you get a TON of fries. Definitely would/will get again.  I'm totally fine to have vegetarian meals here and there, but I'm not a big fake meat person; I have to imagine a big percentage of it is mental, but I feel like fake meat usually makes me feel unwell. So, I opted for the Thai Peanut Bowl, with the house tofu. Best call. Their house tofu is amazing; fried to perfection, it absorbs the sauces but doesn't get soggy and fall apart. The sauce on the bowl was really tasty, just spicier than I was anticipating it'd be (I'm kind of a baby when it comes to spice though). The brown rice was just a little bit overcooked, it seemed a bit dry. The veggies in my bowl seemed to be in kind of a weird limbo state between being raw and cooked... I think I would've preferred them to be left on the pan for just a few minutes longer. Overall, pretty tasty. Just could've used a tiny bit extra love.   Undoubtedly, I will be back. Probably this afternoon to get my tsoynami fix. I'M NOT AN ADDICT, YOU ARE."}

My nephew's chicken nuggets seemed a bit over seasoned but he didn't mind munching on our food.

They serve all different kinds of cuisine there, and they even have appropriate kids meals (macaroni and cheese, chicken nuggets...). There is sure to be something for everyone at green vegetarian!  Cream cheese rangoons would probably be a more suitable name for the crab puffs. They had barely any fake crab meat in them, and were mostly just cream cheese. Would not recommend getting them if you're looking for actual crab puffs.  My cousin got a barbecue chicken sandwich with thyme fries on the side. She let me have some and I found them to be very good. The thyme isn't very noticeable but they were thin, crispy, and lightly salted. Definitely better than just any old fries!  I got the Drunken Mongolian bowl which comes with portobello mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, broccoli, your choice of noodles or brown rice, and your choice of chicken, beef, house tofu, or tofu. I got it with beef and the texture was EXACTLY like that of real beef. The carrots in the bowl were a little undercooked but the sauce it came with was exceptional. For the most part it was a wonderful meal and I would definitely get it again.  I ordered a fruity tsoynami with mixed berries and mangos before I left and I'm actually still eating it as I write this! It has a tiny bit of a chalky aftertaste and they also could have added more fruit considering it was $5 but besides that it's still very good.

I was just trying to find some place with a lot of options on the menu since the group I was with went to another restaurant with limited vegetarian options. As guilty as I temporarily felt about leaving my group, I 100% didn't after taking the first bite of food. It is incredible. I had crab puffs, blonde alfredo, vanilla ts'mores and a couple drinks. The beverages are okay. Nothing major. But the imitation crab puffs are delicious. I loved the vegan version of the blonde alfredo, especially with the chunks of vegan chicken. And as a former Girl Scout who ate entirely too many s'mores as a kid, I thought eating those were long gone as a vegetarian for over 10 years. Not so fast. I loved their ts'mores. I could've had another full cup of that alone. If/when I ever go back to Arizona, there is 100% chance I will revisit here. The prices are super reasonable. The service is casual and friendly. It can get packed in there, but because the weather is usually nice, what makes the crowds easier to withstand are a lot of people go outside and sit at the outdoor tables. Since there is no waiter service, people order from the front and get their foods sent to the table. I loved it. As much as I usually tend to lean towards quieter vegan and vegetarian restaurants, I liked that this one had a Noodles & Company or Chipotle vibe and speed. And again the food was mouth watering."}

When I order take out the portions are always smaller than when you are in the restaurant. I get home thinking I'm going to be able to share with my fiancée only to find that it is a much smaller portion than at Green. Just today I called in for takeout, and for how much the wings and crab puffs cost you barely get anything. Definitely doesn't seem worth it. Vibe buster.  #2. The mystique has sort of worn off and I'm now seeing Green for what it really is: a vegan's junk food spot. Which isn't a bad thing since we all need one of those, but it's sort of disheartening to those that'd like to be a bit more healthy. Not all of their foods are complete junk food but I wouldn't call it healthy.  #3. They're pretty secretive about what's in their food. I went up to the counter to ask where they get their mock chicken from (because it's freakin' delicious and I pretty much hate all other mock chicken I've tried). The guy I asked basically babbled some spiel about how they go through so many distributors and get them from all different places. Knowing full well that he was basically saying he couldn't tell me, I asked anyway if he could tell me a specific brand name and he said no. Any other veg place I've eaten at has been more than happy to divulge this information. Did that suddenly make me stop going because I wanted to make all of the dishes at home myself? Of course not. The whole point of eating out is for the fun of it. That really bummed me out.  Green, I hate to say it, but you've kind of disappointed this vegan.

They make great tasting, fun vegan food that would be perfect for someone who is having a hard time transitioning off of meat.

Non-healthy tips - get the Ranchero salad with wing sauce instead of BBQ sauce and you might want extra ranch. No harm parm, blackjack pita, and big wac are my husband's favorites. I could eat the green salad with ranch every day.   The staff seem to like their jobs and they get our take-out orders right almost EVERY time, which is amazing considering that we eat here at least a couple of times a week. The great thing, though, is that with an all vegan restaurant we never have to worry about them accidentally giving us parts of dead animals.  We also recommend the tsoynamis (vegan blizzards) if you want a major sugar rush. Unfortunately, they don't have all of the same baked goods as the Phoenix location, but occasionally they'll have cookies and those are good.

I told the girl taking our orders that I am not a vegan, thinking I may be shunned from the establishment, but instead she told me she wasn't either and then she assured me that their faux meat actually tastes like sweet, juicy, animal meat (my words, not hers). Praise Jesus! And she was so right! I had the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and it actually tasted like chicken! However, it didn't feel any healthier to eat. Loaded with BBQ sauce and mayo, I still felt like a fatty. My husband, also the polar opposite of anything vegetarian, ordered the Diablo Red and fell in love. This place is nearing a 4 star review, but the menu looks so scary to me that I don't know if I can give it a 4 yet. Lots of spicy items and I don't like spice.

My husband and I were only able to tell which bowl was which by the mock chicken in mine. There was absolutely no difference in the flavor between the 2 bowls. I told the waitress that there was no flavor in either, and she just shrugged and said it depends on who's cooking on how it tastes. I told her that mine had NO  flavor, that if I closed my eyes and had a spoonful, I couldn't tell if I was eating a piece of broccoli or the mock chicken, and there was not even a hint of coconut or curry. She just said sorry about that and walked off. For $10 a bowl, it was definitely a disappointing meal."}

I'm not a fan of processed soy based food, which made it difficult to explore the menu like I really wanted to. The wait for my salad was even longer, there were no clean tables and it was clear that they were understaffed.   Finally my food arrives, and after taking the first... I was genuinely impressed.

Everything I've ever had here has been good. I loved it when I was a vegetarian and I love it now that I'm not. It was definitely hard to convince some meat eaters to come to a vegan place but once I got them there they all loved it. I don't know how this chef does it but all of the mock meat tastes so real its crazy. I think the Calexico burger is my favorite thing that I've tried thus far but the menu is pretty big so I still have a lot of ground to cover. The bowls and the po boys are the bomb too and so are the crab puffs. I've only tried one of the soynamis (I think it was a PB&J one) but it was soooo good. I always go with the intention of getting one but then I'm too full after eating my main meal that I just can't do it, rough life. I'll have to go back one of these 115 degree days and go solely for that reason. Also, I've seen some vegan jerky in there that I've wanted to try before. And they usually have a really good special of the day. One thing to note is don't expect that it's going to be some super crazy healthy vegan place. I would classify this more as vegan comfort food.

As for the food...for starters, I've had the spring rolls which are greasy but ok, the crab puffs which are ADDICTIVE, the fake hot wings which are so similar to the real thing its a little scary. The hummus is intense, but good; however I wish the accompanying pita weren't fried. Green likes to fry.   The bowls are alright (would not recommend for takeout because they'll taste like the cardboard box) because the veggies are cooked well and the sauce flavor is good, I like the Mongolian, but I've had better tofu. The Singapore on the back of the menu is delicious.   The BEST thing on the menu is the Green Burger although I don't care much for the fries.

The ciabatta was crisp, the lettuce was fresh, the soy based chicken was a perfect dupe, and the buffalo flavor was akin to the deliciousness of Franks and Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo wing sauces.

The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.  12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw.

And I think Green may be an answer to my survival of the summer here in AZ.  My friend and I wanted to get a bike ride on a beautiful night but didn't want to just get a beer and we kind of wanted to go around the Tempe lake, ruling out southern Tempe options. Green. Green is open on Mondays! (BUT NOT SUNDAYS) And til 9! Its 7:15-lets get our asses movin'!  Smack inbetween major traffic lights (thus hard to cross), we found a full parking lot and an empty bike rack...sweeeet. Just about every table was full with a pretty diverse crowd-mostly hip, but everyone was real casual and didn't have their Scottsdale poker face on. I was confused when we first walked in-do we get seated? I stared and smiled at one woman who I thought was a waitress-but then she sat down. Whoops. A tad awkward, no? Went to the counter and greeted with beautiful lil menus-they have a LOT of stuff. AND I CAN EAT ALL OF IT.  I am a lactose-intolerant vegetarian. But not vegan. But a vegan diet is the healthiest one for me, obvi. My mind was blown away. Even at vegetarian places I still have half the menu eliminated due to dairy. Only at the Angelika Kitchen in NYC Village am I this over-whelmed. And while Green may not be as healthy-who really cares when its THIS GOOD? I was so overwhelmed I just went for the Argentian sandwich-fake beef strips with hot sauce and fake cheese added WITH a choice of sides for 6.50? That is VALUE. I opted for the fountain soda (their unsweetened iced tea is a good deal), but I saw they have Virgils' Root Beer, the best root beer on earth after Stewarts-and will totally get that next time.   We sat down in the somewhat dimly lit room-it is kind of industrial feeling, but not hippy at all-but not overly chic at all. Reminds me of a cross b/w Orange Table and Lux in terms of ambiance with the casualness and hottie factor of Pita Jungle. There were multi-coloured car doors lined up on the far wall of the restaurant and the noise level was cordial. We got our Crab Cream Puffs first-ooooooommmmyyyygoooood. For like 3 something, I was in a very special place. I didnt even know you could do that with tofutti cream cheese! Amazing with a sweet tangy sauce. Our food came pretty quickly and I got to have my thyme fries with a side of Vegannaise. My sandwich was HUGE and for no other ways to describe it as BANGIN. I miss Philly Cheese Steaks-and this is my happy replacement!   The owner ended up talking to us and I asked about the soy ice cream-they were out of cones which made me inexplicibly sad. He said they do Soy-namis, which are their version of Dairy Queen's Blizzards where they made a thick shake with goodies added in. I walked back up to the counter and had trouble figuring out what I could possibly add to my stomach so I didn't keel over in a food coma off my bike on the way home. I went for the super sweet and did like a sundae in a cup with newmans chocolate oreo things and chocolate sauce with cherries. It was amazing. It was like 3.50 and it was too much for us 2 to share...but that doesn't mean we didn't finish it.  I can't believe it took me this long to come here-the atmosphere, options and the cheapness of the food shocked me. I mean, people had told me it was good, I just didn't expect it to be THIS good.

The service here is great and you can get in and out pretty quickly. Highly recommend!"}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "For some odd reason I got a wild hair up my butt and wanted to try a vegetarian restaurant.  I still have no idea why.  My wife and I are not vegans or anything close to it, but I still wanted to try something new and exciting.  I wanted something close to home and Green was rated the best in my area so I figured what the heck.  The place looked exactly like what I expected.  I am totally preppy so my only words to describe it is hippy.  The place was pretty packed with weird hippy people but everyone was very nice.  It wasn't really my scene but it didn't matter because I was there for the food and a new experience.  When my wife and I first entered the establishment we first waited for a hostess to seat us for a few seconds.  Then, after figuring out that it was probably a seat yourself type of place, we took a seat and waited for a waitress/waiter.  Most of the other tables had people looking over menus so we figured that a waitress/waiter took orders.  After a few minutes of sitting, we decided that we should probably go up to the counter and order.  Not that I had a problem with it, its just that it was very confusing.  Anyway, here is the rundown of what we ordered and my rating of it.   * spicy buffalo wings - they didn't look like it, but they did have the texture and flavor of real wings....kinda.  The sauce was good and spicy but was very very salty.  The ranch was good too.  I would order this again.  * artichoke gratine - very good and pretty spicy - I would order again  * green burger - neither myself or my wife was a fan of this.  * diablo red bowl - I actually thought this was good.  Aside from it being very very very very salty, the dish was very flavorful and had a nice kick to it.  I ordered it with mock beef which somehow had the texture and flavor of beef.  All in all I thought this place was ok.  The staff is friendly, the food was ready quickly and the prices are reasonable.  My only real issue is with the food.  Since I don't have any issues eating meat, I would just assume go to a place that serves real meat.  This place goes through a lot of trouble to make food that tastes/looks/feels/smells like meat for a bunch of people that don't want to eat meat.  It is all very strange to me.  Although I probably won't be back unless I develop a severe allergy to meat and dairy, I would recommend it to people who want to try something different.  You probably won't find a better place to try out the vegan lifestyle and truly appreciate your carnivorous ways."}

I had the green burger which I thought was just ok, I've had much better veggie burgers before. My date (a vegetarian) had the pizza, which she didn't like at all, I think the mock cheese had something to do with it.   The location is in a strip mall, which wasn't that great, and the ambiance in the restaurant seemed very eclectic (not in a good way).    All and all I'd say I much prefer other semi-vegetarian restaurants, such as Pita Jungle, over this place."}

I'm not a vegan, not even a vegetarian, but I welcome new tastes with loving arms (er..mouth)...Anyways, I've been here a couple times now, and the mock food was pretty good!  The 1st visit, I tried the Lemon Pesto bowl with mock chicken, it was pretty good overall, but I wasn't really a fan of the weird, chewy mock chicken.  Luckily, there were only 3! pieces in it, so I was okay with that I guess.   The second time around, I tried the Coconut Curry bowl with the house tofu.  It was delicious!!  The house tofu is lightly fried and seasoned, so good I think most people would like it,  even if they weren't into health food.   Since I'm an ice cream lover, I had to try the Tsoynami, homemade vegan soy tSoft tServe,  which then they stir in all sorts of goodies like cakes, cookies, chocolate, peanut butter and just about anything you can think of.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "3/17/10  I know it's been awhile since I was last here, although not quite as long as sixteen months!  I see that the decor has changed yet again-- last time major add I knew of was the painted poetry on the wall next to the restroom.  There are now car door cutouts-as-art lining two walls near the front of the resto, along w/ a couch, or two.  Eclectic, and a nice add to the vibe that Green already exudes.    Tried the crab puffs again (it's been awhile since I last had them).  Wished I didn't.  Don't know if it's the ingredients in the vegan cream cheese (it contains corn/derivatives), or the fact that they're deep-fried (not all fried items make me queasy after), or both, but I'm not going to order these again.  I should've just thrown them away, but the crunchiness of the wonton (have I mentioned that I love crunchy-munchy foods?) and the cost of this app, $4 (or $1 a pop), made me plow on.  Never again.  The original g spicy po-boy made me forget my disappointment, however, as I crunched through the scrumptious mock chicken and its lovely and indeed spicy buffalo sauce!  Three battered buffalo mock chicken patties nestled between tomato slices, arugula, and Green's amazing vegan mayo on a toasted vegan hoagie roll, along w/ a side of thyme fries... Mmm... a must-try!  Seeing others enjoying their tsoynami sundaes made me want to get one myself, so after some deliberation, I decided on one of the daily specials- Death by Chocolate: vanilla soy ice cream w/ vegan brownie chunks, Newman's Own chocolate wafer crumbles, and vegan chocolate syrup.  Undeniably choco-licious, but something was amiss... I believe I was wishing for a colder sensation that regular ice cream offers and that soy ice cream cannot deliver.  It wasn't a warm day, and the tsoynami sundae that was delivered to me already had that sheen that regular ice cream develops when it's allowed to sit around and melt.  Don't get me wrong- it's the combination of cold/ solid and slightly melted and slippery that makes a frozen dessert a success for me, but tsoynamis generally make me wish I'd saved the calories and visit a gelateria, instead.  Which, as a non-vegan, I will.  Next time.    While the app and dessert left me wishing I didn't indulge, the g spicy po-boy indubitably made my tastebuds sing.  I'll just have to stick w/ the artichoke gratine and say sayonara to tsoynami in the future.  Don't the photos look divine, though?"}

They don't come with the burger anymore which is a bummer, but I'm also probably a few pounds lighter as a result so maybe it's for the best.   They have awesome specials and check out their tsoynamis as well. The one with captain crunch is amazing as is the raspberry one. Or the windmill, or... you get it, they're all pretty amazing.

After we ate, my sister said she thought she could kill a vampire with her breath because it was so garlicky.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "So just in case this is the first review you've read about this place, let me be the one to tell you - it's vegan. Not vegetarian (no meat, but eggs and dairy), but vegan. And several of their dishes are mock - made to resemble normal meat dishes (hot dogs, burgers, chicken, etc.). I know that right there either turns people on or off. Me, I dig it. My freezer's stocked with Boca, Morning Star, Quorn and Gardenburger products. That said, not all of their mock products work. While I love heir Spicy Buffalo Wings, Crab Puffs, Vegan Chili Fries and Mum's Meatball Po-boy, I was disappointed with the No Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich and the Vegan Hot Dogs. Haven't built up the courage to try their pizzas just yet - my previous experience with vegan cheese hasn't been all that great. But I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually, I stop by for lunch with my meat-eating friends at least once a month. But don't worry, mock isn't all they have to offer. They've also got tofu - a Spicy Peanut Tofu appetizer as well as a good variety of noodle and rice bowls.  And it's a pretty cool place - I really dig the decor, from the Volkswagen doors along an entire wall to the local art work."}

If you are one of my anonymous followers on Yelp, you know I love meat.  When we make plans to eat at Green, I get excited because the food is great despite the fact that there is no meat.  They just make great food at Green.  I usually get one of fruit-flavored sodas that come in the glass bottles from the refrigerators next to where your order your food.  Never had one that tasted good, but it is fun trying them all.  Maybe one day I'll start worrying about my sugar intake.  And the tSoynami's are really good, but closer to a dessert than a drink.  The wings were suggested to me on my first visit, which seemed a bit daring for a vegan restaurant, but . . . they were great and I get them all the time.  I would not recommend a vegan pizza unless you know what you are getting yourself into.  My mostly vegetarian daughter lives off of cheese and mushroom pizza, but couldn't stomach the vegan verity.  Now she has the crab puffs and peanut tofu appetizers.  And my vegetarian wife gets whatever she wants and doesn't have to ask about unmentioned ingredients, which I have been told is a rare and liberating experience.  The layout of the interior provides a friendly and inviting atmosphere.  We usually try to snag the couches.  Art from aspiring artist usually decorate the walls, and the bathrooms offer really cool sinks.  Opposite the wall of art is a mural made up of re-used and re-claimed materials.  I like it and my daughter always has a few questions about it (e.g., Are those car doors real?  What is that?), which gives me a chance to point out that re-using is even better than recycling, although both have merit.  A few more visits to Green, and I'm sure my daughter will know what I'm talking about.  And our Tempe location, the original location, is better than your Phoenix location.  There, I said it.

I spoke with the young lady (her name escapes me now) at the counter who was very friendly and knowledgeable. I told her truthfully that I was not a vegetarian and did she have any suggestions. At her direction, I tried the crab puffs and the Thai peanut bowl with mock chicken. I walked it back to my hotel.  All I can say is.....WOW! The mock chicken tasted like..... well,..... CHICKEN! Great chicken actually. I don't really go for straight tofu and the vegetarian god who prepared this must have known it. I did not miss the chicken. The Thai peanut bowl was quite spicy and delicious. The crab puffs were very good, a little greasy, and not as good as the real thing, but well worth it, and if I am here again I will probably have them again. Way to go!

I can't believe I brought my family including one vegan visiting from LA to Green.  There was no skill or sense in the balance of flavors in any of the dishes.  Obviously whoever made the food does not eat it themselves.  All the dishes were overwhemingly drenched in sauce assaulting the taste buds with either saltiness or sourness.    The wings were incredibly sour and then when you dip them into the ranch sauce it becomes unbearably salty as well.  Thank goodness for the celery sticks.    The salad contained hardly any figs which we really had to dig for to find two small pieces.  And the balsamic was really sour.  In smaller amounts it would probably have tasted fine.  The apricot miso bowl was really sour again.  And for a vegetarian restaurant, it would've been nice to see more vegetables.  We wish all the sauces came on the side so that we could actually have tasted the other components of the dishes.   The Texas portabello po-boy was also over-sauced.  The only redeeming part of it was the tahini coleslaw.  That was nice and crunchy and properly seasoned.  It seems to me that the chef needs to check in on the kitchen or taste his food more often."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "in brief: Yum yum in my tum tum! their vegan dishes are enjoyable even for the carnivorsaurs. However, if you're not vegan, pass on the soy-based ice creams  I ordered:   1. Mac and Cheese with Veggie ($7.50):  Delish! It was warm cheesy and gooey and just all the positive adjectives you would want to associate with a mac and cheese. I could tell from taste that it wasn't normal cheese, but it was still delicious none the less! It's a cheddar based cheese sauce with elbow macaroni, with broccoli, zucchini and carrots. The taste was spot-on as a vegan mac and cheese, although the macaroni were a little softer than I'd like; definitely not al dente. I'm thinking its because vegan pasta noodles cooks differently than regular pasta noodles, so it's not fair for me to complain :)   2. Banana Cream Pie-- one of their Soy, vegan ice creams.  (~$5 for 16 oz) This flavor i had ordered was their special, it was banana cream pie. It was good enough to cool you down on a hot day, but it was meh tasting. The base tastes like soy milk with thickener, and it was mixed with added banana slices and then topped with a blahhh tasting whip-toping. :(  Although it wasn't too sweet, and I appreciated that; but I'd much rather have a pint of hagen daaz of coffee ice-cream for half the price at a supermarket than to get this.  I would definitely come back to try their other items! I had a piece of their mock chicken and mock-bbq meat, both as were delicious in salads!  Recommendation: try one of their bowls! There are many exciting ones to try on the menu!"}

The fries are also excellent, and I'm not even a huge french fry eater.  I want to like the crab puffs, but I'm not vegan, and I still love my real cream cheese.  Oh well.

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "This is the kind of place that could turn a carnivore into a vegetarian.  I have always been very resistant to soy products and any form of faux meat.  It just always seemed so gross to me.  Due to a recent change in my lifestyle to be healthier, I have looked into healthier alternatives including what I used to turn my nose up at.  We saw a demonstration at Devoured by Chef Damon where he turned some of the weirdest ingredients (to me) into a beautiful yummy dish.  I had to see what else he had to offer.  First of all, the place is nothing like I expected.  I'm not sure why, but I was expecting something along the lines of True Food Kitchen.  Instead, it felt like a mess hall at some weird Liberal Arts school, and I say all that in a good way.  It's an order and pay at the counter then wait for your food at a table ordeal, which normally is fine by me.  Unfortunately the girl who had our food never bothered to call out the name we gave and instead walked around casually asking people who she thought might have ordered our dishes if it was theirs.  Finally she made her way to us after about five minutes.  That was annoying.  Forget about that though, because the food is good enough to make up for that little mishap.  (Other staff members seemed to call out names perfectly fine, just not that one.)  I ordered the Drunken Mushroom Chicken and grabbed an Oogave soda out of the cooler for my dinner.  The soda was great, and you can buy them at Sprouts, awesome.  The Chicken was expertly crafted with a texture almost identical to chicken and a taste just as close.  The breading around it was yummy, slightly crunchy, and a tiny bit sweet.  My bowl was packed full of delicious fresh veggies and loads of mushrooms.  There was also a generous helping of rice noodles buried in there too.  It was all fantastic, and I would eat it every night if I could.  i will most certainly be back to Green to try everything else on their menu.  Everything looks so good!  When it's actually good for you too, you just can't resist!"}

Their fries were far superior to many traditional burger joints'. But... they're still FRENCH FRIES, people. The jerk tofu salad was impressively spicy, but laden in too-many FRIED won ton strips and chunks of FRIED tofu. Do you see the theme? No wonder my SO nodded enthusiastically throughout the whole meal and offered to come back any time.   I had the G po-boy, buffalo chicken on a big spongy roll, dripping and oozing in spicy sauce and vegan mayo. The fake meat they use is really, really, really authentic. Like, so authentic, I'm not going to get it next time because I really don't like meat in the first place, hence my vegetarianism. Stringy fibers in my fake chicken grosses me out as much as the stringy fibers in real chicken. The sandwich was tasty -- the bread surprisingly excellent -- but greasy.   So yeah.

Proprietor Damon Brasch, who I had a secret crush on (up until he grew a beard!).  Accidentally bumped into him and his wife having dinner somewhere.  Sweet couple.   17. For sale art displays by local artists adorn the walls.  Pretty cool.    The only thing I would complain about is the long wait.  It's been a few months since I last visited, so I don't know if the ordering process is still the same: order at the counter, receive food at the table.  If you spy any of those awesome peanut butter chocolate bars at the counter as you're ordering, make sure you grab one (or three!) as they will most-assuredly run out before you find your way back at the front of the line.  I just shuddered blissfully at the thought of biting into one of these... But I digress.  The wait for the food is worth it, however.  Just be sure to order any of the items I mentioned above, and you'll do fine.  (Do your tastebuds a HUGE favor and avoid the pasta items.  I've tried the orecciete pasta, singapore tofu, and the curry pasta salad.  I detested all of them.)  Looks like Brasch added a couple of new items to the menu- ranchero salad and secret bbq chicken sandwich.  I'm going to have to get myself over there very soon to try some bbq!  Note: the mock chicken used in the wings is not the same used in all of the other dishes.  A good thing, bec. the wings we ordered were VERY stringy.  This happens when soy is frozen sometimes, I was told.  The Argentine sandwich tastes just like a Philly steak sandwich!  I ordered mine sans vegan cheese ($2 add), but I soon regretted that decision.  I believe Green uses Follow Your Heart vegan cheese (melts very well!), so the addition should complete the deception.    Do yourself a favor and stop at Green for a bite soon.  Oh, and Green runs Friday and Saturday night specials from time to time.  I once had a green sobi noodle entree (wheat sobi noodles with a pesto sauce to die for!).  I haven't chanced upon any specials after that (this was around Valentine's Day '07).  I've given up on their specials, but I'm always assured that they still hold them everytime I ask via phone.    They allow call ahead orders for dining in so that the food is ready to be devoured upon arrival.  Just be sure to time it well so that food is fresh."}

The menu seems like there are a lot of options but what they do really well are their bowls and their sandwiches. We had their Diablo Red bowl - a spicy veggie and rice creation we got with 'chicken,' and the pasta with 'meatballs.' We also split the 'wings.' They totally have their mock meats down. I was most surprised by the meatballs which were tender and flavorful with a near perfect texture. Their bowl sizing is perfect, I could eat more but that's probably about as much as I should have.   The next time we had the 'green burger,' a house-made veggie burger with oats that's actually red in color. It inspired me to start Googling around for how to make something similar because it was such a fresh take on a veggie burger. He had another bowl- the curry with 'chicken' which was fantastic.   This is the best overall vegan place I've tried in a long while, it nails the balance between creative and attainable where all feel welcome.    I hope they eventually slide into a more cozy atmosphere. It's not awful, but I can't see its dinner business growing in its current location."}

We stood in line to order while perusing the menu. While vegetarian food is hardly new, finding a place that was totally packed and had such varied items on the menu was an new experience.  We all started out with the eggless rolls ($4.00). Crisp, beautifully made spring rolls with cabbage, carrots, noodles, and spices, served with a lovely dipping sauce. This was so good that it set the stage for high expectations for the main course, and we were not disappointed.   Most of us ordered the Big-Wac ($9.00), a perfect take off on the Big Mac*. It was offered with your choice of frys, fruit, or cole slaw. Even with your eyes open you believe this was made at the golden arches. The faux meat looked and had the texture of real meat patties. It even had special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and a sesame seed bun. It was also just as filling as the variety with meat. This came in a basket filled to overflowing with pencil thin French fries with what had to be homemade ketchup. The only word that comes to mind is delicious.  One of our companions ordered the kung pao bowl ($8.50). While he said he could taste the difference between the faux meat and the real thing, he none the less said it was very tasty and enjoyed it.  A number of us ordered dessert. A large cup filled from the bottom first with cookies, then homemade banana ice cream, and topped with whipped cream. I could not finish either my burger or my dessert.  Beverages are all non-alcoholic, with assorted teas being the only option for those who cannot have sugar.  The premises were clean, and tables were bussed almost as soon as they were emptied. Service was prompt and courteous.  3 stars for quality of food, service, and cleanliness."}

Time and time again, I wonder why a culinary mecca like SF doesn't have a vegan restaurant as affordable and good as these other places I visit.  I've come to learn that some of the best food comes from these strip mall, hole-in-the-walls.  Green is just the latest.    Their Green burger is beet red, similar to that of the one served at The Plant Cafe in the City, but as a thinner patty.  I love that they actually offer fries, and not some measly greens as a side.  But it's so good, in fact, that I've gone to TPC twice in the past week just to reminisce.  I've also tried the argentine po-boy, with steak seitan strips, caramelized peppers and onions, vegan mayo, and a spicy sauce.  Though, the sandwich wasn't spicy in the least, it was still rather tasty, and just as messy as a po-boy should be.    I try to stick with American fare at vegan restaurants, since they tend to excel at those than ethnic dishes, if they should serve them.  But my friend really enjoyed her stir fry noodle bowl.  The portions are large, and everything seems to be packed with flavor.  The Tsoynamis have to be the absolute best item on the menu, their own vegan soft-serve concoction of various flavors.  It's technically a dessert, but I treated it as a thick, creamy shake to go along with my meal--even if I had to use a spoon to consume it.     I can't wait to come back next year."}

The decor is interesting, lots of different artists have their work displayed on the walls and it changes around every month. Green can get very busy, especially during the dinner hours, and you might have to wait for 15-20 minutes in line. The cashiers are friendly and your food is usually brought out surprisingly fast.   Decor and service aside, the food is amazing! Buns can sometimes get soggy(secret bbq sammie) and some things are very salty(the chili), but at the end of the day it's delicious and comforting food. Their Big Wac is better than Mcdonald's, and I wouldn't want mock chicken from anywhere else. Seriously, the mock chicken is like a tender crunchy giant chicken tender. Their fries are thin cut and crispy and I love pairing it with the BFF, a spicy and savory chicken sandwich. They are generous with the portions here, and I often over eat because the food is so delicious. Any of their sandwiches are a safe bet to order and what I would recommend the most. The animal fries are tasty, but I think there should be more toppings for how many fries come with it. The wings are good, as are the samosas, but for the price of both I think there are better valued things on the menu. Good vegan crab puffs are hard to find, but Green definitely delivers delicious crab puffs. Thee fighting artichoke and peanut chicken are yummy salad options, and I would also recommend the Thai peanut rice bowl. You might think after all that food I'd be stuffed, but every time I MUST order a Tsoynami. It is the end all be all for vegan ice cream. The vegan answer to a blizzard is definitely satisfying: a creamy sweet ice cream swirled with whatever toppings you choose, from vegan butterfingers (Betterfinger) to delicious granola and peaches (Lifes a peach). I highly recommend their ice cream tsoynamis. Between those and the Big Wac, anyone would be sure to leave satisfied.

If you have room, definitely get dessert! Their donuts, cookies, and etc are the bomb! Easily waaaayyyy better than their traditional counterparts.

Try:  orecciette pasta"}

I've eaten at SO many vegetarian/vegan places all around the world and this is by far one of the BEST. The prices and service are awesome as well.    Food recommendations are:  classic pizza with just about any topping, pesto pizza is good but too rich for my tastes.  The wings, crab puffs, and chili fries are out of this world good.  Original G spicy po-boy [think buffalo chicken sandwich] and the argentine [think philly cheesesteak] are pretty much unmatched.  Order off menu the BBQ chicken sandwich!  Its AMAZING.   Jerk tofu salad ooooh how I miss you. And they make their own organic vegan soft serve?  AND they make them into tsoynamis [think DQ blizzard]?!  Yeah.  This place owns.  Basically, if you are lucky enough to be vegetarian in phx [hah] at least you have one great thing on every other vegetarian in more veg friendly cities.   Even my non-veg family and friends want to eat here over just about anywhere else in the valley as well.  Take that applebeees!"}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "Green....how I love thee.  Green may be vegan/vegetarian, but I certainly wouldn't claim it to be 'health' food.  Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it, however the food here is no less than amazing!    The decor is unique and fresh; 10-12 tables, a couch/lounge area, random artwork on the walls, painted quotes, lights hanging from the ceiling, and old painted car doors along one wall.  I've tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me...but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings.  I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based, Quorn perhaps (may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome).  I am not personally vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked.  I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers (if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing).  Great prices, great dishes, unique/fun atmosphere, and great service!!!   (On one Saturday evening around 6:30 my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go, the place had a line out the door and it took about 30-45 min to get our food.  We weren't even upset about the wait, just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized.  THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE!)  Love this place so much!"}

I love crab puffs and was so happy to have a vegan version that didn't taste gross. I couldn't even tell it was vegan cream cheese (I'm sure we all know it's usually hit-or-miss) or fake crab! Also, I had the orecciette pasta with the no harm chicken parm, and loved it. The only problem with that was that even though they used Daiya vegan cheese, which I love, is that they just lumped it on the top and it was impossible to spread around, so that kind of ruined the parm part.   Also, their vegan chocolate chip cookies are incredible and I couldn't believe they were vegan so I even asked again just to make sure! (Yes, they're vegan).   I will definitely be coming here again.

Artichoke Dip was watery and looked like light grey/brown colored gunk.  I got the Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl with tofu and was only able to take a couple bites because it really tasted awful. I typically really like eating tofu too. Please believe me in that I am not a picky eater and it is very rare for me to dislike a restaurant meal.  My boyfriend got a mock beef dish that had this underlying soy flavor.

It will not fill that I am craving Asian food void you might be feeling. It won't even fill that I would like something with flavor void. Harsh, but true.

He is a meat lover whereas I am a vegetarian so of course we can't agree on a place to eat, plus he is allergic to snooty organic places where an ok dish costs like a million dollars and everyone pretends to like it because it is the place to be.  After reading reviews on Yelp and looking at the menu, we decided to give Green a try. I was crossing my fingers because anyway vegetarians don't have much of a choice when eating out. We ordered wings, a BBQ chicken burger and a Mexicali burger. The first wing the husband ate made him a convert; I was already in love with the food and the options and the price. The burgers were great and the fries were DELICIOUS!  We've decided to make this place one we'll frequent. Love the ambience, the quick service and everything about it. Thank goodness for Green!"}

My dining experience here was the best I had on the trip and I know if I lived in the area I'd be eating here at least once a week.   One of the things that impressed me so much was that Green makes all of their vegan mock meat and cheese goodies from scratch. The No-Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich stole the show, and was not made with your standard morningstar chik patty but rather a seitan-based lightly breaded from scratch recipe. The fake mozzarella cheese (which seemed more like ricotta) was creamy and delicious.   The vegan chili on the fries was tangy with just a little spice, and my boyfriend's Argenitine po-boy was a good take on fake steak.  The sides of tahini coleslaw and curry pasta salad were quite tasty as well. I only wish I'd had room to enjoy an oatmeal pie or a Tsoynami for dessert.   The service at Green was very friendly and it has a nice but casual artsy decor. I can't wait until my next trip to Phoenix!"}

Before, the vegan meat was INCLUDED in the salad -- now I have to pay upwards of 30% more to add it. Moreover, the salads are noticeably smaller with less fresh greens. I've also noticed a stark difference in quality in the Tempe location (much worse quality of ingredients and much smaller portions) compared to the downtown location.

The Chicago Cheesestake, BFF, Secret BBQ Sammie, Classic Burger are all great sandwiches which feature top quality meat alternatives. I tried each sandwich and they were all great. However, their top sandwich in my opinion is their Big Wac which if you've been living under a rock is mock up of a Big Mac.

This made me a little less nervous.  Carnivores, take it from me: no need to worry. This place ROCKS. The buffalo wings are plenty spicy - I liked them better than any actual chicken wings I've ever had. The samosas were wonderful: a nice flaky crust, and the filling was very savory with an excellent texture. I had the Mongolian bowl with not-beef, which was delicious: good noodles, fresh vegetables, and the only way I knew the not-beef wasn't beef was the texture. The portions were great and the staff was friendly.  For dessert, I got an oatmeal pie: two oatmeal cookies with a creme filling between. DELICIOUS!

My kids & I are vegetarian while my husband is vegan and this place satisfys us all. This place is a quality vegetarian place & they like to be eco-friendly & green... added bonus as far as I am concerned. Can't wait to fly back to the Phoenix area to stop in this awesome gem of a place!"}

Not only incredible but I'm convinced the mock chicken is not mock at all but rather real chicken! Coming from someone who loves their meat that's saying a lot! The texture is like actual chicken. If someone brought me this mock chicken and told me it was chicken I would completely believe them because it tastes so real. The first time I made the mistake of ordering the crispy tofu. Oh it was a long line but *make sure to get a menu to look at while waiting in line*. It took me longer than the long line took to decide what to get. Make it easy on yourself and order mock chicken! Also make sure you get the correct menu (grain free or not). Don't bother with the tofu or anything other than the mock chicken! I had the mock chicken in the buffalo chicken wings. Mmm mmm mm! I wish I ordered that as my main dish. I said it was better than any real chicken I had at a restaurant (I may have to go back again and try it to re-confirm this outlandish idea). On top of that I got a cup for a drink. Not only do they have the regular soda machine but they have 3 of their homemade drinks. I had their cherry soda with their green tea. Mmm mm good! The cherry soda is like nothing I've tasted. Mmm good! I got the soynami on top of that. That was actually the only disappointing thing about this restaurant. I got the ginger snap soynami but it had vanilla cookie pieces and tasted nothing like ginger snaps. The second time I went there I had the mint oreo soynami very good!

There have been some recent changes and I have to say I am so happy with them. Before, you were able to get a side, like fries or cole slaw with a burger. This is fine, but sometimes we didnt want those sides. Sides are now ala carte and I love this option! Before we would only get wings, our two sandwiches with the fries. NOW we are able to get wings, another side, and our sadnwiches. I like that there are more options now. I am also incredibly happy with the new patty change. I always liked wendy's pickle but I opted for otherwise because of the chicken tender type patty. The new one is way better, easier to eat, and all around tasty.

Unfortunately, I have to say, you're all wrong.  It's really baffling to me how so many people apparently like this place. It's amazing that they actually managed to make vegan burgers taste *worse* than McDonald's. Their bowls? The texture is all off. The flavors were not balanced. I've tried four different entrees here, and all were terrible. The fries were also mediocre.  It's like it's vegan food for people who don't actually want to be healthy.  What's really interesting about this Yelp rating is I decided to ask a few friends if they have eaten here, just to scope out what the general non-Yelper population thinks. I asked one of my fellow carnivore friends, and his opinion was It's shit. Just this past weekend I asked a mostly-vegan friend what she thinks of Green. Shit. Nobody minced words. All the real people I know seem to agree: it's shit.  I personally like the idea of reducing meat intake; it seems like the moral *and sustainable* thing to do. Believe me, I'm not some anti-vegan, Ronald Reagan-worshiping Republican; I can't stop eating at the delicious, all-Vegan Desert Roots Kitchen. I'll even order black bean burgers at normal restaurants (which are almost always an order of magnitude better than those flimsy, feeble patties they have here). This is just bad food. The only thing worth eating is the tSoynamis.  If you think about it, by serving up this terrible, overpriced vegan food, they're encouraging me to go eat more meat. How immoral."}

The dry sodas they sell and their homemade lemon and limeades are amazing. One of my favorite reasons to come there.

We all ended up ordering burgers with fries.  I loved the fries because they were super skinny fries and came out hot, but I did not care for my burger which I felt was bland.  The kids did not care for how skinny the fries were but liked their burgers and my daughter said their food was good for being Vegan and she would go back.  My son and I both agreed we would not want to go back.  I will say that the long line never ended, so perhaps it's just not a great place for folks who like actual meat products.      The staff was super friendly and service was relatively quick as well, but the panic sets in when you think your food is coming and you still don't have a table.

Classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl, the singapore tofu bowl (although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on), the vegan BBQ chicken sammich (I just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor), and then there are the eternally awesome specials.  Even though you'll probably be stuffed post-meal... make room for dessert. It's mind over matter anyway. Order a Tsoynami - they're like McFlurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins.

On another note, this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the Tempe/Scottsdale area with a lively, hip atmosphere.

Had you never heard anything about this place before, from the view outside Green you would most likely drive right on by. Its also kind of hidden but that hasn't slowed down their business one little bit and here is why. THE FOOD IS KILLER. Seriously.  The staff was super friendly, they serve and offer vegetarian food as well as all natural beverages, organic, vegetarian and vegan shelf foods to take home. While there I had a kombucha tea to drink, my boyfriend had an all natural cola and we shared the chili fries and the apricot miso bowl with fresh tofu. The portions were great and we were super full after. We spent around $21 after both food items, drinks and tip. Not bad! Especially for fresh, vegetarian ingredients that fill you up.  A fun and delicious time. If you are visiting AZ, make a trip for sure."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "SIMPLY, THE BEST! That is right. Hopefully, the song is running in your head as you read this review. My veggie friends all raved about Green when I moved here many moons ago. I am not one to buy into hype, but I definitely wanted to give it a try. I have now been there over 2 million times! Well, actually, more like a few dozen, but still, as many as I have been able to squeeze in. I take my veggie friends from far and wide, and they also fall in love with this place. I even brought my meat eating boss back a bar-b-que sandwich from here once, and he loved it! If you knew him - one of those guys that thinks anything labeled vegetarian is tasteless and disgusting - you would know what a big deal that is.  The food here is always wonderful. They have a great variety, and their unique inventions are always good too. I am a fan of bar-b-que, and their bar-b-que sandwich is delicious! It is as good as any bar-b-que I remember eating as a child when society forced me to eat the flesh of Earth's beautiful creatures. OK, I am being a bit dramatic. I would eat animal flesh bar-b-que with the zeal of a wild beast back then, and love it. But now I know better, and Green provides me the exquisite flavor of bar-b-que I loved as a beastly, carnivorous child without the need to murder innocents!  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I greatly enjoy their food.  I should mention, I do not mind the dining experience, but I suppose, from reading the other reviews, some may. You do have to stand in line to order your food, and at times, they can get very busy. So it might take some time to get your food. However, it has never taken a ridiculous amount of time, and most often it takes only a few minutes.  Luckily, I have had the pleasure of dining here with some great friends, and we always have no problem entertaining each other. Vegetarians are very intelligent, and some of the most interesting people I have met. My girlfriend is a carnivore, and she often has a hard time keeping up. I think grease congeals in their minds and slows everything down. JK! She is brilliant and beautiful, and she loves the food too.  Sorry if my review has been a bit silly and off point at times, but just thinking about Green makes me giddy. If you have not done so, I hope you visit them and enjoy the place as much as I do."}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "You knew this review was coming.  I made a switch to a plant based diet and I can't cook EVERY night.  Thank goodness for places like Green.  Green is like a Vegan restaurant for beginners.  It has a lot of mock meats made of things like Seitan so that newbies like me can have the mouth feel of meat without actually cheating.  I'm only eating a Vegan diet for health reasons, so I shouldn't eat fried foods or oils too often.  That said, Green has fantastic buffalo wings and fries!    On my first visit to Green, I definitely over-ordered.  For two people, we ordered the chili fries (chili on the side), the buffalo wings, the drunken mushroom chicken bowl and the apricot miso bowl.  This was twice as much food as two normal eaters need.    The drunken mushroom chicken bowl was FANTASTIC.  The mock chicken was delicious.  The mushrooms were so savory, it tasted like they were drenched in butter.  This bowl was the clear winner of the meal.  The chili fries were just okay for us.  I am not a huge fan of TVP when it is the only texture in a dish.  I love it in chili with beans, but otherwise, it is just not chewy enough for me.  The fries were good, but we didn't get any thyme flavor.  The buffalo wings were so yummy!  The first bite definitely didn't taste like chicken, but once you got the wing sauce in your mouth, you could imagine this was the real thing.  I happen to love buffalo wings, so for me to like these is a big win.  Go Green!  The apricot miso bowl with fried tofu was bland to me and offensive to my dining partner.  I just had a bite and felt it was quite under-seasoned.  He found the smell and the taste Godawful and he could not eat it after bite one.  Not being one to send it back, he just ate the rest of the stuff and left the bowl.  I packed up the leftovers, but it just wasn't appealing on Day 2.    The decor of the restaurant is best described as Berkeley hippie in a strip mall.  If I hadn't read the glowing reviews on Yelp, I would have walked out the door.  It just wasn't my vibe.  Still, they served up some phenomenal food.  It might be a good idea to do takeout.    One thing I did not care for was that it is a counter service place that requires you to add the tip in advance.  I always tip, but I am uncomfortable with this scenario.  I feel the tip should reflect the service.  On this particular visit, we didn't receive our chili fries until the meal was almost completed.  We were told five minutes prior to finishing the rest of our meal that the kitchen was working on a large catering order and wasn't good at multitasking.  That is not really an acceptable excuse!  Luckily, we had ordered SO MUCH FOOD it was not an issue.    Still, I will be back!"}

So every time we walk right up and get our food with no problems. Well right now I called and ordered ahead as usual, and when I got inside there was a long line, so I went ahead of the line like we usually do, and the cashier completely embarrassed me in front of everyone and yelled Who's next?! Oh wow, YOU are?! You're really going to cut ahead of all these people?!! I said I'm so sorry, the last cashier told me if it was takeout we could come straight up to pay, I'm sorry I'll go to the back I'm not trying to be rude. Where he proceeded to say very loudly no it's totally fine to cut everyone here, let me just ring you out!

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I'm glad I read the not-so-great reviews before going here. I was expecting it to be a healthy vegan restaurant. It's definitely not that. The place is cool on the inside, trendy with some interesting decor. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to you. I do have to admit, for a restaurant that calls itself Green I was disappointed to only see styrofoam and plastic cups. Booo!  I got the samosas as a starter. They were a little spicy but waaaay too garlicky. I love garlic like no other but the amount they put in there made it taste like fried spicy garlic cloves. No thanks. The dipping sauce was too sweet too. For $4.50 it was a disappointment.  I also got the diablo red with mock chicken and brown rice. The rice was good but everything else was SOOOOOOOO SALTY, oh my god. Major turn-off #1. Hint- Just cuz it has Tamari as an ingredient doesn't mean you have to drown the meat and veggies in it. My friend had the sweet and sour mock chicken. She liked it but the noodles didn't look pan fried at all. That's just ghetto if you ask me. Maybe I was seeing things (and that's very possible, don't quote me on it) but they just looked like boiled rice noodles thrown on there.  Overall, I've made better vegan food at home. I may give it another try though, get something else and see if it's less salty/garlicky/sweet."}

The mock meats are so good and so well prepared that you will forget it's mock. I LOVE the wings, especially the new jalapeño flavor and the original g or wendy's pickle are great choices, but so is everything else on the menu.  A tsoynami for dessert is a must, they have a long list of options, check them out, you will be in love.   You go up to the cashiers and grab a menu, take a seat and decide on your meal, then return the cashier to place your order. They will give you a number and bring out your meal, but there is no waiter service.   The ambiance is trendy, and laid back, very casual and welcoming."}

We also ordered dip (spinach/artichoke?) which was way too runny.  I ordered the golden arches style burger (forgot what it was called) and it had way too much special sauce on it which dripped out of the burger and made the texture too soft throughout (trying not to say mushy here).  We went Saturday night 1/28 and while it was busy and obviously popular, the food seemed like it was made by their second string cooks and we could only assume that their top staff had the night off maybe?? It's a bummer because we were only in town for that weekend anyway, but I really wanted to love it since their menu sounded so old fashion diner style good."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I should like Green. I have been a vegetarian for over ten years and I really like when I can go to a restaurant and eat whatever I want. I like the concept of Green, but after two tries, I can say with full confidence that I do not like Green.  Atmosphere: I have no problem with the heavy hipster vibe. In fact, it reminds me of home (ATX is a hipster Mecca during South by) and boyfriend and I make jokes about the decor while standing in line. What I dislike is the I don't give a damn attitude from the staff behind the counter. The first time we went to Green, I asked the guy behind the counter for a recommendation between two items. He scoffed at me: I guess if I *had* to pick, I would go with the sweet and sour. Wow. The second time, the girl behind the counter could not be bothered to greet us. She was too busy talking to the other girl behind the counter. When she finally saw that we weren't leaving, she took our order as if it was some great inconvenience to her. Sorry, dear. (Don't worry, I will not be back.)   Food: Boyfriend and I hated the food we have gotten here. First time: He ordered the greenza flatbread pizza and I ordered the sweet and sour. The pizza was an inedible mess of waxy cheese, soggy bread, and pesto. He ate two bites and pushed it away. I mostly liked my sweet and sour except for the fact it was drenched in the sweet and sour sauce. (Dear Green, I *like* the taste of vegetables and tofu, you do not have to hide those things from me. Sincerely, Liz) Second time: I ordered the No Harm Chickn Parm. I can say that the bread was good, but it's a bit too hard to mess up bread that you buy from a third party. The chickn was inedible. It tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency. I do not understand how some Yelpers said this was the best mock chicken they have ever eaten. Boca and Morning Star Farms are infinitely better (and cheaper). Boyfriend got the green hummus. He said it was good. Not worth $4, but good. The pita chips were over-fried--almost burnt. Icky.   Other:  1. The drinks are meh at best. All the drinks in the refrigerated case can be bought at Fry's or Whole Foods. Please do not waste your money.    2. There are not enough tables for the amount of people. I guess Green is to be treated like a coffee shop, not a restaurant. Plop down, claim your table, eat some noms, and surf the web. Do not leave for hours! I guess this is nice for some people, but it is impossible to get a table at dinner time. FYI  3. No AC in the restaurant during the summer. Unacceptable.   TL;DR: Waxy cheese, too much sauce, inedible mock meats. Don't go."}

No matter if you order online or pay a heady, you still get stuck waiting in line for 10-15 minutes while they assist others ordering. Then I get to the front of the line only to tell them I ordered online and then be handed my food. It's frustrating when you order and pay ahead just to avoid this. They should have an area specifically for To-Go orders. Again, nothing against the food because it is amazing!"}
{"stars": 4.0, "text": "Here is the equation for this review:   +5 stars for Tsoynamis:: So appropriately named: These things seriously pack the gale-force taste to knock your tongue-hut off of its timbers. Fun hand-mixed flavours to choose (Rocky Road -choc chips, choc syrup, walnuts, marshmallow...PB&J -peanut butter, grahams, strawberries...Almond Joy, S'mores, Don Quixote, and a Choco-Coffee Creation) or build your own...all with a base of their fantastic soft serve -*vegan* soft serve. True. These things are about 16oz...and a little natural disaster in a glass, so I recommend sharing if you are not plan to make it your meal. 3 words: Tsoynami for breakfast.   -2 stars for pizza and sandwiches:: These were just dissapointing. The Texas po'boy with portabello in their Espresso BBQ sauce sounded unique and delicious, but it was really a let down. The BBQ sauce was altogether too sweet. The peppers were sauteed to a point of sadness, and they just contributed even MORE sweetness to the dish. Really missed the BBQ mark (I am a 'que sauce executive, by the by). The hot-wing po'boy, however, seemed to have stolen ALL of the flavour and spice from the Texas. *Very* hot (I enjoy heat, so it was fine for me, but I caution more sensitive buds), and too greasy for my taste.  But the pizza was the BIG misfire. I had heard good things about the type of vegan cheese they use, so I definitely wanted to try that while we were in town. My mistake. I just have to face it. I am NOT into the melty-cheese thing (all of you dairy-dos are rolling your eyes...yes, I get it, the big 'duh' for the vegan girl). Horrible texture, taste and ALL too much of it. (Omni-mum agreed). Even scraping it off, the taste lingered. The sauce was nice, but the mushrooms and onions, again, were too oily, and the veggeroni was just store-bought yuck. (I was hoping for some home-made-less-processed seitan or something). The crust was just a thin flat-bread, which I do not like for pizza. The sauce was tasty...but too thinly spread (and affected by the yuck cheese).   +1 star for free fresh fruit substitute:: Seriously, how many times do you have to give a kidney in order to get some fruit or veggies subbed for a side? Thank you, Green, for being reasonable.  So, do the math and you have 4 stars. Seriously, the Tsoynamis did all of the work on that one. I am tempted to advise Green to just shut down the food side and roll out the Tsoynamis non-stop. However, my mum really liked the fries.   Next time we are in Phoenix, we will definitely go to Green again, but only for Tsoynamis...and maybe fries. I recommend you do the same."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I was hungry and decided to try out the Green in Tempe because my experience at the one in Phoenix was a long time ago, but very good from the memories I recalled.   We drove and found parking (slightly tight, because this place is busy and there are spots but not too many of them lying around) and proceeded to head in.  It was about 2:30PM at this point, so I assumed it would be settled down after a lunch rush. No such thing. This place was full, busy, and still churning out food like it never had been slow to begin with. That is a great start in my books.  We (I dragged my fella in tow for this stop) headed up to the counter and grabbed a menu and looked through what to get. When the line moved up and it was our turn we ordered, paid, and took a number to place on a table of our choosing. The staff was pleasant, although fairly quiet, but they moved us along politely and we waited.  While waiting for the food, we bought beverages which you can either grab from their fridge, or choose from 4 refillable drinks. We choose the refillable drinks and chugged away.  Green Tea (strong, deep flavor), Lemonade (mild lemon taste, not a ton of sugar), Limeade with Ginger (lime was a good taste, could not taste ginger), and I believe it is called Virmto (a medium weight beverage tasting like cherries, weirdly addicting, you should have a taste)  They bring our food and it was filling and just enough for lunch.  Spicy Buffalo Wings ($5.00) For those that don't like spice this was not too bad. It had more components of vinegar to the spice than actual heat. The wings were great soy chicken substitutes and I did not miss actual chicken in this. If the tartness of these is too much then go ahead and dunk them in the Vegan Cucumber Ranch that comes with it. It was some yummy ranch!  Artichoke Chicken Salad ($6.00/$9/00) We ended up getting the small salad and that was plenty for him and I to split. There was a Lemon-Tahini dressing that brightened up the greens very well, the salad leaves were dark & crisp, big pieces of artichoke strewn throughout the salad, and again the soy chicken was fantastic. You can tell it is fake with further inspection, regardless it still tastes fantastic (this was also prepared differently than the wings, it was a longer flat pieces where the wings were more like clusters of soy chicken).    Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich ($8.50) The chicken is prepared the same way in this sandwich as it was in the salad. The BBQ sauce had a tiny (I mean tiny) kick to it and was slightly messy to eat. Prepare for a burger stance with this one (elbows kicked out, looming over the sandwich aggressively). The Tahini Cole-Slaw was good, but had a lot of tahini and peanuts which overpowered the cabbage for me. The downside to the sandwich was the bun. The bun was a plain burger bun that was slightly stale and not that flavorable. The dryness of the bun against the sticky bbq sauce made a consistency that liked to get stuck in my mouth. Not the classiest thing to fix in front of other people, mind you.  With eating this food there were people that continued to come and go from the building non stop. The atmosphere is a bit hipster (staff was polite, but other guests really liked themselves and it was obvious) though I saw many suits, parents, and bros hanging out. Good melting pot!  Overall I think this place had great food, cheap prices, manageable crowds, and I could go back easily to try more items. Stay tuned, I need to go get a Tsoynami.  Cheers,  Messy Papers."}

They have a lot of different flavors, but they will also serve you plain vanilla soft serve if you want some simple indulgence !  In addition to the the delicious tsoynamis, there are a lot of options to choose from on their menu - from burgers, wraps, and fries, to fresh salads and food bowls (similar to what can be found in portland)  an all-vegan restaurant in the desert of phoenix/tempe.

Upon entering, I noticed another good friend of mine sitting at a table, waiting for the lunch he had ordered. He had been waiting for 15 minutes for his sandwich, and it took another 10 for it to arrive. Not a good sign! 25 minutes for a sandwich! They were busy..but he didn't order anything crazy.   It was hot inside. The first thing I notice when I walk into a building, is how comfortable the temperature is. Green made me sweat.  I ordered an iced latte which was amazing. To eat, I ordered the coconut curry with chikn. The buddy I brought along, ordered the same thing, but with crispy tofu. It took about 20 minutes for our food to be brought to our table..The potatoes in this dish were perfectly cooked, and tasty. Everything else in my bowl was mediocre...and actually kind of bland. The friend we ran into said Green's menu items are hit or miss. I will give it another try someday."}
{"stars": 5.0, "text": "On a recent 5 day trip to AZ, I went to Green 3 times. My boyfriend is from Mesa, and he loves this place and wanted to eat there as much as possible while we were in town for the holidays. I loved it! I can understand why he wanted to go here so much!  The first time we went I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich and eggless rolls. Both were very good. The chicken on the sandwich was very good as well as the sauce and the bun. I ordered fries as the side and they were the best fries of my life. Skinny little crispy but not too crunchy delicious fries. I pretty much hate all other fries now because of Green. The eggless rolls were good too and I really liked the sweet sauce they came with. My boyfriend ordered the original g spicy po-boy. It was good, but I think the sandwich I ordered was better.  The second time we went we split the no harm chicken parm and eggless rolls. It was that good.  The third time (second time in 1 day) we went we split the meatball po-boy and fries. It was really good! We also ordered a tsoynami that had chico sticks and chocolate chips in it. It was seriously like eating a Blizzard it was amazing!  I plan on trying to recreate it at home, but it probably won't be as good as Green's.   Green is a great place to go for vegans and non vegans. The prices are fair and the service is quick even though it seems busy all the time. They have a million drink choices and a varied menu. I also liked how you ordered at the counter, and bussed your own tables which I don't mind doing at all especially when there is a line of people waiting for seating. I will definitely go back several times next time I am in town."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I should preface this review by stating that I am not a vegetarian. I am especially not vegan. I am a shameless meat and diary eater. But I am open to experimenting with different cuisines and always looking to try healthier foods. Green is a restaurant that I've driven by countless times and always tell myself that I should give it a try. I finally did last night, and I wasn't terribly disappointed. While it's still not food that I would go out of my way for, I appreciate the level of quality Green offers.   I decided to take an adventurous route and try the original g spicy po-boy. I consider this adventurous because the idea of mock chicken doesn't sit well with me. The real thing tastes better and the health differential is open to debate. The sandwich was decent but small. It's only a po-boy in spirit. If you've ever been to New Orleans and had a po-boy, you'd know that they are obnoxiously oversized and stuffed with lettuce, tomato, and your choice of fish or meat. What saves this sandwich is the sauce. It's perfectly hot and the tofu absorbs all of its wonderful flavor. I like that Green uses mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce. It may take away the crunchiness, but I like the taste much better. Green also goes light on the mayo, which I appreciate. The thyme fires are really good. They're thin and crispy, and the herb really enhances the flavor. They give you a lot of fries, which makes up for the sandwich being a little undersized, but I'd rather have more sandwich than fries.   Since heaven forbid I be strong enough to pass up on sweets, I also tried a peanut butter chocolate bar. Not bad. But certainly not worth its $3 asking price. It reminds me of a store-bought peanut butter rice crispy treat. I recommend only having this if you are a strict vegan.   The restaurant is exactly what you'd expect it to look like. It's dark and artsy in a hipster bohemian style that you'd find in New York's West Village. It's semi-service. Order at the counter, wait at the table, and someone brings you your food. Green may want to look into assigning their customers a number, or a pager, to place on the table. Even though I was taking my order to go, I'm not a big fan of someone walking around and yelling names (way too fast food for me). They also may want to put their menus out near the front the place. They're all at the counter and there isn't a big menu board posted. How is someone new supposed to have a clue what's on your menu if they can't see it until they make it the place where you order?   A meat eater reviewing a vegetarian restaurant is like a vegan reviewing a steakhouse. I can appreciate the place for what it is, but it's just not designed for me. Green caters to a specific clientele that needs more restaurant options like this. I'm glad that there is a place like Green in the valley. It's everything that people who live this lifestyle can ask for. If you're a meat eater hoping for something that tastes just like normal food, you're obviously going to be disappointed. I'm certainly open to giving Green another try, and would even suggest it if I were planning on dining out with a vegan or vegetarian friend."}

The few menu items I can eat are really good especially the green salad and the balsamic picnic salad. HOWEVER, I confirmed with the cook and staff the canola oil is NOT organic which means it is Genetically Engineered (GE) canola oil. You must ask what the oil is if you are ordering something that is cooked, sauteed, etc. To avoid the GMOs ask for EVOO or organic canola. I was told the soy is organic and should be free of GMOs.

After reading all of these reviews on the crabcakes, we had to try them and I'm not sure what the big whoop was all about. Ours appeared to be kind of burnt and maybe that was the problem but I didn't actually care for the filling either.  Being out of towners, we weren't quite sure how the place works. So, we were actually sitting at a table for several minutes before we realized we had to order at the register.

I've gone to Green on several occasions and have tried something different every time (in hopes that I'll actually find something I truly like).   Nope. Didn't really happen, unfortunately, which makes me so so sad.  Pros:  Major props to the designer/decorator. I do like the concept of the place--most of the decorations/furniture seemed to be refurbished or recycled items. Can't complain about how creative and green the place is! Also, I like their concept of the tSoynami (soy-based ice-cream sundae mixed in with all sorts of candies/cereals/syrups/etc. of your choice. There's a million different pre-made combos you can choose from, but I'm sure you can customize your own as well.   Cons:  I'm just really underwhelmed with the main entrees and dishes. Perhaps I went in with too high of expectations? Out of the Bowls section of the menu, I've tried Singapore Orange, Thai Peaunut, and Drunken Mongolian. Honestly, I thought they all tasted the same. The flavors were heavily soy-sauce based (which is fine...I grew up eating lots of soy-sauce based dishes), but I really couldn't tell the difference between the three. I've also tried the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, the Original G Spicy Po-Boy and the Spicy Buffalo Wings form the menu as well. These were decent, but were super super high-in-sodium-tasting if you know what I mean.  Granted, I'm also a fan of meat, so vegetarian shops like Green may not be my greatest area of expertise. My comments, truly,  are more targeted towards the flavor combos and balances of the dishes here.   Overall, I like the concept of Green. If a vegetarian/vegan friend was in town for a week, I would probably bring him/her to Green to check the place out. Personally, though, I'm not sure I would crave Green enough to visit again on my own."}

Last night we stopped in after the Paso Robles wine tasting at FLEMINGS STEAK HOUSE... hey... we needed to counter all the flesh we saw being devoured....   and right before my eyes was the most magical and delicious creation known to man. Seriously. Like hands down best thing I have ever ever ever eaten. EVER!!  So, Green - if you don't put the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich on your full time menu, I think you are denying the good people of Arizona what they deserve: perfection.  An amazingly fresh and tasty roll topped with crispy bacon, chicken, mayo, fresh sliced avacado, CRISPY cheese, and jalapenos. Sure, doesn't sound that special...  BUT I ORDERED TWO. I wanted to order another. I want one right now. In fact, I cannot imagine a moment in my life where I won't be craving this amazing creation.  So - do yourself a favor.

It's like the restaurant is saying, We are vegen and we know it sucks, so we're gonna try to re-create all your favorite meat dishes! No thanks, I know there are good vegetarian dishes out there and if I want a pizza, I'll get a real pizza with real cheese! I guess this place is marketing solely to vegetarians and not regular omnivores. The pizza was horrible, and the ice cream was not the best I've had. Not good vegetarian food!  PRICE: Way too expensive for what you get. I don't remember the exact prices, but I remember questioning myself, Why did I pay that much for this? It has no high-priced meat in it!   ATMOSPHERE: Laid back place perfect for a college crowd. Easily sits large groups.   SKINNY: If you want vegetarian food, my suggestion is to get Muslim or Indian veggie dishes.

I'm saying this as a person who would wear a bacon strap wristwatch if someone invented one. They have things like Big Macs, wings, noodle dishes, just so many different kinds of food but there is no meat--just very close imitations of meat. You'll be able to get the savory taste of what you are craving and not feel like you're in a food coma afterwards. Whether you're into spicy food, basic foods, they have a great selection as well as a fridge full of many different types of sodas and drinks that are out of the norm.   I love the decor and the layout of the restaurant, but the location is a bit strange and some of the employees (repeat: SOME of the employees) are straight up arrogant. Being a restaurant like Green in a state like Arizona is a tough feat, so the staff should be more welcoming and not as smug. The person who ran our food was very friendly, however. She had cool tattoos running up her arms and a huge smile on her face--she basically saved the day as far as service goes.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really aren't a lot of options that don't involve faux meat.  Aren't these people vegan?  Don't they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!    I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that aren't nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.    Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.    I'll give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay."}

Not my smartest decision. I have to remember never to order anything with the work mock in it. It doesn't mock the real thing, I don't care what they say.   I did enjoy the fries and their artichoke dip was amazing. I even took home a very tasty cupcake.   I would come back and try something a little more reasonable, like a salad or noodles."}

Im a huge meat lover and was very skeptic when my friend raved on this place and insisted on going for dinner. I had the bbbq bacon burger just for the fascination of what vegetarian bacon would be like. Although it resembled nothing like bacon I really enjoyed the burger. The fries were awesome and the portion was good for the $9 I spent. Couldn't finish my fries but left uncomfortably full yet still satisfied. Definitely would be open to exploring the menu upon return."}

The vegan wings here were ok, but nothing like other places I've had. We were hoping they'd be more like buffalo wings, but the sauce was far more Asianic.    That said, everything we have ordered (dumplings, samosas, stir fries, sandwiches) has been good, just not quite outstanding.  I love their Thyme fries though -- delish.  Service was a bit slow, but I've learned that this is standard fare in vegan/veggie places, so it didn't bother us much. The people watching, plus artwork on the walls, made the time pass quickly, and the staff themselves were incredibly outgoing and friendly.  I definitely want to go back and try an Tsoynami -- they're just a little pricey.  Will have to wait till I'm really craving.  I love that they have lots of vegan items for sale; they have some hard to find things that lots of my vegan friends love. It's hard not to overspend.  I like their tea/limade/tamari drink options as well; can be fun if you mix them, and I love that their cups are compostable!  All in all, a great vegan spot to get something comforting, but can be a little pricey for a quick service style place."}

My husband had the thai peanut bowl. The beef was good but again there was next to no rice.  The order taker was very sweet but she was the only thing good about our restaurant experience."}

Luckily it planted a seed and another couple offered them a place at their table that was bigger.   Besides the seating and the wait for the food, there was so much that we wanted to try! The spicy edamame was great! I ordered the Curry noodles, they were nice and a great portion! My boyfriend ordered the fake CHicken Parm Sandwich... he liked it and had no complaints.

So the other night, my Husband decided we should try something totally different and go Green. I love trying new places, I was down for the challenge. As usual, I went onto to YELP and looked at reviews. They were pretty positive, so it was a go.  Well first of all I think people are just not honest. The ONLY reason to go to this restautant is if you are a vegan otherwise stay away.   First of all, we walk in and it is chaos. A nice sign indicating please seat yourself or order at counter would be very helpful. So we look over the menu. I have to admit the idea of mock meat just does not sound good.  Now don't get me wrong I go vegetarian all the time at restaurants. I have to admit that Chelsea's Kitchen makes an excellent black bean burger. Anyways, we start off with mock chicken wings, I would be lieing if I did not tell you I think I might have vomited a little in my mouth. So gross.   Next, we try some artichoke dip, that was actually good because it was semi normal. I order the veggie burger. I have eaten plenty of boca burgers in  my day, but this was just gross. WHen I order a veggie burger I don't need it to look like an actual burger patty. It was pink inside. Again, I could not even eat it, I thought I was going to be sick. If I wanted to get an actual burger, I would have gone to LGO and gotten a burger.  Needless to say, I will not be going back. Just riddle me this, if you don't eat me then why do you insist in making your food appear as meat??? I don't like tuna fish, and the last thing I would want is my steak to look and smell like tuna fish!!"}

It'd be my 1st stop once off the plane, & my last stop before getting back on the plane. Now that I live here, I practically live there.   This is some of the best veg*n comfort food on the planet. I've had @ 95% of the regular menu items. My favs are:  Big Wac: a vegan version of the Big Mac that could fool even a carnivore. Delicious & super filling. (Those with smaller appetites may want to cut it in 1/2 or share it.)   Wendy's Pickle: crispy fried chicken pieces w/ vegan mayo, a spicy sauce, & of course, pickles. An explosion of flavor for your taste buds.   Argentine Po'Boy: savory seitan steak with perfectly grilled & seasoned onions & peppers, plus mayo & spicy sauce. mmmmmm Mouth-watering!  Original G Spicy Po'Boy: mock chicken in a buffalo sauce w/ vegan mayo. I get mine sans tomatoes & extra spicy. Amazeballs!   (You can request light spicy sauce if you're spice sensitive.)   There's a BBQ chicken sandwich & a BBQ Bacon Burger. Both are equally so amazing that I have to eenie-meenie-miney-mo in order to choose. Their BBQ sauce is excellent!  All of the above come with a side. I suggest the thyme fries. So fresh & tasty!  When I need something on the lighter side, I get: the Jerk Salad w/ mock chicken instead of tofu. The jungle dressing makes me want to beat my chest & proclaim, Me Jane!    My 2nd favorite salad is the Ranchero salad, which features their yummy BBQ wings. Go all out and add a side order of their buffalo wings for an epic party in your mouth.   The chili fries are very good...in the winter. I personally can't do chili in the PHX summers.   Then the chef comes up with these amazing specials, which they announce on their social media pages. Today, I had the San Diego Fish Tacos: crispy tofu (& I'm not a tofu fan) mock fish, in soft tortillas, with a special sauce. SO good!!   Don't you dare leave here without trying a Tsoynami (think dairy-free Blizzard). My favs are:  Soy Capitan (for a fruity sensation); Dough Boy (cookie dough, chocolate syrup & soft serve. Hello!); Cookies n' Cream (classic); & my own creation of pretzels, chocolate, & toffee nut syrup.   They'll sometimes have fresh baked goods too.   There's a small selection of vegan groceries.   They have a cold case with a large selection of beverages, including a very tasty Butterscotch Beer (non-alcoholic).   Nice decor. They have plenty of tables, but on a busy night, or during the lunch rush, it fills up quickly. I suggest calling in your order if you're in a hurry. There's a patio outside, but there's only one table at this time. (This may change once the weather exits Hades.)   Order at the counter, then take a number & commandeer a table.   The parking lot was recently repaved & remodeled, which has made for a better parking situation.   Green. Don't leave Phoenix without it!"}

{"stars": 4.0, "text": "I recently discovered Green New Vegetarian restaurant when my diet needs changed. I was looking for something tasty yet vegan. I know, sounds like an oxymoron. I really did find some great things at Green. The business is in a nondescript retail Plaza on the west side of Scottsdale Road, to the south of the Salvation Army store. There is a small outdoor patio, which is nice. The inside is very clean and open, and lends to the trendy side. I especially appreciate the ice machine comma which is correctly labeled with a million small pictures of Ice Cube. There are some great selections on this menu. Let me interject by saying they also have a good selection of beer, wine and other drinks. On my first visit, I tried the classic veggie burger. It was really great. The burger was tasty and had a nice size. The thyme fries, while a little bit on the soggy side, were very tasty as well. On my second visit, I tried the buffalo chicken po-boy. I wasn't as big a fan of this sandwich. It was a very large portion comma and the buffalo sauce had a nice flavor. I think I was just not a fan of the mock chicken texture itself. Again, I had the thyme fries, and they were the same as before. On my most recent visit, I had the Thai peanut Rice Bowl. There was not a whole lot of rice, but just enough to accent the amazing amount of vegetables and perfectly marinated tofu. The sauce was a bit runny, but had a nice flavor. On this visit, a friend and I also ventured into the world of tsoynami. These cups of heaven come in many different flavors and are absolutely delicious non-dairy ice cream treats. We tried the s'mores flavor and also the cookie dough flavor. I could eat the cookie dough all by itself. As a matter of fact, they do sell the cookie dough comma which is also hilariously named DOH!. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting Green. Although, I did go in uniform a few times, and I don't think the guy there is too fond of me. Give this place a try!"}

My prediction: If you blindfolded an animal eater and they took a bite out of a big wac they wouldn't know it was not animal and would comment on how it was the best big mac they've ever had.  The only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the ordering situation could really be improved. There is always a long line with usually only 1 register and that person has to man the phone as well. Also there are not menus before you get to the desk to order so that slows things down more as ppl are still deciding at the register. Lastly, a pick up spot for ppl who phoned in takeout orders is needed."}

Everything was so good that I came back for lunch before heading to the airport to leave town.  On my second trip I got the BFF (fried chicken sandwich) and fries.  I travel extensively for work and have eaten at vegetarian/vegan restaurants all over the country.  This is one of the best ones I've ever been to.  It reminds me of Hip City Veg in Philly, if anyone has ever been there, but feels less like fast food and more like a cafe.  This is the type of vegan restaurant that you bring your carnivore friends to.  This is the type of place that makes them say Oh... this actually tastes good!  This is the type of place that has you asking How do they do it?  This isn't one of those vegetarian places that tries to be too healthy.  It serves burgers, milk shakes, and fried chicken sandwiches, but it is all delicious, and sometimes you want to indulge in a bacon cheeseburger with mayo - vegan style!

My first venture to Green was actually before I was a Vegan, I had just transitioned to trying vegetarianism and I thought  Wow, being a Vegan is easy!!  Well not exactly, but Green helps - unfortunately not all Vegan food is as creative or tasty.  Green isn't a health food place but some of there items are better for you then others. But you can be sure you are not getting a stack of cholesterol/saturated fat and animal protein to give you years of bad health and interesting diseases (yep I said it).  Pretty much everything is good at Green, I can only think of one so-so meal I have ever had and it was a special.  I am convinced it was not made correctly in the first place. The Spicy Po'Boy sandwich was my 1st and 2nd meal at Green and still a favorite, all the burgers are good, pizza is decent, bowls all taste similar but are all great. Appetizers are cheap and all good(try the hummus, non-wings, crabless puffs). Tsoynamis are incredible. Most of their specials are good, and don't forget about Green on holidays when you feel like not eating an animal(like the majority of folks). July 4th this year had an excellent spread and all for $5(which went to charity of course).  I forgot about the location a long time ago, yes the strip mall is nothing special and unsightly but who really cares. The atmosphere inside has improved over the years and all the people who work there and go there all seem to be quite chill(even the meat eaters). I just wish there was a second location closer to me in North-Cen Phoenix(maybe someday)  Phoenix doesn't have a ton of Vegan restaurants, but this place rivals other Vegan restaurants in much more Vegan friendly cities. My one complaint(or hope) is that someday they won't have to call things mock chicken and mock beef. I know this is to appeal to the masses and most people even in the Vegan community could care less but TVP, Seitan, etc all have a unique taste and texture and should be celebrated for that and called exactly what they are. Wheat meat,  Veggie meat, soy meat, whatever. Animal meat doesn't have the bounty on the word meat, what do you call the innards of a coconut or avocado? Ahhh now you get me, ok end of rant.  Go to Green, Carnivore or Herbivore, or anything in between, for the good food/atmosphere. Keep coming back for the reasons of why Green exists at all."}

While I have been eating a plant-based diet for a long time now, Green was really helpful when I first started because I could find vegan comfort food. When I got tired of beans and rice and vegetables, Green was a place where I could get variety and now understand that vegans have tons of food options.   My overall favorite meal there is the no-harm chicken parm, but I also love the bowls when I want something lighter (particularly Singapore orange and blonde Alfredo). I also can't avoid the tsoynamis, although I generally eat the entire thing at once and then feel crummy from sugar overload which is totally my fault. If you're vegan and are craving chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, try the dough boy tsoynami.  The staff is always friendly, and I love the diversity of people that come eat at Green.

It's a great to take your vegetarian friends and even more fun to take the meat eaters too.  I've probably had pretty much everything on their varied menu that consists of Asian to american and a few little twists in between.

If you like whatever it is on the menu at your favorite restaurant, you'll like it here too!  I absolutely love garlic and its a staple in most of their bowls and other items.  It's not overwhelming, but still noticeable and this is a  warning.  As for the tofu items, I've only sampled a bit and it seems to be good, but with the mock meats offered and how amazing they are from taste to texture, I save the tofu when I'm forced to go to some other vegan place that doesn't offer it and not quite as awesome either.

The thai noodle bowl was filling and the fries were good.The USP of this place i would say is the fact that they are Vegan and offer a Gluten free menu.The food is reasonably priced with decent portions.They also have outdoor seating.

As a vegetarian who was starving for some good food, I picked up a Green menu one day (dont know where I got it) and starting salavating at the menu options.  Lots and lots of options.    The first time I went I tried the po-boy sand.  It was good, but I wasnt too impressed as I could make something similar myself.  My daughter tried the crap puffs, and although she didnt like them (she's a true blue meat eater and knows the difference) I loved them.  Crisp, fried, deliciousness.  Their salads are delicious and their mock chicken anything is very good.  They even have chili fries- yummy!  Havent tried the soynami shakes.  I am always too full when I leave there to even think about dessert, but after reading the reviews I will have to try one now."}

It's great to be able to enjoy a BBQ pulled pork sandwich or crab puffs... without having to sacrifice an animal.  More restaurants now are becoming vegetarian friendly, but there is something to be said about not having to choose between a salad and a Portobello burger, I can eat everything on the menu!   My absolute favorites are the thyme fries, Texas Moo-shroom Po-boy , and the orccietta pasta.  The food is tasty, but the atmosphere reminds me of a local dive bar.  I have only eaten in the restaurant twice; it's kind of an artsy place and not really my style.  I order takeout regularly though, the service is great and the cashier is always super friendly.  My boyfriend is a meat eater, and enjoys their food, he actually suggests it!   I recommend substituting Green for your next trip to Chili's and see what you think. I think you will be pleased, especially as a vegetarian or vegan."}

When I first tried this place I was honestly not super open-minded I remember not being super thrilled being that I am not vegan myself. I have always been conscious of what I ate and have always tried to make healthy choices so I decided to give it a shot.   A year later, I can say this is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley, funny how that happens sometimes. Unfortunately I cannot review too much of the menu items because once I tried their vegan burger I have been loyal to it since. The vegan burger is so incredible and probably the closest tasting to real meat that you can get! The thyme fries are also a great add on to the meal as well! I have also ordered the Po-Boy which is a buffalo chicken sandwich which is also incredible as well and I occasionally switch up my pallet with that as well.   Before you leave this place however you have to try their famous tsoynami! Again, I only have tried one flavor, which is the cookie dough one, and I add mint which is so YUMMY. Their vegan cookie dough is so delicious I have to get it every time I am there.   All in all I could talk about this place for days or you could just make the right choice and try it for yourself! You seriously will not be disappointed."}

I'd recommend a rice or noodle bowl of some sort - I love the sweet n sour one.  I've had the burgers and pizzas before and I don't think they are as tasty - fake cheese just doesn't cut it sometimes.  But the noodle or rice bowls are worth coming back for over and over again.  Local art on the walls and counter-style service really make it a great place to meet for lunch or dinner."}

I love real veg restaurants, they are so few and far between all those places that just serve a veggie wrap and think they are opening up their client base. You can tell Green is the real deal because they list chicken sandwiches, meatballs this, shaved beef that all without blinking.  I went for the original g spicy po'boy and the tahini coleslaw (say what?), followed by a small tsoynami...and perhaps a mini chocolate peanut butter bar. what, it's all health food right?   the po'boy, i will admit looked a little po with only 3 pieces of spicy chicken, but the flavor was great and i even thought (mayonnaise hater that I am) that the vegan mayo added to the flavor and richness of the sandwich. the coleslaw was just delightful, and i would never have been able to tell that my soft serve was vegan in a blind taste test.  i just saw Eric's review about the mint syrup and chocolate chips, so i'm heading back there for an after-dessert dessert.  the atmosphere is spare, i feel like they could toss a few more tables in there, on the left side where the tables were really far away from one another. There was cool soft music, and I liked that they have two sofas to chill on, and a mini market full of vegan goodies like meatless beef jerky and paul newman's pretzels.    Oh Green, you and I have such good times ahead of us...please bring napkins."}

{"stars": 5.0, "text": "First off, I am not Vegan....not even slightly. I love myself a good slice of fish or some wholesome chicken like the next guy. However, I have shifted my lifestyle choices recently to a more healthy overall track. So keep that in mind when reading forward.  Green is the first mock food joint I have ever eaten at. Considering the reviews of fellow Yelpers, I took my fiance over here to check it out. We both were cautiously optimistic about the abundance of options on the menu. Laura (my fiance) chose a mock meatball spaghetti, the Orecciette pasta. The mock meatballs tasted more like falafel than meat, however the sauce and earlobe pasta was amazing. Also added in were the veggies within the pasta....overall she really chose an awesome dish.  I chose the seemingly popular Original g spicy po-boy sandwich, with curry pasta. Biting into the mock chicken, you could tell it was not real chicken per say..its obvious. BUT, the amazingly tasty flavors along with the buffalo sauce just run rampantly on your taste buds. The curry pasta I got as my side was as good, if not better than the sandwich itself...I could eat that curry pasta all day.  So, with that said, two dishes tried, both tasted AMAZING. You can tell the food is not real, but does it matter when the food tastes so great? I'll answer that for you with a resounding no...no it doesn't matter. It gets 5 stars just for the fact that the culinary experience may be different, but the end result is significant satisfaction on multiple levels. Think about it:  its great for you, the soy products within are amazingly healthy and everything is organic for the most part when you eat here. I will definitely be making plans to set aside a few $'s just for a Green Fund so I can eat here at least a couple times a month. Will re-post when I try something else...perhaps the pizza??? Will update soon!!!"}

But as a life long veggo I was super excited that there was a comfort food all vegetarian restaurant in the valley, that wasn't too strange. Finally!  It was different than what I expected inside... much more casual I guess. Counter service and fending for yourself over finding a table. I thought the decor was pretty unique and cool though.  I liked the selection of teas and lemonades. The green tea was yummy.  For starters we had the artichoke dip and crab puffs. Both were delicious but we were a little disappointed with the serving size of the crab puffs. 4 little pieces...  3 of us had the Po-Boy sandwiches. I had already tried a piece of the buffalo chicken at Devoured so I knew I would like the sandwich. They did not disappoint! All the components of the sandwich were good. The bread tasted bakery fresh and even the vegan mayo was good! It tasted just like real mayo. The shoestrings were hot and crispy, like upgrades fast food fries. My husband had the no harm chicken parm, which he thought was good but not great. He didn't like the texture of the cheese.  Kinda wish they had a liquor license... a glass of  wine or a brewsky would definitely enhance the meal. It seems like a lot of vegetarian eateries don't serve alcohol. What a shame.  We will definitely be back. There are so many other dishes I want to try!"}

Don't get me wrong, your fries are great, but 2 of us were really craving some of your cole slaw. Bad on us for not checking when we picked up, but I sent my husband to grab the goods. The big wac wasn't as great as it usually is. There was a definite lack of sauce, which I believe makes this mock burger so great! Haven't placed a to-go order in a while, because during busy times you can see your to-go order sitting on the counter, ready, while you have to wait in line to pick up & pay for it while others are in line deciding what to order. If I had the time to dine in, I wouldn't mind, but I am picking up a to-go order due to my lack of time. We love your restaurant, but the customer service isn't what it used to be either. We have been coming here since becoming vegan in 2013. Wanted to keep giving Green a chance, because we love your restaurant, but don't feel like our business with you is important anymore.

Back to the food -- The mock chicken was pretty good, I could eat this in place of real chicken any day! I couldn't even tell it was mock chicken. The No-Harm-Chicken-Parm Sandwich was so tasty and big enough to share between two. The Thai Peanut Bowl was just right, not to heavy, not to light. It's healthy, very flavorful, filling, and you can tell you're getting all the right nutrients!   Desert was one of the best parts of our meal. Forget Ben&Jerry's, now I'm always going to be craving the Coffee Co Loco Ice Cream . One thing that's very surprising about is that they place soy ice cream in the mix with coffee grinds. I know, coffee grinds? The coffee grinds are neither dry or bitter, its almost like they're mini vanilla beans or even sprinkles of chocolate. They also place chocolate and coco puffs. What I wonder is how do the coco puffs never get soggy? They're in the bottom of the ice cream and they're still crunchy.   Overall, I'm a definite fan of Green -- Makes me think if I could turn Vegan.  Con: For optimal studying purposes, I wish they had just a tad more light (Day light bulbs)"}

I don't ever think I'm getting healthy food when coming here it's definitely junk food as Ben H. said, but throughout the years, it's been a safe haven for me to go to with my crazy vegan friends. There just aren't that many good places for vegans in Phoenix-- especially for good old fashioned American food. Sure you can get vegan options at Indian, Ethiopian, and Asian places...but sometimes you just want that chicken parm sammy or that big burger that your diet or lifestyle choices must keep you from. Enter Green. Fast, relatively cheap, greasy comfort food. A little something for everyone and some of the finest faux-meats I have ever had. I really love the chicken cutlets and the steak sandwich is my absolute favorite. This is not for the weak of heart-- these creations are masterful and oily, but they sure do fill you up. Save some room though, you can't leave here without getting a Soynami--basically a McFlurry type thing made with soft serve coconut milk. It's amazing.

The wings were delicious and amazingly real in texture and taste.  The tsoynamis are freakin' awesome - the first one I had a few years ago, I didn't really think the texture was quite right.  But I definitely think its exactly like a blizzard but with better flavors, like fluffer-nutter (pb, banana, marshmallow fluff. yum)  But nothing beats the old standby of a no harm chicken parm with chili fries on the side.

I don't come here too often since I am not a vegetarian. But when I do I am always amazed by how much flavor is in their food and how I don't miss the meat at all. The only thing keeping them from four or five stars is the fact that they don't publish the nutrition information for their menu. I suspect that the reason their food tastes so good is because it probably has more sugar and salt in the sauces than I would want. Just because it is vegetarian doesn't mean it is low on calories. But I know that is not a concern for everyone..."}

However, I am not inclined to absolutely rave about how great their vegan cuisine is.   To begin, I think they're salads and some of their appetizers and sandwiches are crisp and fresh and delicious. Some of the pastas and other items that require any oil or things of that nature, seem to be drenched in it. It's busy a lot, which excites me because it makes me think there is a more prevalent health conscious or environmentally friendly population out there.   Wrapping this little blurb up; this restaurant might eliminate any notions some people have who firmly believe in the stigma that all vegetarian/vegan friendly food tastes like cardboard. Notions like that are probably crushed there by any noob who walks through those doors and that in itself is a worthy accomplishment!"}

Just eat tofu and alot of vegetables.   Overall the food was good and the atmosphere is quirky but I was really disappointed that the vegan meal we had wasn't as healthy as I thought it woul be."}

The food portions were huge. The hummus was good, but a bit too salty. The chicken shawarma was nicely seasoned in general, but was all dark meat, which I don't care for. Also, the garlic sauce was more like garlic mayonnaise, which I also dislike.

I wanted this place to be the Gem that I just found at the pho place next door. It was not! Sooooo, let me get to it. First BEWARE the yogurt soda . This is definately something you would have to spend alot of time with. It is exactly what it says it is. Imagine plain, unsweetened yogurt, you drop in plain, unflavored unsweetened soda water in and then add a tablespoon of salt. Sound good. Fuck no! And it is not.  Next.....!  Falafel: Meh! The croquettes could have been crispier on the outside and definately need a lot more flovor to these heavenly middle-eastern balls of goodness. The pickle was actually the best part.  The pita is NOT MADE FRESH!! Some reviews say they are but I can tell you the pita's came from a bag.  Gyro: Meh! The reason for the cone shaped meat loaf of lamb and beef is so the outside cooks quickly buy turning past extremely high heat and the inside stays moist as it is sliced away from the cone. In my Gyro there were no cooke meat ends, in fact it was just inside Gyro meat. I assume this is because they are busy and the outside meat was never given a chance to cook up again.....you see the inside becomes the outsude every slice of the way. I did not have nearly enough tzatziki, no cucumbers, no olive, no red onion. All essential in creating a tasty ass Gyro. I still contend that Jay's Gyros in Tempe are supreme!!  Lamb Tongue Sandwich: Lettuce, Tomato, Tongue wrapped in a bagged pita!! Boring. Dry. The Lamb Tongue is served in the pita WHOLE. I thought it would be sliced but it was'nt. Two little lamb tongue's boiled with ZERO flavor. Baba Gahnoush: OK......... Hummus: OK....... (Pita Jungle has a much heartier flavor on both items) Baklavah: We have a winner!!!! Some of the best I have tasted in recent memory. That will be my reason for a follow up.  I thought it was cool that they sold prayer mat's. The service is ok, nothing bad and nothing over the top."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Anyone that knows me knows I only review places I love. I'm no negative Nancy and I refuse to bring down small businesses for simple mistakes. On that note this will be my first and hopefully only bad review I ever have to give.   Before I get into the bad stuff, I have to say that the only reason I gave this place any stars at all is because of the food. If I was reviewing just the food it would be 4 stars. Its the best middle eastern food I've had here so far and I MIGHT return just because it was so good but I'll definitely be taking it to go and will only cave when I really want some chicken Kabob.   Ok now onto the bad stuff. We were greeted by a waiter that seemed nice enough and he sat us down in the store section. As we waited quite a while to be attended we decided we would get the food to go and maybe just eat a bit at our table ( we were starving) and then finish it at home. So we politely told the waiter we would just order the food at the counter and he nicely agreed it wouldn't be a problem. Once we got our food we opened up our togo boxes and started eating quickly so that we could leave asap. Suddenly another waiter (some Asian guy, seemed like the only Asian worker there) decided to rudefully scold us in front of the other customers for staying to eat there when we had ordered our food to go. I manage a restaurant and I always make sure I don't make the workers life more difficult than need be it so I couldn't understand what he was bothered about. There were no customers waiting for tables (plenty of open tables), they weren't closing yet and we were sitting at the table the original waiter had sat us at to begin with. I honestly saw no reason for the rude scolding we had just received. Due to his terrible attitude we decided to finish our plates there and take our time (yeah I decided to be a B**** after being yelled at by a stranger, sue me) and then he still decided to come back and angrily tell us how they usually close that section earlier to which I replied ok. I didn't want to argue with him but if we had decided to eat there that would have been the table we were GIVEN. So his bad attitude was a load of s**t. After that he kept coming back to that section and mumbling stuff under his breath and staring at us. He was a jerk and should be fired. Like I said, I manage a restaurant so I know what its like to have a bad day and sometimes accidentally let it out on someone. If he had been rude and then apologized for his bad attitude (as I have to customers) I wouldn't even be writing this. But that guy was an as*hole and doesn't deserve to work a job where he has to deal with people. Keep him in the back washing dishes or something. If I were them, I'd consider getting rid of him and hiring someone with some people skills."}

The kabobs were not bad, they just weren't anything special.  The big disappointment was the rice.  It did not taste like basmati and did not have the saffron I'm used to seeing with rice when I order koubideh elsewhere.  There was a strange musty smell and taste to the rice that we just couldn't place.  We left most of the rice, and some of the kabob on the plate.  This would have been a two star experience if it hadn't been for the amazing selection of different types of baklava for sale in the little store.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I purposely didn't read the Yelp reviews before coming here so that I wouldn't have any preconceived notions about this place. I wanted to check this place out with fresh eyes. Some of my points here have been shared many times over in previous reviews but again, I purposely didn't read them so this review is from my eyes as a virgin visitor.  My son and I came here last night before heading to Gammage for a play. My first thought upon entering was Am I in the wrong the place? Haji-Baba is a small ethnic market as well as having a small eatery inside. It is an older store and the restaurant is off to the far right side of the store. In fact, the restaurant seems like an afterthought. There are very old tables and chairs, with the cheapest silverware, napkins, plates and glasses that the restaurant supply stores carry. There is no personality to this part of the store at all. And while that isn't entirely a bad thing because I'm not afraid to visit a dive restaurant, in the case of Haji-Baba, this was just a sign of things to come.   Despite being severely overdressed, we were seated at a nearby table by a polite man who came across like one of the owners. Unfortunately, he was not our server. Our server was a man who was barely audible when he did speak to us, which was nominal at best; which is to say that he said just enough to get our order and then never came back again. Our dinners came out in less than 5 minutes..which seemed very surprising to me. Although our dishes are not complex, nor is the menu as there are limited selections at Haji-Baba, I thought that there might be a little more effort, especially now that I've read so many other reviews on this place. The food was clearly pre-made and just scooped on the plate. I guess that's ok and maybe I'm spoiled and used to cooked-to-order food lately. Hard to say.  The food itself was pretty good. My schwarma plate came with tabouli, hummus, rice, schwarma and 1/2 of a pita. My son's beef schwarma had rice, greek salad and schwarma. No hummus for him and he had the other 1/2 of my pita. Both of the schwarmas were fine. It was nothing special. I've had better and I've had worse. The hummus was creamy though kind of bland and the pitas were warm and flavorful...when we got more! Our first one was kind of blah. The rice was just plain white rice. The Greek salad was way overdressed to the point of soggy. The tabouli was nice though with just the right amount of crunch.   Overall, this would have been a 3 star review if not for the lackluster service we received. Our server had zero personality. He never came back to check on us though he stopped at several tables near us to give them a thumbs up to check on them so maybe it was just us and the fact that we were dressed up that put him off. I thought initially that he might not have been comfortable speaking English as clearly most of the staff here were European but he spoke beautifully to the tables around us. Our drink vessels were bone dry. I had to flag down the guy who seated us to get extra pitas and refills on our drinks. Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll go the 1/2 mile up the street to Pita Jungle for Mediterranean food. The service was better and the food had some heart put into the process of preparation. Haji-Baba was, in a word, forgettable and that's kind of a shame because with a little work, it could be the 5 star place that so many people on here seem to think it is."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "There are two distinct kinds of friends who have given me their accounts of Haji Baba, a long-time Middle Eastern culinary institution in Tempe: Arizona natives/ASU alums, and Middle Easterners.  Arizona natives/ASU alums: Why do you go to all these other Middle Eastern places? Haji Baba is the best! The best, I tell you. Are you even listening to me? It's awesome! And cheap! I'd go there after Econ 102 every Tuesday and Thursday. No need to go to any of these other places, see? Haji Baba is the best. Now, go!  Middle Easterners: My friend, why do you want to go here? How is it, you ask me? Meh. It is just ok food. They give you a lot of food, but nothing tasting very special, you know? If you go here, just do your shopping and eat somewhere else.  And with those distinct camps of opinion, it's no wonder that it took 21 months for me to set foot in here. But I finally did so a few nights ago...  Haji Baba is another store/restaurant hybrid, which seems to be the M.O. of most Middle Eastern establishments here in the Valley. The store, to the left-hand side, had a pretty good-sized selection of Middle Eastern goods, except you can obviously tell that this place is right by a college campus, with the near-entirety of one long shelving unit dedicated to every flavor of hookah tobacco known to man. I didn't spot a durian, rhubarb, or garlic-flavored tobacco during my initial scan, but I'm sure they were in there somewhere.  The separate dining area is to the right, except for two small tables on the store-side of the wall. Which is where the waiter decided to seat me, even though there were open tables of equal size in the dining area. I thought this was a little odd. Was I being sequestered for some reason? I didn't think I looked disheveled, but what do I know.   Anyway, I ordered some baba ganoush with pita for appetizer and then the chicken shawarma combination plate for entree. I'll agree about the prices. They did seem very reasonable (the combination plate was $6-something). Also, they had choices of either Arabic-style or Persian-style kabobs, which I pretty much never see in the same restaurant.   As I waited for my food, I was given a tall, frosted plastic cup full of ice water. The problem was, though, that the cup was so tall that my accompanying straw completely disappeared as soon as I dropped it in. Oh well.  My baba ganush arrived and it looked really great. However, the taste was so mild that you could barely distinguish it from hummus. You'd have no inkling whatsoever that this was eggplant mush. It had none of the smoky, slightly bitter flavor that baba ganush is known for. Which is fine. Maybe milder, meeker, less potentially offensive flavors are the way to go in a college setting, but I was a little disappointed.  Then came my chicken shawarma entree, which had a sizeable pile of the aforementioned chicken plus hummus, tabbouleh, rice, and more pita. I could see how as a college student that this would be a great value. Even as a working professional, this was still good value. In front of me was a lot of food for not much money. They were generous with the amount of chicken they gave, a rare sight in many of these restaurants. But again, hoping for amazing things, I was underwhelmed by the taste of each of the elements. Not that any of the items tasted bad, but that their flavors were more muted than other Middle Eastern establishments I've been to in the Valley, which I can say now is more than a small handful.   That said, Haji Baba did succeed in one thing - too *much* food. I was so full that I left with a lot of my rice and pita left over, which pretty much never happens.   So in the end, what do I make of this crowded, local ASU favorite?   5 words: It is ok, my friend.  3 stars."}

I agreed to go to this place only after reading all of these glorious reviews on Yelp, only to be in for a rude awakening upon my arrival.    I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the phrase you get what you pay for has never rang more true for me.  I love Middle Eastern food, like seriously, no joke.  So how excited was I to try a new Middle Eastern restaurant not too far from my office with ridiculously low prices?? You can probably figure it out from there.  The meal started out okay.  I got a pretty darn big piece of Spanakopita for $1.95, which excited me.  It was decent, not very flavorful to be honest but for $1.95 I'll eat them all day long. My boss ordered a side of hummus to start, and his story was pretty much the same.  We then both ordered the Chicken Kabob sandwich for a whopping $3.99 and I was stoked. Until it arrived that is.  I took one bite and could tell right away that something was not right, with the chicken I mean.  After I taste a funky piece of meat, that's it. I will not be taking another bite. It just won't happen.  I did however perform a little surgery on one piece on a side plate to discover that as I suspected, the inside was pink, as in NOT FULLY COOKED.  It took a bit out of me to not get sick right there at the table.  I was hungry though so I tried to eat around the chicken, only to discover that this was the dryest chicken kabob sandwich I had ever had.  I probably should've figured that out by watching my boss douse his with the entire appetizer of hummus to add some flavor, but what can I say, I like to figure some things out on my own.  All in all my meal ending up costing less than $6, which was sweet, except for the fact that I didn't really eat anything.  Oh, and I should probably mention that we got back to the office and my boss didn't stop bitching all afternoon about how badly his stomach hurt. I believe that's called salmonella : )  Anyways, I'm a bit surprised that I had such a lousy experience with so many great reviews before me.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe all the reviewers before me were blinded by the price, regardless, I won't be back to find out."}

The food was good, hummus though was very good. We had a nice array of salads, gyros, shwarmas, hummus, spanikopita, baklava, etc. All sorts of shit was at the table, and it was all good, but none of it made me go oh man this is the best I've ever had.   I'd return for two reasons, one is the price. Dinner for 4 with more than we could eat was less than $30. reason two is the great service. We didn't more than 5 minutes for ANYthing.

Haji-Baba is SUPER popular as you can see by the Yelp reviews of this place.  The main reason for their popularity I think is due to their prices.  Their prices are almost ridiculously low for the portion sizes you get when compared to other Mediterranean ~ Greek type of restaurants.       I did find something I liked at Haji-Baba. I recommend you try their Gyros.  It's a really good Gyros and is one of the best in the Phoenix metro.  They don't shave their Gyros meat like at the other places.  They cut their Gyros meat off in long chunks, different sizes.  This adds another level of delicious-ness when compared to Gyros at other locations.    They OVER STUFF their Gyros with meat, a small amount of tomatoes, red onions and pickled wild cucumbers with some tzatziki sauce.  The pickled wild cucumbers were unexpected and a nice change from other plaecs that serve Gyros.  My Gyros needed a bit more tzatziki, but my server was slammed and forgot it, oh well.  As for everything else on their menu ~ meh, I've had better.  Their dolmades, rice and kibbee all tasted old and over cooked.  The shawarma and falafels also tasted over cooked and were very dry for my liking.    Restaurant location and condition~ 2 to 3 stars Service ~ 3 stars Food ~ 2 to 3 stars (except for the Gyros which are 4.5 stars) Prices ~ 5 plus stars  I'm looking forward to going back for another Gyros and maybe I'll try their hummus and/or a Greek salad on my next.

Pros - best halvah I ever had at the deli - joyva brand brought in from New York in large wedges.   Falafel was one of the best - moist inside and more a half ball with a flat side than a ball or oval.    Got the shish kabob - it was well charred on one side and that affected the flavor but it was not burned so bad it could not be eaten. There was no flavor like it was never marinated and not even the typical slightly gamy lamb flavor, just bland and on the tough side.  Dressing on salad was regular Italian and plenty put on rather than a Mediterranean dressing.  Also got the combination.  Gyro was fine - typical taste and texture.  Tabooli about 90% parsley which was ok.  Kibbi had no meat (could not see, feel, or taste any).  It was a nice piece of bread but not what was expected.  Dolmas flavor was ok but the grape leaves were very tough taking effort to bite thru and chew.

This place is on the cusp of greatness but is held back with weak supporting dishes.  When I come here I normally get the Sultani or the mixed kabob plate. While the meat is tender, moist, and grilled to perfection it is complemented by subpar basmati rice or hummus that tastes like it came straight from a can. The tabbouleh is ok though.  Their appetizers are also on the wrong side of mediocrity. In addition to the gastronomic catastrophe that they call hummus, their sambusek and fuul is also thoroughly unimpressive. I have lived in Egypt so I know what good fuul tastes like and trust me that is not it. It tasted like it came straight from the can.     Lets end on a positive note though. The meat is succulent and by in large the food is reasonably priced and the service is prompt and friendly. In addition adjoining the eating area is a small market so if you need halal meat in Tempe or any other essentials of Muslim cuisine its worth your time to grab lunch and then do some shopping."}

I paid $12 for the lamb kabob. I asked for the kabobs to be grilled RED on the inside.  Server said OK, but when the kabobs came 9and there were only 5 one inch cubes or so, I wish there were more for the $12, some were well-done, kinda hard and dry, not even pink inside.  Some were pink but none were red on inside.  I told the server but he said that's the way we make them, we grill them all the same.  If we made them rare, people can't chew them.  Well I don't mean THAT raw, but I find anything cooked longer than red on the inside, makes it kinda tough.  Even lamb.  Taste was just A -OK, but I could smell the charbroil.  Years ago, I ordered the lamb tongue sandwich.  It turned out to be whole lamb tongue all hanging out of the bread and wagging and lollying at you !!!  Kinda gross to bite down on the whole tongues and shut them up, but someone ordered the lamb tongue this most recent visit and the tongue was sliced.

Fortunately, she booked in for another tattoo a couple of days ago which gave us another excuse to travel the 45 miles and have another bite at the Casa la Dinge. Unfortunately, the way the day played out meant that I headed in to Tempe with her, then had to kill about three hours waiting for her tattoo to be completed. During this time I met some friends and because I was starving I wound up having a quasi-lunch with them at Slices Pizza at the cnr of 6th and Mill. Doh! The wife wouldn't have tolerated me doing Haji Baba's with them because SHE wanted to join me at HB for a late lunch. I thus had two lunches on the day, but because I wasn't too hungry after she and I arrived at HB, I had to make do with a couple of appetizers. I ordered the Foul Mudammas, the falafel and the yoghurt soda. The soda made me shudder at the unexpected taste, but I did manage to strangle down about half of it, with a face that probably appeared to onlookers as though I was being cornholed with a pineapple. Reminded me a lot of salt lassi, except this was saltier. Basically like drinking salty melted butter out of a bag of Orville Redenbacher. The wife grimaced at her first swallow, then came back a few minutes later for another go-round (that's my girl!) I can see why the damn stuff is popular - in a Warheads-candy sort of way. The Mudammas was pretty good, but my gut was quite full by this time and I didn't even finish the falafels. Oh well. Wife had the chicken kabob, same as last time I think - the plate was overloaded and the food was delicious, once again.  After we finished I started with the usual wandering up and down the aisles looking at the weird foods and their names. Wife said she needed to hit the restroom. About a minute later she was back, with sort of a guilty wan smile on her face. I was wondering whether the crapper was out of order or something else funny had happened. I was wrong. Apparently the previous occupant had dropped a couple of foul mudammas of his own in the bog, and the stench was so rancid that my wife threw up almost all of her meal. I kid you not. She said she struggled to hold her breath but in the end, blammo. By this time I was doing the potty dance as well and with more than a little trepidation went to the restroom. I sniffed (WHY?!) but the smell had cleared out by now and it was tolerable. However, the toilet fixtures themselves were disgraceful. I took a couple of photos of the faucet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=R-J7WlBAZ7cGGRMTetoRxA), and the string holding their mirror above the sink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=DkWNs54J3xmfmZ1KHX2CbA). If they're going for realistic Arabic slum atmosphere and decor at this place, congrats - they hit the mark one hundred percent. Please, DON'T go into the restroom if you visit this place.. you'll spend the rest of the day, like I did, wondering if the kitchen fixtures look the same. Spoiled the experience for me, and there's NO reason they can't renovate such a tiny room and make it at least a little more passable. Made the shitter in Trainspotting look like the jewelry counter at Harrods.  Three stars (two knocked off for the state of the restroom, and I'm not counting the stench/vomiting incident in this demerit), and my brief addiction has been broken. I probably won't go here again since it transcends even my fairly liberal, old-city standards of cleanliness. Cheap food, good tasting, generous portions, I didn't get food poisoning, and the cashew baklava was awesome, but next time we're in town I'll probably go back to Slices Pizza or look for an alternate Middle Eastern fix.

It is ridiculously inexpensive, and for the money, I thought the food was decent.  We started with the homus.  I didn't think it was great, but it was okay.  The pita bread it was served with was nothing special, similar to the pita pockets from any supermarket.  The Arabic bread my lunch was served with was much better, a soft flat bread.  I had the chicken shawarma plate which was served with rice and tabouli.  The tabouli was very good, although I don't much care for tabouli in general...or rice.  So I'm not sure why I ordered the plate instead of the sandwich.  Maybe I just wanted to see more food on my plate.  That sounds like me.  The flavor of the shawarma was good, but I was really disappointed in the chicken.  It was everything from larger chunks of meat to itty bitty little scraps, mostly scraps.  But again, dirt cheap so you can only complain so much.  We also browsed in the grocery part and picked up some packaged goodies and 2 pieces of baklava.  Probably some of the best baklava I have had!  They were out of the pecan variety, but there was also almond, pistachio, and cashew to choose from.  It was something crazy like a buck a piece.

The strengths: very large portions of food, all of which are appealing even to people who are not familiar with middle eastern cuisine; low prices; an ethnic grocery attached which is a pleasant diversion while you are waiting for your food.    The weaknesses: virtually everything is underspiced, so you get tired of it after two or three bytes.  Apparently, lemon and garlic are spices-non-grata in this kitchen, and even salt and pepper are used sparingly.  For $2.60 you get enough hummous for two, as an appetiser, but you won't want to finish it.  It reminds me a lot of paste.  And the pita (bread) was going stale. Exceptions: their take on a meat-stuffed eggroll, and, believe it or not, the gyros.  Also well-spiced: a variety of sauces which helps offset the blandness of the food.  I must also comment on the tabouleh (which here means ground parsley) served as a huge mound on most plates; it would feed a baseball team, but it, too, is tasteless.  Other, much smaller, issues: it can get crowded, the ambiance does not exist, and they have an odd system for paying your check which puts you in a line with the people buying groceries and can be slow.  Hints: 1.  Order the Combination plate.  For $12 it is definitely enough for two average appetites and you don't get bored so easily.   2.  They have a large grocery using the same name 3/4 mile east. The restaurant is a smaller place hidden away in a strip mall."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I can understand why this restaurant is a hit with the ASU crowd: its proximity to campus, accessibility by light rail, low prices. The hummus appetizer alone, a generous serving at less than 3 bucks with hot pita halves, could be a heavy snack or a light meal. The very inexpensive sandwiches vary in quality: I found the falafel to be really good, the koubideh was OK, and the beef shawarma was dry and lacking in flavor. The tabouleh was a bit too acidic for my taste and would probably have been better if more bulgur were added.  Waiting time at dinner depends on the size of your group. When I came with a larger group, we had a long wait, but seating was prompt when I came with just 2 friends. Overall, my dining experiences here were OK. For food quality, I consider the nearby Cafe Istanbul to be a better choice; but for price, this is the place to go."}

In a nutshell, it's a neat little place and our service was very good. Nothing was horrible. Appetizer was quite tasty, but the pita was flimsy and had no taste to it. Entree was OK, but the little bubble gum size, chewy chicken is disgraceful. Not appetizing at all, pushed it all to the side.  Arabic (or Turkish) coffee was good, but done too quickly. It's supposed to slowly rise to the top 3 times before being served. I know, you're busy and it's a pain in the ass, but that's how it's done, and tastes much better when cooked properly. Also should have had more cardamom and sugar, but that's probably just my personal taste."}

The lentils are just ok and the rice serves the same. Something dull about the flavor. Maybe I'm too american for their own good.  The hours of operation at this place are extremely weird.

My husband and I went and we got the two most popular things on their menu plus an iced tea.  The flavors were very nice but I didnt like the use of dark chicken meat.  To me it just doesnt taste as good and there was no choice it just comes that way.  Other things were really dry and not as good as what I am used to when I go out to eat.  The iced tea was nice it was a black tea with cinnamon added so not that special but I guess it is different than the norm which I like.  To me Pita Jungle and My Big Fat Greek are far superior but of course it would depend on what you ordered.  I like spicy and I love tahini.  This place was kinda below average for me and I think its because of the dark meat chicken.  My husband left his whole plate untouched pretty much.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "First off, let me preface this review by saying that I've eaten here a few times in the past and it was mainly a pleasant experience.  I arrived at the restaurant at 11 am on Sunday, the hours clearly written on the door saying that that was the time they opened.  As I waited to be seated, an employee came up to me and said the kitchen would not be opening until 11:30.  No I'm sorry for the inconvenience, no I apologize for the wait, just so matter-of-fact, we don't give a crap about you attitude that I almost walked out right then and there.  But I brushed it off and gave them another chance.  After waiting for the half hour, I see the employee cleaning the tables and placing menus upon them.  He notices a fly on the window, promptly kills the fly with the menu, and proceeds to place the menu back on the table, dead fly and all.  Very sanitary, well done.  I still waited to be seated after witnessing this, unbelievably.  Finally get seated, was obviously the first one in the place, and this same employee proceeds to take some other customers order before me.  That was the last straw, I was out of there.  NOTE TO STAFF AT HAJI BABA:  I am a paying customer, do not ever act like I am doing you a favor by visiting your establishment.  You provide a service and I choose whether or not to give you my business.  Needless to say, I will never be back to your restaurant, and can only hope that you'll start appreciating the already established customer base that you've somehow held onto."}

However, my last experience at this restaurant didn't go well. I wasn't going to post a review about it until that particular incident happen.   I called them at 12:48 for 10 chicken shawarma plates to go. We had a quick conversation and I was told it be ready in ten minutes. I said I'll be there in 15-20 and I was there as I promised. However, I found out that the guy who responded didn't add a zero next to 1 so they made it ready only one. I was totally cool with it cuz, we are human beings and mistaken are so normal. Despite I was in a little bit of rush I was ok with the whole situation. Then the gentlemen told me it will be ready in 2-3 minutes. I said you are fine I'll wait. So after 25 minutes- yes 25 minutes (a duration of numerous customers who are at tables in their restaurant, people who came to buy quick snack or grocery shoppers were served) - 7 of my 10 order was ready to go. They asked me if I'd like to pay after and I said yeah I will... I came to register I'm totally fine despite 45 min passed since my call for the order, and as I was paying the guy literally took some candies (I guess they were turkish delight or some other stuff and start stocking into bags as he was apologizing for the delay. I stopped him there ask not to do and as soon as the other 3 came, I left.   Now,  1) you don't satisfy your frustrated customers with randomly stocked candies  2) If you are sincere about your apology, you go with better solutions than candy( by the way, they candy is always unwrapped I am 100 sure they are all covered with the dust of all the customers walking in-how can you even sell that in the first place is another point 3) If I'd make a big fuss right there instead of writing a review here, probably I'd be the blamed one for making a big drama. Since I was pretty patient with the whole process, you gotta reward that kind customer attitude not with candy.   I am aware I kept forever but last thing, maybe people are enjoying here because they don't find many alternatives to this kind of cuisine and menu but I tell you that, if they would cook, serve the same way back in the hometown of where they are from, They would be one of those average restaurants. So, please whenever you are there; ask for cleanliness and better service and improvement inside the restaurant. Otherwise, if they are not challenged, they will continue to serve average level because of their preferable price/overall ratio."}

Our server definitely seemed like he was trying a little too hard to be friendly.

Yet our waiter would linger for excessive periods of time and make weird, desperate jokes when he did decide to grace our table with his presence. I am probably being overly critical, but I found it a little odd.  I know that the cheese dip and pretzel bites are absolutely to die for--I had them at the Scottsdale location once, but resisted chasing the dragon on this visit. I recommend getting that if you want an appetizer.  Atmosphere is pretty good. The decor is lovely--I love the tables and chairs especially.

From Moulin Rough light fixture to the bright red long 70's style couch & the hipster vibe. Kinda cool and unusual. Menu has many offerings. The most popular appetizer has to be the Pretzel fondue! We weren't huge fans of the bread/ balsamic: pretty basic and the bread was to over done.  Our server was good, friendly personality. With that said, had a lot to deal with & only some support from other staff when presenting the meals.I would have to say it was very slow from start to finish, but I give her tons of credit. The assistance were attentive at refilling waters. The things that took way to long : our bar drinks, requests were forgotten ( like my side of ranch & husbands beer ) our main dishes from the kitchen, our bills were so slow to complete at the end of our dining experience!  I had the fried chicken, it was somewhat of a disappointment. Over cooked & dry. 3 pieces- breast, thigh & drum. The breast wasn't a full size (like 1/2) there was bones throughout. The honey drizzle: couldn't even find or really even taste. The biscuit- no butter slaw average, mashed potatoes creamy. My son & daughter had the Sweet Corn Raviolis. That was  to die for. The BEST most divine pasta we've had in Arizona, thus far! That is a MUST have here! Absolutely Incredible!! My B-day boy had requested the Rainbow Trout, but they'd run out. Bummer, as it was his Birthday choice. He ended up getting the Roasted Salmon, it was good. My husband had the BBQ Pub Burger with an egg & really seemed to enjoy it.

We couldn't carry on a conversation. As a result we have not returned to this restaurant. The prices for the food are really reasonable, and if you aren't a vegetarian than you will probably love the food here. Try going during the day to avoid the loud music."}

This was our first time there and I was amazed at how loud it was inside at 4:30 in the afternoon.  When our waitress finally arrived, I asked for lots of water.  It's damned hot out in the summer!  I explained to her that I would like LOTS of water.   Fast forward to the food... it was average.  We had the pretzel bites for an appetizer. Not horrible, but not spectacular.  He ordered the fried chicken, and I had the fish and chips.  His complaint was the chicken was over cooked and too crispy for him.  I thought it was cooked fine, but really lacked flavor.  The fish though, that was pretty tasty.  It was a lot of food.  Too bad I spent most of my meal with an empty glass that should have had water in it.  LOTS of water. I had to ask the hostess for a refill as well as the food runner.  My waitress was very visible on the floor, but could not seem to be bothered by checking in on such a lowly two-top.  Will we go back? Probably not.  This place did not rank on my list of must have again. And thanks for the migraine due to dehydration... That makes the visit even better!"}

Then the waitress shows up, we literally JUST sat down-super rad promptness, but maybe give guests a moment to look at the menu? Then I ordered a drink, after she returned, she asked to see my ID (I left my purse at home). So we found a copy of my Drivers License in our email from recently sending to a realtor. Mind you; I'm 39 years old, with an 18 year old daughter. She asked her manager and he said that he couldn't accept seeing the license and couldn't serve me a drink. I get rules, I do, but I'm obviously over 21.. So! We left. If I'm being honest, I wasn't that impressed with the menu anyways and the anti pasta menu is cool, but the pricing is a bit much AND I never mind paying for good food.   Needless to say; we won't return. I'm bitter about the carding situation and I sincerely feel the customer service is lacking in experience. This is a disappointment, since we're new to the area and we live and work close to this location."}

Made reservations then get there and told wait would be about 15 minutes (I hate when that happens, why make reservations then) We decided we'd just sit outside so that we could be seated right away. We get seated and ordered our food when we order drinks. While waiting for our food, I saw three times where food was brought out to the wrong table and I'm thinking how is that happening. After 42 minutes, our food finally arrived (we only ordered the kids mac n cheese, fish and chips and the roasted salmon). My husband's salmon was not cooked completely. After flagging down 1 of our 2 servers, she told us yeah, it's normally medium. Let me get that fixed and took my husband's plate. The second server had come by the table a few times, only to chat with my 2.5 year old (yeah, odd). So after we sent the salmon back, she comes by again to talk to my son, never asking how things are or even noticing my husband didn't have his food. I interrupted her conversation with my little guy to let her know things were ok but my husband wasn't happy with his salmon. She goes oh, well they normally only cook it medium rare. So I ask well why did the other lady say it's medium? This chick just smiled at me and then started back talking to my son. The chef ends up bringing the salmon back out and apologized and it was to my husband's liking. While we were eating, another guy comes over to us with someone else's order asking if it was ours....i just shook my head and laughed. The service was ok. The place nice and trendy, reminded me of some east coast places i loved. Probably should've sat inside, outside was sooo noisy (but, i wasn't ok waiting when I'd already made reservations) This place is probably somewhere I'd come with girlfriends for happy hour or to have drinks and appetizers before going out but not family dinner again. The first server seemed busy and the second server..... This place is huge and I feel like with it being that big, the kitchen should be able to accommodate large crowds. There's no reason our food should have taken so long (and neither server came by with updates about the wait or to let us know it would be out soon) and I'm still trying to figure out why they kept taking food to wrong tables.

There were 4 adults in our party and we were celebrating our adult daughters' birthday. First of all, the restaurant is hard to find - many one way streets and construction. When you enter you go down a long hall to the actual restaurant. The restaurant itself is similar to a large convention hall with poor acoustics. It was very, very loud - making it difficult, at times impossible, to have a normal conversation. Our server was really lacking in just about every trait a server should have, including the 4 rings in her exposed belly button - not very appetizing. From the moment we arrived we felt very rushed by her. Our meals were pretty good. I had the sweet corn cannelloni, which was an unusual dish and very sweet, my husband had the Italian Grinder - something he always orders at CD, our son had the fried chicken which he said was very good and our daughter had the grilled cheese sliders, which she thought were OK. We had ordered a bowl of the daily house made chips, which were stale. Despite our opening gifts, cards, etc., the server never acknowledged our celebration.   Quite frankly, I am sorry we chose this restaurant for our daughter's birthday. It was a disappointing evening. I expect more from a Fox Concepts restaurant."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "First, let me say, I am so happy to have Culinary Dropout open in Tempe in the Farmer Arts District. I think it is going to be an  anchor establishment for lots of other development in this area and talk about a well run establishment, wow, one can almost hear the hum of operational efficiency in how this place is run and it is a big space and so popular! I took my work-team to lunch here today and honestly, no detail is overlooked and I have no doubt that in going here folks will have a consistently positive experience.  As for why it is only marked as A-Ok right now - well, my first time at this location and as with the other culinary dropout I find the food to be good but nothing, at least this time, sent me into foodie heaven. I got the fried chicken and while it was good, a bit sweet for me for some reason. Part of the reason may be that I had the Asian fusion style fried chicken from Welcome Chicken + Donuts the day before and it suffered a bit by comparison. Probably the big thing, the mashed potatoes come across as a bit too smooth - something like mashed new potatoes, done a bit thicker, would be a bit more in alignment with the sort of stomach grabbing mashed potatoes that complement fried chicken - same for the gravy, feels as bit too smoothed out versus say, a thicker gravy with a stronger component of black pepper.   I will say that the sweet potato cannelloni one of fellow diners had was well received and someone else had the M.A.C. burger and said it was one of her top five burgers. Accordingly, I bet most folks will find the food good enough. If one is a bit more of a foodie I would look to the antipasti menu where one can pick a variety of cured meets, cheeses (including pimento cheese - yum!) and other snacks - I saw some boards of those going out and they looked delicious.   Oh, the music was at a low (good volume) when my group sat down for lunch at 11:15 and then as things started to get packed, they cranked up the volume - I have a feeling that is meant to help keep things moving quickly or even more likely, I'm becoming a grouchy old guy but keeping music at a reasonable level so that it adds to the ambiance but does not overwhelm or overshadow the level of conversation seems important.   Key point here, a Yelp review is deeply personal and to some degree we have to throw in a level of it connected with me as a diner so that is why it is a  three star - I don't hate it but I also don't go - wow, that was an uncommonly good eating experience - I'll make sure to go back a few times and see if things change as I try more things on the menu, including some of the house cocktails - at the end of the day I'm extremely happy to have this establishment in my neighborhood.  P.S. - one thing that was amazing, the apple monkey bread with ice cream dessert -  that was amazing and worth getting again. :-)"}

He was supposed to help our large party, pretty much accused me of lying and never came back to our table. We could have spent hundreds of dollars there but we were so mad we left. We will never be back. First time experience was horrible."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "A happy day was soured by a condescending manager, Jason Brown, at the Culinary Dropout. Our event at the Culinary Dropout was coordinated with Alexia Haley, the Event Manager, to celebrate my son's High School graduation.  My initial interest was to have it as a dinner function but was told that the yard area (ping pong, bag toss, etc.) will be for those 21 and older after 6 pm.  So we decided to have the event at 1 pm.  We booked two locations - two lounge seating areas for the high school graduates and a table of 14 in the restaurant for adults.  Shortly after the guests arrived, my son told me that they were not allowed in the ping pong area unless they were accompanied by someone at least 21 years old. I was surprised at his comment but thought the person didn't know that they were 18 year olds and also to relay that the event manager was fine with the 18 year olds and ping pong as long as we were out of the place by 6pm. As soon as I got to the gaming area I was met by an angry man who started yelling at me that the kids can't be in the area unless they were accompanied by a 21-year-old and that he will lose his liquor license.  I proceeded to explain to him that this event had been arranged through Alexia and I was never told to have a 21-year-old present at the ping pong table.  He started yelling that he had told Alexia to inform me of the 21-year-old escort rule. And that my teens had to leave if a 21-year-old wasn't present by the table right now.  To not disrupt the kids' game, I stayed at the gaming area for a bit but was concerned with the arriving guests. A parent, Anthony, who was watching his younger kids, volunteered to watch my 18 year olds for 5 minutes so I can return to my table to sort out the problem.  I didn't want to create a commotion as I had approximately 30 teenagers arriving and adults at the main dining area. As a courtesy, I informed Jason Brown that I needed five minutes and that the gentlemen (Anthony) standing by the gaming tables will be watching my teens so I can sort out this escort problem.  He spat out He cannot watch your kids - Anthony doesn't belong to your party.  I replied, You told me an adult or a 21-year-old needs to be present and right now he is helping me so I can return to my table to sort out this problem.  He shouted you are not taking 5 minutes, if you are not back in 2 minutes, your kids will not be playing.  I later found out he was the District Manager of Culinary Dropout. I am appalled at his condescending conversation towards me. Not only did he not try to help rectify a situation that was a communication problem from his event management staff, but he spoke like a bully. I felt belittled and humiliated. My only conclusion is either he had a bad day or he dislikes Asians. In the service industry, service is key regardless of who you serve.  As a manager, he should try to not make matters worse or intimidate.  He had two other staff standing alongside him guarding the gaming area and as the restaurant wasn't full, he could have helped me if he wanted to. After I sorted my guests and created a rotating shift at the ping pong table, one of my friends asked to speak to the manager. Much to my surprise, Jason Brown showed up.  I don't know what the nature of their discussion was but at the end, he gifted two of the wines we ordered - a gesture we very much appreciated.  All the staff at Culinary Dropout were courteous and Alexia Haley was a joy to work with. All the guests were happy at the end of the day but Jason's conversation with me at the gaming area makes me want to speak up for all the minorities that gets picked on based on a preconceived notion of a particular minority feature...  this is especially important for managers or District Managers. Tempe is a diverse college city with lots of Internationals and I hope everyone gets the respect they deserve as a citizen of the world no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. Would have been 4 stars if not for the intimidating encounter with Jason Brown.  I frequent this place and have recommended it to many friends.  So sad."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Came here after work for dinner with some friends.  I've been meaning to check out this place for quite some time because of all of it's raving reviews.  First and foremost, parking.  There's tons of parking space which is great! However, this place is seriously popular, especially after work around 5PM. Despite the relatively large parking space, almost all of the spots were taken -- my roommate and I got lucky and pulled in as someone was pulling out. I will note that there is complimentary valet though (bring cash, just in cash! Don't forget to tip!)  Now onto the interior. Gorgeous, gorgeous place. From the floors, to the walls, to the women's bathroom, to the relaxed (or absence of?)dress code for the staff... this place is so trendy and hip! I'm especially fond of the lights (they dim then around 6pm!). I'd definitely love to get a little dressed up and go here to grab some drinks with my friends. This is the perfect place for that.  The staff? The staff was great! Super accommodating and responsive. Constantly checking in on how our group was doing. Loved it.  Now for the appetizers. We had two appetizers: the pretzel and provolone fondue as well as the pork rib nachos. Both were fantastic and very easy to share. So much flavor and cheese! I love cheese. I'd love to try all of the other apps (I'm thinking the wings next time!)  As for the entrees, I ordered the Italian grinder with a cheap house salad on the side. The salad was awesome! It's presentation definitely did not match up with its name. Now, the Italian grinder looked quite delicious (I asked for lots of jalapeños in it!) but man.. it just wasn't good. I was pretty full from the apps so this may have contributed to it, but geez, I really couldn't bring myself to finish the sandwich. So I asked for a to-go box and decided to save it for tomorrow's lunch.  When I got home, I had a HORRIBLE stomach ache (I'll spare you the details). I told all my friends thinking that maybe the appetizers were the cause. Everyone else was fine, except for me. Perhaps I had something else to eat earlier on in the day that upset my stomach? So I gave the sandwich another shot.  NOPE NOPE NOPE. Eating the remainder of my sandwich ended up with the same results. I learned my lesson. I am never, ever going near the Italian grinder again.   I didn't have the most positive first experience here... I will definitely go back to this place for some drinks and apps and MAYBE some of the other entrees but in all honesty, none of them really caught my eye -- which is how I ended up with the sandwich.  At the end of the day, this is the perfect place for some apps and drinks, but I don't think I'd ever come here for dinner. But who knows? Maybe next time I'll change my mind and work up the courage to give some of the other entrees a shot. Maybe I'll check out the location in Scottsdale or Phoenix. Until then, my stomach and I will definitely be avoiding the dining area at this location for the foreseeable future. If I ever go back, you can find me at the bar."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "This decision isn't one that I'm happy about. As a first time patron at the Culinary Dropout, I have to say, I will not be returning not because of the food (by the way, the food was OUTSTANDING) but because of the our waitress. On a Friday night, one could expect to have a delay in being seated, having orders taken...but to wait 45 minutes for your drink to arrive after already waiting 15 minutes for your waitress to acknowledge our table, is ridiculous! On top of waiting, a lady in our group asked for her drink three times, in which the waitress walked away twice while the request was being made....I mean who does that? Oh and by the way, never ONCE was I offered a refill on my Diet Coke during the 2+ hours of being there.   Now on to the food, as stated above, the food is outstanding, however, due to our waitress not bringing our food out in a timely manner, my steak was cold. By this time, I had enough of the service issues and just wanted OUT.   The check arrives, and lone behold, it's wrong...waitress fixes the check, and proceeds to cash us out...our total bill for two is a little over $60, I hand the waitress a $100, and should have received $41.36 back in change....guess what, the waitress returns $41 and no change. So needless to say, your waitress should be thankful she kept the $.36 in change because that's $.35 more than what she was going to get from me.   I honestly hope the Culinary Dropout reviews this and either contacts me for more information  before this waitress is allowed to ruin what could be an amazing experience for others."}

I called a week and half in advance and they told me they couldn't reserve the spot that I wanted for my party but I could come at 5 and wait around until 7 so I could save the spot. I declined. I had my boyfriend call back the next day to see if we could reserve a table or tables in the patio area for 12 people. They said yes they could do that. Today the manager called my boyfriend back and told him that they couldn't reserve a table for a large party after 6pm (party at 7). They told him if we wanted a table at 7 we would have to come as 'walk-ins' and take a table that was available (if there was any available for that many people)  Overall I felt very discouraged and unwelcome. What Resturant doesn't take reservations for large parties? Wouldn't a Resturant want to have large guaranteed party to come in to spend money at their place?  I highly doubt I will go back anytime soon which sucks because that place is pretty cool but their policies and staff are not!"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I really only write experiences when I encounter a problem or am blown away by a restaurant. This one happens to be the former. I've always enjoyed myself here: great beer selection, fun games, decent food. However, last night I met up with some friends to celebrate a birthday. I had called ahead to make sure it was OK to bring a small liquor bottle (completely sealed, unopened) as a present for him, and was told it wouldn't be a problem. I've also seen this happen quite a few times before with bigger bottles and bottles of wine from other guests while I've been here before. While we were playing games, security called me over, and told me I need to leave. Security said they could hold it at the host stand with my driver's license to pick up at the end of the night, so I accepted, but was met by one of the hosts/managers a minute later telling me I need to leave.  I tried to explain myself, saying I was told it was OK, but the manager/hostess didn't seem to care. Apparently, she had seen me drinking from the bottle and that was not OK. I asked security to open the bag and check if the bottle was open. When he twisted the cap, you could hear the seal breaking, which suggested the bottle was unopened until that point. I suggested that I take the bag and go put it in my car so I don't cause any more problems, but they told me I need to go and they were confiscating the bottle. I, once again, explained it was for a birthday present and that the bottle was unopened, but at this point no one was listening, so I told them I was taking my bottle and putting it in my car and would come back.  After this incident, I figured the rest of the night would go smoothly, but while playing cornhole, two gentlemen on a double date were yelling at us for getting in their space. However, they were the ones moving their cornhole boards within a foot of ours, telling us to get the f*** out of the way, while barely able to control their motor functions because they were so drunk. We asked them to move and were met with more f-bombs and threats to fight us. We asked a busser to grab security to check on the situation, but security gave us a look, a wave, and didn't do anything else, while one of the dudes was stumbling so bad he couldn't walk without tripping over himself and spilling his beer everywhere, including on himself and everyone's shoes within a five foot radius.  Don't let my experience scare you away, this place is still great and I'll be back, but just think twice before you bring any birthday presents or play cornhole next to any drunk douchebags."}

We told the server that we would appreciate light on the simple syrup because we don't care for sweet cocktails.  We want to taste the whiskey.  They were still too sweet.  Asked again and brought us manhattans instead old fashioned's.  Tried to tell us that they were the correct drink. He was maybe young 20's and barely knew what each drink was made with.  Trust me we were given the wrong drinks.  The trout was disgusting and excessively salty.  Told the server and figured he would get a manger or take it off the bill.  Guess what, neither happened.

I'll get to the food part in a minute but there were a few things previous to that, that bothered me.   We got there after 6pm on Thursday so of course, it was busy. About a 40 minute wait so we went into the lounge area to find somewhere to sit hopefully. The only lounge no one was sitting at had a sign that said Heather 5:30. Because it was well after 6, I asked 3 employees before one finally grabbed a manager if we could sit there based on the time. The so called manager wandering around with the tablet in her hand that never even looked at the area I was asking about finally told me to give it another 45 minutes. I told her to disregard because we should be seated by then but what really made no sense was if an establishment is this busy, why would you hold a lounge for someone that's already 40 minutes late??  Next, while we were at a table by the bar some nice people shared with us, my son ordered an appetizer. Shortly after that we were notified our table was ready and he told our temporary server which in turn told him she would have it sent over. We then found out from our new server that she never placed the order.  I had the fried chicken and before I ordered it, I was told there was a $4 up charge for either all white or all dark meat which made no sense to me, but regardless it was 4 pieces. I decided just to have it as it came. Turned out it was 3 pieces and I couldn't tell for sure if it was burnt or supposed to be the dark color it was. It was a leg, thigh, and what seemed like half of a breast that was an odd long shape. Also, the biscuit that came with it was cold which I thought to be odd. My meal was the only one in question as everyone else was happy with theirs.  The last thing I'll mention is that all of us noticed that you can't really tell who works there. A couple tables over there was a gentleman wearing a denim jacket over a t shirt with matching jeans that looked like he was one of the party he was with but he was grabbing drinks from the bar and pouring the guests water. When you could tell someone was an employee because they were doing employee things, you would never be able to differentiate them from a customer because of how they were dressed. I've just never seen that anywhere else.  I've never worked at a restaurant before but I have been a manager and I think that if some of these mangers were better trained  or had a better idea of what they were doing, there wouldn't be so many confused or frustrated customers. And don't get me wrong, working there can't be easy with how busy it is but just some of the things I noticed could be changed for the better.  I don't like writing anything negative but these were things that stood out. It is a cool place but I just think it could be better if some of the issues were looked at."}

Last, once we finally saw an empty/ not used board for bags, I went and checked one set of bags out. I even had all of our bags set up and ready to play  when my friend got back from getting us more drinks...and they had checked another set of bags out to someone right after me and they tried to play 'teams' with the four of us...that made us pretty aggravated because WHY in the HELL would you check out more bags than you have boards to play on. Makes NO Sense.   Overall, I used to recommend this place to people asking about something fun to do in Tempe but I don't think I can do that anymore."}

I either love a restaurant or hate it and usually it's for a very Seinfeld-esque reason. The name is wrong. The font on the menu is pedestrian. The website is horrible. *none of which apply to CDO, btw.    I'm kind of mad that CDO took over for the Sail Inn so for sentimental reasons alone; I don't like CDO. However, I was blown away by customer service and attentiveness of the servers that were assigned to my group for our work event. We were well taken care of and the tokens to use for drinks were way better than ticket methods. Having ping pong, corn hole and stage nearby make for the most fun atmosphere.  Food is typical bar food and nothing I MUST HAVE and need to go back for. Restaurant week is coming up and I don't feel like I'm missing anything if I don't visit Culinary Dropout.   For atmosphere, drinks and food; this is a great spot. I could also see myself coming here on a date or suggest it as a first date spot."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Came here with a large group of co workers on Friday evening. I had very mixed feelings about this place. The pros were definitely the large space (great for events!), easy convenient free parking, tasty drinks, and nice outdoor concept area with games and couches. The cons were the heat and humidity that made sitting in the outdoor area uncomfortable (everyone was soaked in sweat), overpriced food and drinks, and surly staff. My co worker had a dog and was rudely informed by 6 different staff members that dogs weren't allowed. I get it, but you can be a little nicer about it. Not necessary for 6 people to give her a hard time. She ended up leaving immediately because she couldn't stay with the dog. The drinks were very expensive- $10 to $12 for their underwhelming and small cocktails. Tasty but expensive. I had some sangria and it was $8 a glass and delicious but weak. Also very small especially considering how much ice was in the cup. The service was surly and there was a lot of pressure to keep ordering more and more. It was clear that they do not want you to hang out on the couches unless you are quickly and consistently spending lots of money. Again I get it but you can make it a little less known. I would definitely come back but I would manage your expectations with this place. Know what you're getting into. This is not your friendly neighborhood bar."}

We were quite a large group and were seated out in The Yard - a large covered patio space filled with cosy couches, tons of super hot fire pits, and games. Sadly I didn't get to try the games this time around but hopefully I will next time - I feel like that could have been a highlight!  We sat at a fire pit with a large L-shaped couch on one side, and several adorably mismatched chairs surrounding the other two sides. The fire pit was HOT, seriously hot! Open flame and booze seems like a risky combination to me, but who doesn't love a good backyard fire pit??   It was a little tricky eating our meals off the side of the fire pit, and there was more than one occasion that had me concerned I was going to a. set something on fire, or b. have a melted beer glass from the sheer heat of the flames!  My beer was quite tasty - a good local brew. We shared some tasty devilled eggs, some ok potato chips (a little greasy and under-flavoured for me), and some well done hummus (you can't go wrong with hummus!). For my main I had the grilled cheese sliders; I'm not sure what I was expecting but the flavour wasn't quite there. The three little sandwiches were super cute and filled with well melted cheese slices, bacon and tomato - great for when you're looking for good throwback food to your childhood!  I'm looking forward to my next trip here - I think it has huge potential and I had fun, I just think I could have a lot more fun next time! :)"}

I am not a jealous guy haha but you need to read your guests to know if they are comfortable with that. We ordered and I asked that my French fries be substituted by a salad, he said sure but I still got French fries and no salad. My ribs were dried and not really what I thought.

The rest of the food, meat loaf, fried chicken and fish and chips were just average. The restaurant itself is to dark and gloomy, we were seated directly in front of the kitchen so it was to noisy to have a conversation and the banquet we were seated at needs to be replaced as it is worn out. Why do restaurant owners think that their guest want to hear all the noise from the kitchen? I go out to eat with friends to visit with them, something you can't do here with out yelling across the table."}

First off; the make up air system for the exhaust grease hoods is waaayyy off, when you enter the building you experience the wiff of a back alley Japanese teppanyaki grease fryer-smoke sensation, I had to drop off my clothes at the dry cleaners the next morning to rid this odor. If your not familiar with make up air its the air that is pumped in from the roof to provide the exhaust grease hood to make up for the air its exhausting, sometimes too close to an HVAC unit on the roof it gets pumped in for the patrons to breathe and smell. Second; the layout feels like a junior high school cafeteria with tables lined up in parallel, with all the cool kids having fun tossing bags of beans back and forth in the adjoining Yard. Third; our server was pleasant, speedy, but lacked a smile, maybe had a bad day who knows? Fourth; we ordered the 36 hour pork ribs, mistake, they were cold, apx. room temperature or just below, I felt like a cave man chewing the hard to separate meat off the bone, after which we asked where the restrooms were so we could wash our hands from all of the bbq sauce, our server pointed the way down a dreary hallway, why don't they provide a wet nap at minimum, for the $25 plate they should provide a hot towel!   Culinary Dropout is a great matching name for the restaurant, I think every one staffed there may just be Drop Outs..."}

However I am so over coming here because they keep overcharging the amount I was supposed to pay, AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE.  Yes, the servers are all very engaging friendly and draw you in so much so, however they lack attention to detail when making the transactions for the payment...   The first time they messed up my payment  they charged me twice over the amount I was supposed to pay, and only purchased a beer. I reported it and they did admit that they charged me over which I understood since they were really busy that night and may have swiped my card for the wrong order. Eventually they did credit the amount. It was fine the first time, and I had let it go,   My recent experience three days ago went well so I thought, I ordered the dinner for 2 because of the restaurant week deal that was going on. My server Franky/Franklin was super friendly convinced me that it was a good deal since I were to get an appetizer, 2 main courses, a desert split amongst 2 people for $44. The bill came out to $70 with my friend also getting a few cocktails, so we split it and with tip my receipt is about $40.   Next day my card was charged for $66, and mind you I am a poor college student amongst many others l and was shocked on why on I was charged over the amount. I called about it to dispute it and the person on the phone lacked no empathy whatsoever, no apology, nothing sincere just said oh well it looks like we actually don't have your card in the system. She wrote down all my information said she would pass it along the manager, and that they would call me by the end of the night.   Manager called me pretty late in the night apologizing which I appreciated but still couldn't find the transaction of my card on file. I explained to her that that I understood that people make mistakes however the night was slow, there should have been no mistake on swiping the right card for the right amount...   So bottom line: Ensure that the servers know when to stop being too friendly and talkative because they can eventually get so distracted in the conversations, that they might forget which card is whose and charge you the wrong amount. AND I emphasize they have to pay attention to detail. Also try to have a sense of empathy when I am trying to explain nicely that what you guys did was wrong and admit your mistake.   So yes is the food good to die for, is this a place where you want to show off your ping pong skills to the cutie across the room, and enjoy the hipster ambience of other college kids? Yes.   But if you're a struggling person in college  who can't always afford treating yourself like me, where $20 is life or death sometimes in your bank account, beware because who knows they may try to rip you off and charge more than what you owe."}

The sauce did have good flavor but not enough to make up for the poor prep of the ribs. The sides were also nothing special.  My son had the pork belly nachos.  The pork was just regular old shredded pork and the cheese sauce was just that... a sauce.  Possibly Velveeta.  Pork belly when cooked well can be quite tasty but shredded pork is not pork belly.

However, our waiter was VERY nice and accommodating when we asked if we could order something else instead. We got the fish & chips which came out pronto. They weren't bad, maybe a 3/5.  Overall our waiters and the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful. This place was not horrible by any means, but I don't think we'll be returning."}

We were there for 3+  hours because our waiter would disappear for long periods of time. He forgot our pretzels and then gave us the wrong dessert to go. He simply wasn't listening or even looking at us when we were ordering which I think is the reason why we had so many mistakes with our orders.  I'm just going to stick with the Scottsdale location from now on. They have great service and food!"}

The manager refused to take it off the tab and never even visited our table.The waiter told me it was because he checked on me and I said it was fine. I and everyone around me disagreed with him  and told him that I did not touch my food and waited for him to come back. He acted surprised and thought he had. I told him it was fine, but I would not be back and I was disappointed because I had heard so many positive reviews.  I did not tip him well since my understanding was the reason the manager would not remove the food from my bill was because he had said I told him it was fine. I told him I would be posting this on yelp. If you go to Tempe, pick a place who values their customers."}

The girl who was the runner tonight couldn't even find me when she brought out my soup. I needed people around me to call her back to give me my soup. Oh and they never brought me my entree.

I had the fried chicken, it was 3 bone in pieces, white and dark meat. It came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes and coleslaw. It was decent. My husband had the meatloaf with green beans and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf was average, he's not into ketchup smeared on top, and then they put the green beans in the ketchup in top of the meatloaf.  For dessert they brought banana cream pie, and a s'mores pot de creme type thing. The s'mores was pretty tasty!

The hostess was going to sit us right away but we then asked if we can try to sit outside. She said it was first come first serve. We thought we could try it outside since the misters were on. Once we got out there and sat down for 2 mins (we didn't even have time to order a drink), we decided it was way too hot. We went back inside and the hostess told us in a very unpleasant manner that it now would be a 25-30 minute wait for a table (even though the place was empty and there were clearly various 6 top tables available). We didn't want to wait 25 - 30 mins so we decided to go back outside and literally sweat it out.  Waiter was very friendly and attentive - he was the best thing about the night.  We got our drinks and order our apps - wings without nuts since one our friends had a peanut allergy. Guess what we got? Wings with nuts sprinkled all over. They got sent back and new wings came out. We then ordered our food. One of the plates was the grill cheese sliders - we asked to have it without bacon and tomatoes. Guess what we got? Grill cheese with bacon and tomatoes. That also got sent back and the kitchen argued that the order was right. The waiter had to prove himself with the meal ticket. Meanwhile we are still sweating in the 100 degree outdoor patio and the 6 top tables inside are still empty - actually no one ever sat in them at all! When I finally complained to the Manager she apologized and took 35% off the bill. I honesty think at this point the dinner should have been comped. We should have had to pay for the drinks but the food should have been taken off the bill.  I was looking forward to experiencing this place since I heard so many good things about it and it was a huge disappointment!

It's got a solid selection and range though and our servers were pretty prompt. I get where they're going with the fire pits but I think the execution leaves something to be desired.   First, glass near fire seems problematic. Also, the fire pits are like really on fire. So you can't reach across the area to share and it becomes this odd game of pass the plate. Our water glasses were hot to the touch and you can imagine what that meant for anyone with a wine or a cocktail. Their menus are paper... and as it turns out, paper can catch on fire. Ours did not but I see the potential for serious hazard. Not sure how you remedy this architectural snafu but maybe turning the blazing pits down would be a good first start.

He was more interested with his buddies at the bar and he was serving me. Server: PM BAR EAST 9:19PM.

You apologize to your unseated party for YOUR error, seat and accommodate them immediately. I am wondering what Alyssa expected us to do with our drinks and appetizers as we stood there dumbfounded shuffling about, while they cleared our table, commenting under their breath, to replace us with the unseated party. I must mention that my group was made up of entirely black colleagues and the party we were unseated for was white.

Poorly arranged (as opposed to separate small tapas-style plates). And that cheese chunk (with no bread) was laying right there along with all the rest: ODD.

Again with this much real estate it's near impossible to trump the atmosphere at Culinary Dropout, and the responsive staff keep up with what can be some serious lunch time volumes. Our party of five was tended to wonderfully and the food came out quick once ordered even during a mobbed Friday lunch hour. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  $13.00 for a medium to large sized sandwich is a bit steep in Tempe, but it wasn't unreasonable given what were some solid ingredients and a generous portion of fries. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  I had sky high expectations for my Turkey Pastrami sandwich, I mean, they went so far as to star is on the menu! Maybe it was these expectations that robbed the sandwich of a home run, but I simply didn't think that this was a dish that I couldn't pretty easily replicate after a quick visit to the grocery store.  I was expecting fresh juicy house made turkey pastrami, but whether or not that was the case, it came across as just the standard Boar's Head Cracked Pepper Turkey that you can find anywhere. From there, the pretzel bun didn't impress as much as I thought it would, the the slaw was standard. A good sandwich no doubt, but not a gamechanger in my view. Single Star.

The corn tortillas were brittle and dry and like the chicken lukewarm. I've had a lot of people tell me the food is great here but that wasn't our experience this time. As it is I could not recommend this place. Very trendy, kinda pricey and food wasn't great."}

At 5:45 they told us any remaining guests had to hurry because there was another reservation at our table at 7. Very rude because what restaurant tells their paying guests to hurry up. Then, they sent another server over to remind us again 15 minutes later. Knowing very well they wouldn't kick us out of our seats, and we weren't done hanging out, we took our time and stayed. Around 7:30 a hostess came back to tell us that the party who reserved our table had arrived and we needed to leave. SO RUDE.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "This Fox location has provided me with more disappointing experiences than I can count. I've had 6 or 7 visits here, and I've had service missteps every step of the way. I've gotten my appetizers after my entrees multiple times, the servers I've had are poorly versed in their menu and bar capabilities (not to mention often highly unusual and hard to notice since they're encouraged to dress like they would outside of work), and had overall unpleasant experiences. It's painfully obvious that they value aesthetics much more than service; there's no way I can get behind a restaurant like that.   I'm not a Fox restaurant hater - I've worked at one, been to many, enjoyed myself most of the time... But the way they treat their employees and their guests (at this location in particular) leaves a lot to be desired. This doesn't include the fact that Fox cheaply and lamely copies dishes over from other menus, making it almost impossible to have a unique and new experience by visiting other restaurants within the concept group. Culinary Dropout in Tempe has given me no reason to return."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Culinary Dropout used to be my favorite go-to destination in Tempe. I'm not saying the food is that great, it was more because of the personable and accommodating bar staff, great ambience, diversity of clientele, and live music on Friday and Saturday nights. However, on a recent visit, my husband and I experienced a rather unusual and disturbing encounter with Jason the General Manager that I won't soon forget. Call it corporate political-correctness run amok, but the way Jason tried to represent his other patrons at the expense of alienating two of his best was inexcusable. Jason was not rude, but let's just say he was a bit...snarky? smug? condescending? Jason came up to us from behind the bar and interrupted our conversation to explain that we were this night, or in the past, a bit too brash. I don't remember his exact words, but this was the gist. This is a bar, after all, and I thought it was typical for people to have loud and lively debates, but I digress. As I challenged him because he clearly did not have his facts straight, he refused to be specific, only saying that other people concurred. Humbly, I admit that my husband and I can get a little heated in our conversations, WITH EACH OTHER, and if Jason could have identified what either of us said that was rude or offensive, perhaps I would understand. During this berating session, I just looked at him completely bewildered because we had been there less than 30 minutes. Whatever his goal, Jason handled the situation very poorly. Would it not have been better for us to talk directly to the people we offended, if indeed we offended them?  Incidentally, since it's opening, we were in the habit of spending over $300 a week at this Fox restaurant alone. We have chosen to spend that money elsewhere."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "So....ordered some food to pick up today for lunch. Ordered the Pub Burger, a Gorgonzola Chicken Salad and the Caramel Corn to split with a co-worker. Food was great. My issue is with....value. Here are my thoughts when looking at our lunch items individually.   Pub Burger: It is a simple, well constructed burger with a great flavor profile. Thick cut bacon, havarti cheese and barbeque sauce. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium. It was on a pretzel roll which really complimented it well.  At $12 including fries...a solid A for me.   Gorgonzola Chicken Salad:  Chicken, Gorgonzola, butter lettuce, radicchio, arugula, fennel, smoked almond, and tart cherries. So here's the deal....the salad was delicious. But....if Gorgonzola is the first word in the name of the salad, I expect to see more than three dime sized pieces of Gorgonzola in it. Didn't see any smoked almonds either. And at $13 for a salad...I think that I should.  Value? No more than a C.  Maybe ordering a salad to go isn't such a great idea.  House Popped Caramel Corn: I LOVE caramel corn! But, at $4 for two cups I expect more. More corn. Taking the time to cover the corn with caramel more evenly. And how about making some effort to remove the unpopped kernels before you put the caramel on? We had 6 or more unpopped kernels in our two cup order. That is just lazy. Value? D-  So I will definitely try this place again....but I will order a burger and lower my expectations."}

The first time was almost a year ago and we had a similar experience but not so important that I felt the need to say anything.  After all it get's great reviews and mine may not really make a difference.  The similarities in the two visits were that it took a long time to get our food.  Today it was almost an hour. We started to ask the waiters assistant at about 40 mins how much longer it would be. Then the waiter came over and apologized as the kitchen was backed up.  Later, the manager came over to apologize but made no attempt to make any amends.  Then we got the food which was delivered cool to lukewarm in temperature (which made some feel it had been waiting awhile before it was delivered)  Again, talked to the waiter who then I assume made some appeal to the manager on our behalf, but I don't know for sure.  He did offer us a complementary desert but we declined. I don't anticipate going back again.

We made an online reservation for a small birthday dinner for two for 7:15, but were surprised to learn they had no tables upon arrival. We ended up waiting until 7:42. What's the point of a restaurant accepting reservations but then forcing you to wait along with all the walk-ins in an un-air conditioned lobby with the doors wide open? And for a party of two, no less. Upon being seated by the hostess, a gentleman came over to introduce himself and explain that he wasn't our waiter, but another one would be along shortly. Ok. Strange. New waiter takes our appetizer and drink order, then disappears for 20 minutes. Half our appetizers come out fairly quickly (by a different server), but our drinks are no where to be found. Finally get second appetizer, but again not from our original waiter. Wonder again where our drinks are. Finally flag down our waiter and he says he'll check on the drinks. It's now 8:15. 33 mins after being seated, and an hour after our initial reservation and we still haven't been served drinks. Ridiculous. Waiter returns and apologizes for not putting in our drink order. Awesome. We're now done with our appetizers and finally get drinks, except my beer is wrong size, and wife's cocktail doesn't have a straw which makes it nearly impossible to drink. But whatever. Don't wanna nitpick. We let it go figuring it'd take another 20 minutes to fix. Later we ordered entrees and another round of drinks at same time and they were much faster. Food was good. Second round of drinks were strong, so that's a plus. Band playing was a touch too loud, and made it difficult to converse, although they did take breaks. All in all I wasn't terribly impressed with the experience. Their server/waiter system seemed far too chaotic to be efficient during peak hours. They seemed understaffed for a Saturday night. We'd go again, but next time I'd sit at bar to ensure we get drink service."}

Our server took our order and managed to disappear for TWENTY (20) MINUTES. I understand that sometimes, there are switch in shifts or they go on breaks, but nobody came to relieve her. Our waters came out right away, but she never came back to take our drink orders (even though we asked her to come back in a min since we were still deciding). Once our food arrived, the waiters that delivered our food did not say a word and just put our plates down and walked away. There were no utensils, so we tried getting another server's attention so we can actually eat our food and order the drinks we've been waiting on... but everyone we tried to wave over just looked past us. Not impressive at all. My friends and I were so done at this point and just wanted to walk out, but we stayed because we were hungry and have waited 30 mins already by this point. Our server finally came back unapologetically and by this time, our orders were already cold. She took our drink orders and finally got my friend's coke (which she ordered 25 mins before). We ordered the fried chicken & fish and chips. The tartar sauce was bland, and the fried chicken, while a bit flavorful, had the wrong sides (we asked to switch out the coleslaw).

After walking in through a seemingly endless hallway (with an admittedly nice view into the kitchen), I arrived in the main area of Culinary Dropout. I immediately liked the setting, from the openness of all of it to the modern tables. I don't think the smaller tables with the pub-style seating looked very comfortable, so I'm glad I didn't sit there. I was with a large group, and despite that, the service was always quick and attentive.  We had a few appetizers to start. The BBQ pork belly nachos were delicious--guacamole, black beans, some tender and saucy chicken, and a few other toppings were all on there. The soft pretzels and provolone fondue were pretty tasty as well.  I ordered the shrimp and pork belly ramen. I had reservations about ordering the ramen, but I had been craving ramen for a while, and this was the opportunity I had to have some. The waiter convinced me it was delicious, so I went with it. When it came out, I was sure that he had been right. Everything in the bowl looked great! The pork belly looked awesome, the cilantro, mushrooms, and sprouts were nice and fresh, the shrimp looked tasty, and the soft-boiled egg was delightfully tempting. I was hoping for a slightly larger bowl, but it looked great.  Once I started eating, though, I just wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, the ramen wasn't bad. It just wasn't all that great. The pork belly was cooked nicely, and the soft-boiled egg was perfect--nice and runny inside. But it was all rather bland. There wasn't much flavor to any of it. It was pretty meh to me.  Now the reason I added half a star and was tempted to add a full star came at the end of the meal. The bourbon black bottom pie. It's ridiculous. The chocolate ganache is fantastic, and the graham cracker crust adds a lovely texture. But what really did it was the salted caramel sauce that is on the side. Oh, man, this is good pie!  If it was all about the pie, this could be 5 stars. But my disappointment with the blandness of the ramen required a lower rating. Maybe a subsequent visit will convince me to bring up the rating."}

The reviews and pics led to some very high expectations.   Appetizers were very reasonable and all good.  Best two were the soft pretzel and provolone fondue and  the pork belly nachos.   For lunch had the tasty turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll with swiss and coleslaw. Touted by some as a signature dish, not quite sure why it was called turkey  pastrami. The sandwich came with french fries. Those were unremarkable, no crunch to it.    I think we had a good sampling  of the more popular appetizers. Overall it was more than an ok experience, different food choices were good. Left in a food coma...I don't think that was heat stress.  Worth another visit with inside seating."}

We had reserved a table for 13 for a graduation dinner and were seated at the first table inside the door (no problem so far). Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, but it didn't take long for things to go downhill. For different reasons, a few of us got up and walked outside throughout our 2 1/2 hours at the restaurant (picture taking, etc.). For unknown reasons, security had an issue with that AND with us. The people in our group ranged in age from 20 to 65, and I only mention that because more than half of our group was over the age of 40, and NONE of us were being loud, obnoxious,or drunk. First of all, the service was extremely slow, hence the 2 1/2 hours, and several of our appetizers and entrees contained toast or bread, which was so burnt you couldn't chew it or even cut it with a knife. Right before we left, the waiter came over and said that we were cut off. Thinking it had to be a joke, we asked both the waiter and bartender what we had done wrong and they both said that they didn't make that call, it was security. We then left in 4 separate groups, the last 2 standing beside their car waiting for a Lyft since they had a couple of drinks. At that time, they were in plain sight of security and as they were driving off, were flipped off by one of the security guys. Early the next morning when they went to get their car, they discovered it had thousands of dollars worth of damages from vandalism (it's a classic vehicle and several parts are irreplaceable) and the car had to be towed. We are about 99% sure it was security, but interestingly enough, there are no cameras on that side of the building. Will never go back there and the whole graduation experience was ruined for us. They actually deserve zero stars."}

But it was cook perfectly, just cause my palette didn't agree doesn't mean it's wrong.   The big let down here was the service. We were in on a slow night, in a pretty slow section but service seemed disoriented almost. We sat down, got a menu, and our server walked away. After that she came back and asked if we wanted any appetizers, and we ordered and she walked away again for the second time without taking our drink orders. I had to ask for drinks when she came back with the appetizers. After the appetizers, she took our orders and we didn't see her again until entree's came out, and again I had to request another drink without being asked.

I didn't have the chicken, I had the pub burger which was the normal cost of a burger and fry at a restaurant.   My thought is that they should have smaller options at a lower cost. The obesity problem in America is from places like this that over charge, so the person gorges themselves to get their money's worth. Where are the tapas? With a name like Culinary Dropout I expected smaller dishes.  Final note, I also hate how their valet is on the side of the railroad track instead of on Ash as it used to be.

I immediately called the location and they took my information down and told me they would call when they had a manager in. An hour and a half passed and I still had no call, so I went in. Once I reached the hostess stand, they grabbed me a manager immediately. Why wasn't I called when she arrived like they said? I explained the predicament and she checked all 3 places they would put it, found nothing, then called the waitress. The waitress claimed she gave it to another one of the girls in my party. When I called all of my friends, none of them had it. The manager also brought up the fact that I hadn't asked for my card back that night. I'm sorry, but what other restaurant do you go to where you have to ask for your debit card back from the waitress? I had clearly forgotten she had it since it had been nearly 2 hours after she had taken it. Opening tabs is not something I'm used to, I hadn't noticed. Her remark angered me, obviously.

We then proceeded to hang out for 3 hours and spend hundreds of dollars on drinks. I could understand her frustration if we were ordering waters and the cheapest food on the menu, but that definitely wasn't the case yet she had this attitude with us that only changed when the final bill came and she became Ms. Sunshine and Rainbows.

The first came within 10 minutes (not bad) and the second was still missing after 40 minutes- I'm networking so it doesn't piss me off, but I follow up with her saying I wanted to check up on the glass I ordered about 45 minutes ago. It comes right away so there is no problem until I go to cash out and get charged for 3 glasses. I tell her I only got 2 and she gets accusatory with me saying she delivered 3 (no honey, you did not). She fights me on it, but I stand firm and she says she needs to get her manager involved... Okayyyy, why do I need a play-by-play? Just fix it and don't overcharge me while giving awful service. Finally I get my bill back, but oh no that's not my card. I am with a big group so I call out the name on the card and I let her know the confusion. The cardholder laughs because my bill is less than hers and jokes that we should switch (ha, no thanks) and another 15 minutes later it gets fixed.   Positives: the couch was comfy  Negatives: rude waitress, food was overpriced, drinks were overpriced, slow service, food was just ok.   I'm not coming back and I will be very vocal about my opinion in the office group happy hour message board.   On a side note, one waiter took initiative and I wish he was our waiter because our service would have been amazing! When our waitress was ignoring us at the first table and was avoiding eye contact, a waiter with a unique name that started with an L (I think) offered us waters and gave us an excuse for the bad service (it was a weak excuse, but waiting on people isn't easy so I was willing to give her a break). Too bad the night only went downhill from there.  The culinary drop out must have also dropped out of customer service training (yes, I am proud of that)."}

The title is very descriptive of the experience because it feels like it's ran by a drop out. After waiting about an hour for a table, prepare for at least a 2 hour overpriced meal. The food is artesian inspired but is more basic tasting than an Instagram selfie with no filter. I'm surprised I even got my food after waiting 45+ minutes every time I've had the displeasure of dining here. My drink (the only good thing) was constantly empty and I never received an extra side of ketchup after 3 attempts. I'm convinced Chingy receives better service than this chillin' at the Holiday Inn ... Their scratch kitchen also ran out of tortilla chips AND meatloaf... UNFORGIVABLE.   If you're a basic wanna be hipster and have a lot of extra free time to overpay for mediocre artisan food that they probably ran out of... Feel free to come on by."}

Well that chance proved for a third and final time that I won't be visiting here much.  First time I went there I had a waiter who ignored my table almost the entire night. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich (which is normally a big hit) and found the flavors to be all wrong. I couldn't eat any of it.   Second time around my table ordered the antipasti meat and cheese board, which was delicious. The heirloom tomatoes were my favorite. I had the bourbon pie to end the night and that was also a big hit with me. But again, the service was awful and we were ignored most of the evening.  Upon my recent trip there, the restaurant took out everything I loved. The bourbon pie, the heirloom tomatoes, this certain kind of amazing cheese...they've all been taken off the menu. Those were the only reasons I came back. Now they're gone.   Oh well, I had already sat down. Might as well try the new menu item, cheddar and potato pierogies, right? Wrong. For $10, you only get 3 tiny pierogies. Are you kidding me?? It's also under the shareable items. How in the world do you split three tiny dumplings with any kind of group?

I will say that their service is definitely awesome. We loved our waitress! She was a total sweetheart for our table of 5. However, the food service was a bit lacking. :(  After waiting for something like 45 minutes to be seated (we had no reservations, so I highly recommend that), we finally sat down and took a gander at the menu. Note, we didn't mind the wait since we just hung out at the bar and ordered a few beers.  I ordered the Pretzels and Fondue appetizer for the table so we could share at our waitress' recommendation. Now, it IS tasty, but I didn't think it was anything amaaaazing. It's a heavy app, though, so if you're sharing for a table of, say, two people, you will be stuffed. STUFFED. lol.  The good news is that the P&F app came out swiftly like a coursing river. Unfortunately, our entrees did not come out with all the force of a great typhoon. :( In fact, it took our entrees nearly an HOUR to come out. :( Now, I understand that the kitchen was most likely backed up, but what I don't get is how 2 burgers were no longer hot but cooled down and how my salad (and my coworker's, since we ordered the same Butternut Squash & Kale salad) had missing items... namely the pecans, goat cheese, and a mere sprinkling of brussel sprouts.   So yeah, pretty sad about the salad, though our waitress was quick to run to the kitchen to get the missing items. The salad was delish besides the wait, but I felt bad for my table-mates who were digging into cool burgers. :/ That, coupled with the super long wait was no bueno.  I give this an AOK however due to our awesome waitress, the yummy salad despite everything else, awesome atmosphere and sweet bartenders. Also, they have cornhole and ping pong, which we *should have* utilized during our long wait, haha."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "***This Culinary Dropout has a great look (it takes up residence in a modern warehouse) and the flavors were there too; unfortunately, the food on hot courses was lukewarm to cold, which hurt the overall experience***  There is a string of Culinary Dropout restaurants throughout the Phoenix area. This gastropub features a variety of classic dishes like meatloaf, fish and chips, fried chicken, and more. The preparations are contemporary, but they are also fairly straight-up and safe. A few more globally inspired dishes like Korean style beef and ramen also appear on the menu.   I started with the soft pretzel bites with provolone cheese fondue. This was fairly good though there is a gastropub at the Wigwam serving a superior version. The preparation at Culinary Dropout is satisfying enough with a good pretzel crust on the bites and a creamy cheese fondue, but the pretzel bites were quite big (which results in a lot of bread that diminishes the impact of the salted pretzel crust) and the cheese fondue was not hot enough (in terms of temperature and not spiciness).   For my entree, I had the Korean style ribeye cap and the quality of beef was very noticeable. With ribeye cap, you get the interior of a ribeye but a more distinct exterior like hanger steak. This allows the kitchen to achieve a far superior and more crispy crust than a regular ribeye and that is exactly what happened here. The interior was juicy, tender and flavorful while the outside had a nice crispy char. The Korean marinade, thankfully, was not too spicy and thus did not overpower the natural flavor of the steak.   The garnishes were also cooked appropriately as the onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and bean sprouts were sautéed to the right texture. Unfortunately, everything on the plate was lukewarm to even slightly cold. This plate definitely sat a little too long on the pass.   Service was very friendly and the food came out at a quick pace. However, both lukewarm to cold food for both starter and entree was worrisome.   Prices were reasonable though prices for food in the Phoenix area tend to be more reasonable than other big city restaurants.   This Culinary Dropout has a great look. It is located in a big and new looking warehouse complex that houses several upscale and modern restaurants. The industrial look combined with the variety of seating and even lawn style games creates a lively and energetic atmosphere. Unfortunately, I felt the restaurant was slightly uncomfortable as the seating was a tad stiff and the room temperature was too warm (which was surprising; I thought the room would have been more drafty than warm given its warehouse location).   This Culinary Dropout near ASU has a great look and the menu serves fairly good food. However, the lukewarm and cold food worries me that guests may have a truly poor experience here from time to time. If you live in the area, this gastropub is worth trying considering the food quality and reasonable prices though I would suggest giving them a shot at a non-peak time.   This restaurant has a free parking lot. Complimentary valet is also available."}

Anyways, I decided to take my parents here for a nice, relaxing Saturday lunch... Not what I experienced.  We arrived and the server sat us right in front of a band playing music. It was waaaay too loud. I requested to move across the room immediately which they accommodated. I think they were ticked off though because our server checked up on us like once the entire time we were there until the last 10 minutes when we paid. No water refills...  We ordered mussels, their oft-posted pretzel appetizer, butternut squash ravioli, and steak. The steak was overlooked for a medium steak without much flavor, the pretzel rolls were too salty, even after we brushes off all the salt on the outside of the roll. That compounded with no water refill and we were barely able to eat them. The mussels were also overlooked so they were really tough and the sausage that was supposed to be in the mussels were like specks, about the size of crumbs. Highly misleading.   The one redeeming dish was the ravioli. It was slightly sweet with aromatic hints and well balanced. Nice dish.  The whole meal used up the $75 gift card but the one item I liked was the ravioli. My parents had one comment which I thought was funny. They said, We're glad it was free. The Red Lobster place was better. Hah!

First the pierogis were not all the way cooked through (iced potato's). The veggies weren't bad, but for the price I thought I was paying for Fox quality and got something an 18 yr old working a chili's whipped up after 10:00 PM.   Other people at my table you had been here before claimed that the pretzels with beer cheese was the best thing on the menu? Are you kidding me when your a Fox Concept and the most memorable bite was some pretzels and beer cheese? You know there were issues.   Finally, my entree was Costco green chili's sold in a glass jar at any local Costco with some braised pork and a rubberized egg on it. I paid 16 something for it and all I could taste was salt and cilantro. There was no balance in the dish whatsoever.   I must plead to the owners of this Fox Concept that I do not want my money back, but I would like to see quality in my next visit. But until then I would eat at your own risk."}

Two stars are knocked off for the valet service. They took our car, parked it, and brought it back with a broken driver's side handle. I called to talk to them about a solution and they referred me to the contracted valet company. I called them and was accused of leaving it with them broken and lying about the exchange with their workers. Yeah. Cool. Beware. The valet company is unscrupulous and careless."}

Unfortunately, this was the first visit for 3 of my family members and it may mean they never return to a Culinary Dropout.  It took 15 minutes for drink refills (water included in that).  We had their famous pretzel and cheese appetizer.  That was delicious.  My brother had a burger and found that it was good.  My sister in law had the chicken salad and said it was way overdressed.  My mother had the nachos app and disliked the thick greasy chips.  I had the ramen soup and it was so salty I could't eat the broth and barely any of the soup.  gross!  Given that it took 15 min for drink refills I couldn't choke down the soup.    They never came by to check on the food so none of it was sent back, we never saw the manager but at the beginning when he came to change a chair out telling us we couldn't use that one even though the hostess had put it there.  Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I am an extremely huge advocate for how amazing culinary dropout is. However, this location needs to take a few pointers from the other two locations. I didn't even get a chance to sit down in this restaurant before being treated like trash by their hostesses. The four airhead hostesses that you had working tonight need to learn their job before being sent out into the world of restaurant hostessing.   I've been a hostess. Your job is just that. To host and to be the first and last impression that your guests  have of your establishment. It's not hard to at least pretend to care about your customers.  Now that I've had my rant, let me tell you about my 2 minute experience that left a sour taste in my mouth about this particular culinary dropout location.   Upon walking into the establishment the hostesses just stared and didn't even greet us with a simple, hello. My boyfriend had to stand there for several moments before they acknowledged him. He told them how many it would be (it was going to be 4) and the hostesses, upon him asking how long the wait would be, responded I literally don't even know right now. And we just looked at them. Then they go further on to say, all of the tables we have for the rest of the night are going to reservations, but you can sit on the patio at an open high top. She also told us that one had just freed up and that we could have it. So, without even offering to show us the way, sends us out to look for the open table that supposedly exists. We go out there, no open high top. We walk back to the hostess stand and say to the girl that there are no open tables. She just replies, oh, sorry. You can sit at one of the couches on the patio.. But it's not full menu.  Oh. Thank you. I didn't come here to eat dinner. (Sarcasm).  When we tell them that we have no where to sit because we want to eat dinner, they again, blankly stare at us and respond with a less than sincere sorry.  My boyfriend is not patient and tells them we are leaving because they are refusing to even offer to help us find a table. Again, less than sincere, sorry as we walked out.   I understand that it is New Year's Eve and that you have a lot of people to accommodate, but your hostesses, instead of standing there at the host stand, clumped together, should be out doing everything they can to try and accommodate ALL of the guests who want to dine in your restaurant. (That includes bussing tables, walking the floor to find open tables, or find almost finished tables). I've been a hostess and a waitress and these girls did not know anything about customer service in the food industry. And even if you can't seat me tonight, at least try and act sympathetic and show me that you're doing everything in your power to treat your customers well. Otherwise you're going to continue to lose customers to Postino right down the road.  Again, I love culinary dropout as you can probably tell by my previous reviews of the other two locations, but this one needs some work. The other two locations have customer service down to a science."}

A gentleman from the kitchen came out to tell us one of our 3 orders of fried chicken were over cooked, so they were making the one order again. The fried chicken was supposed to have a breast, thigh, and drumstick. I took most of my order to go, and discovered once home, that my order had 2 thighs, no breast. Very disappointing. Not very impressed with the cold food, and didn't live up to the reviews. I called to let them know that they put 2 thighs, no breast in my order and to tell them my food was cold.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "A $550 dining experience that turned into thousands of dollars.   We had reservations for a party of 13 on May 11th to celebrate my daughter's graduation. We were seated at a table very close to the door nearest the valet parking. Our waiter was great and the service (drink and food arrival) was a tad on the slow side so there were a few times that different members of our party went outside to take pictures, grab presents from their vehicles and smoke. During this time, the doors were wide open with other customers going in and out while security was also standing at the door.  I myself went outside numerous times during our two and a half hours at the restaurant and each time was given a once over by security. I thought nothing of it at first and chalked it up to people watching on security's part.  We all finished our meals and some of our party ordered deserts and some ordered celebratory shots. Soon after, our waiter informed us we were cut off. When asked why or by who, he stated he had no idea why because it didn't come from him or the bartender but came from security. Alrighty. Squared up our bills and went to leave. Everyone started heading towards the parking lot while being followed by two security guards. We had two designated drivers whose vehicles were already full so my son called an Uber and while waiting for their ride, everyone waited with them by his car while he grabbed a few personal items. When the Uber showed up, they got in and everyone else walked to their vehicles (including back to the valet area). While pulling out, the Uber vehicle was flipped off by one of the security guards who were now both standing at the doors facing the larger parking lot. No one thought much of that at the time other than a WTF. Until the next morning.  My son's car was vandalized beyond belief. A smashed drivers side window, dents and footprints from them kicking the car, keyed everywhere and even damn puncture holes in the body. A mint condition 1993 Nissan 300 ZX. Which, by the way, is a very rare historic vehicle.  It was brought to the GM's attention and she came out and took pictures of the vehicle. When asked about security cameras, she stated that they were only on the door by valet. She went and looked at the cameras and stated that her managers personally walked security out to their vehicles at 1:45 am and that it was on camera. Managers walk security out to their cars?? Shouldn't it be the other way around? We asked to see the tape as we should have been on it as well being followed by security and she offered to send it but never did.  She offered to speak with her night staff that came in later in the day and call back. As you can imagine, no one knew or saw anything. When she asked if there was anything she could do, short of paying to have the vehicle fixed, what exactly was she offering? So, we asked for a refund of the amount spent at the restaurant to offset the thousands in repairs and she seemed surprised we even suggested it. She said it was the first she was hearing about any bad service. That's not the point. We didn't complain about the restaurant itself but the destruction of our property and since SHE ASKED what she could do, we took her up on it. No dice. She then pointed out that this happens all the time as if we aren't the only unfortunate customers.  We then got a call from Erica, the Regional Operations Manager who not only offered the refund knowing how expensive the repairs would be but also was way more interested than Alyssa, the GM looking into what happened. She also informed us that security has zero say when a customer is cut off. It's strictly up to managers and bartenders. Neither of which came to our table, and even served my daughter another drink immediately after being cut off. She also seemed very surprised to hear that this is a common occurrence and it was not to her knowledge.  Hopefully security gets their shit together and this is looked into and it never happens to anyone else. Cameras definitely need to be placed outside the doors facing the larger lot."}

Probably the best food I've had. Service though...absolutely terrible. We had a freak ping pong accident where a guy in our party cut his head open. The bartender couldn't have been more rude and unprofessional about it. He complained about helping him get a rag, having to clean up a little blood (literally four drops), and gave us nothing but a bad attitude the entire time we were at the bar.   Moving onto the joke of a manager. After the ping pong incident, we were harassed by a fellow customer. After explaining the situation to the manager, he rolled his eyes and told us there was nothing he could do. Well, there's a lot you could do but you're too lazy to do it.   I'll end my rant now.

Little that could be called healthy eating, our impression was that this was a young mans restaurant. One of us had the cannelloni, which was good. Tomato, asparagus and shallot in a butter sauce with Parmesan. Another had the kale and sweet corn salad. Mostly kale with tiny amounts of roasted cauliflower, snap peas (2), avocado, almonds, goat cheese. It was suppose to have roasted beets, but I never found them. Dressing was bland and unremarkable. Our third had the BBQ pork belly nachos. Interestingchips with a little pork belly, a nice amount of guacamole, some salty black beans, covered with a glutenous cheese sauce that weighed down everything and contributed to a general sogginess after about 5 minutes.   Servers near us were dressed in short shorts - lace or leather, contributing to a hooters- like atmosphere. Service was good, however.  Parking is challenging, a short trek across a dirt drive. About half a city block. Only one handicap spot near the door that we can see. Grateful we didn't need it.  Food was pricey for what you got - not worth it"}

He remembered details of our order, was friendly and attentive when he needed to be. Very cool atmosphere, although I left with half my hearing and half my voice from the extreme noise. Not to sound like a 90-year-old telling them to tone down that racket, but the music was so loud and we were seated at an awkward 2-top in between other tables. Thus between the large party next to us on either side within inches and the music a few feet away, all we could do is stare awkwardly at each other and text from across the table to communicate. Now, that's a hot date!   The music was good and started just after 9 PM on a Friday(picture of stage). I wish they had placed the stage in the patio/party area and built a designated little dance floor because we would have jammed out for a bit since we couldn't talk or function with the noise otherwise.   I ordered a classic mule drink (which was not as sweet as usual elsewhere) and my husband got the brown bag special(a random, surprise can of beer). This was a cool, cheap concept and you get to try a beer you otherwise would not have picked. He liked it a lot!   Due to the soft pretzel hype and our unhealthy love of fake cheese, we got the pretzel app. Wanted to love it but were disappointed. The cheese wasn't melted or warm and had no flavor. The pretzels were much bigger than anticipated (more like small roll size) and were a good consistency. Unfortunately, they didn't have any flavor. Quick dip in butter or salt would have added a little something.   For entrees, we had fish and chips and the pub burger. The burger was juicy and flavorful with an awesome smokey taste to the meat. The fish was pretty good with a bit of a spice, but the slaw was probably the best part of the dish. Both meals came with cold, seasoning-free, limp fries that had clearly been sitting for awhile and a tiny tin bowl with a squirt of ketchup. I would recommend a different side.   We were bummed that all of the bags and ping pong areas were taken. Assuming these are open more frequently at off peak times of day. As an FYI, we were carded twice for entry. Not sure if this is only for weekends or other times as well. Food runners seemed very disorganized. We were asked three times if an item they were holding was something we ordered. They asked all the tables around us.   Overall, we are glad we tried this place but are not itching to go back...at least not on a weekend when it is so loud and busy.

We had 4 parents outside on duty at a time watching our group and the monopoly man AKA Jorge, kept telling us we needed to have a parent at each area. We were sitting at a table with our appetizers and cocktails right where our kids were playing cornhole and we had a group of 4-12 year olds not 20 feet away that we were playing ping pong. There was no where to sit and have a cocktail or appetizer near the ping pong tables or foozball table. If the sign said something about parent supervision I wouldn't be writing this but the fact that we were supervising and being criticized, chastised in a very condescending way by someone who is not a mother was very discouraging.

I went with the Greek Chicken Pasty and my husband decided on the Guiness Stew Pasty and a side of baked chips to share. The food was great, but unfortunately, the entire experience was overshadowed by the fact that staff refuses to enforce the No Smoking on the Patio rule. There was a patron at the table next to us smoking despite sitting right in front of a sign - staff obviously didn't care as nothing was said. I finally let one of the servers passing by know that someone was smoking and the response was pretty nonchalant; however, they did ask that person to step outside the patio. The group sharing our table was very appreciate especially considering there were several small children nearby.

So then I go to cut up the chicken breast and it is definitely slathered in spaghetti sauce. So now I have a ranch salad and a spaghetti sauce covered chicken breast. Awkward.  Because my lunch hour was almost over and I was starving, I decided, fine..I'll just eat them separately and call it a meal. Both were awful.

I don't know if it was just that night, or permanently, but I was sad. Our server was great, though. For a busy night, he was pretty attentive."}

J ordered a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup and an order oven chips with garlic.   My Pasty - The Mexican J's Pasty - Bangers and Mash  The soup was awesome - he shared a few spoonfuls with me and Baby C.  Baby C went crazy for it!    My Pasty - Very tasty.  The right amount of spice.  Not oily.  Very filling!  I could only eat 1/2 of my pasty.    J didn't like his pasty all that much.  He said it was extremely salty and heavy.  Wished he would have ordered something else instead of trying to go somewhat authentic.    The oven chips were kind of a disappointment.  I wouldn't order them again due to a good portion of them being still on the raw side.      So it was kind of a hit or miss depending on what you ordered.  Might be able to talk J into going back again and have him try a different pasty."}

I ate half and I was pretty much set.  The interior is dark as all hell. I walked in and I nearly bumped into someone. It's probably the darkest restaurant I've ever seen. Each table gets this tiny light that comes down from the ceiling. I can't imagine eating inside.  So we ate outside on the awkwardly too big wooden tables and sat on the immobile seats that are placed too far from the table.  The waiter was very chill. Too chill? Like skater boy chill.   I read that the other locations are better, so I would probably eat at one of those places rather than the tempe location."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I had eaten here a few years ago when they first opened, but didn't remember too much about it other than cheap Irish Car Bombs.  It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.    I'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.    I could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.  As for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "To get this out of the way up front, the storefront picture here appears not to be the Tempe location. Maybe it's the Mesa place?  The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a kitchen with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.  The employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.  At $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.  The place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).  Bottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.  As the rating states, it's A-OK."}

Last time I came in I ordered the tikka masala salad, now I know they may be busy, but over an hour for a salad is pretty poor service. The time before that I was served a cold pasty and you could tell it had sat for quite a while before making it to my table. Each time I pointed these things out and was met with blank stares or a passive we're working on it.

We had an awkward few minutes at the bar (sitting in front of people's empty plates), but someone finally gave us menus.   We ordered draft beer - Rogue Hazelnut Brown, which happens to be one of our favorites. I've never seen it on tap before, so we were pretty excited to try it. It did not disappoint! We ordered our pasties; I had the bangers and mash and my husband had the chicken tikka masala. I think we'd agree that they were both good, but nothing mind-blowing.  My husband is from England and thought the sausages didn't taste authentic. They were extremely sage-y and a bit tough. I was a bit disappointed that the mash was really just chunks of potatoes. The red wine gravy served on the side was good.   I think it was a bit pricey for what we got - two pasties and two beers for $28. I wouldn't make a special trip to Tempe to have it again."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Let me first start off by saying that I love Cornish Pasty. So why the three star review? Well, their food is great, but the service is lousy. But let me back up a bit.  The very first time someone told me about The Pasty, as I refer to it, they described a pasty as a gourmet hot pocket. Let me tell you, that did not sound appealing. Despite how great they tried to make it sound, I could not get over the idea of a gourmet hot pocket. So I never checked it out until maybe a year ago when I was recommended by another friend, and figured I'd just give it a shot. It was delightful!  I've since been to The Pasty multiple times. It's the food that keeps me coming back. The Pilgrim is like Thanksgiving! I get it almost every time. It's a combination of turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and other wonderful flavors inside. Served with a side of cranberry sauce and a red wine gravy. I'm not too crazy about the gravy, but the cranberry sauce is awesome. I've also tried their Greek salad and black bean soup, which are just as wonderful. I love the bread that comes with the soup, and the dressing on the salad.  Although this location is closer to my house, I prefer going to the one on Guadalupe and Dobson because the service is slightly better (although both locations have poor service). And this location on University is way too dark and full of hipsters. But, I guess people dig that nowadays.  The main reason I'm writing this review is because of a trip I made to this location yesterday. I went with my boyfriend and we split all three items mentioned above. The Greek salad, black bean soup, and The Pilgrim. I was starving and was hoping our server would bring the soup and salad out first. I was thrilled when she came back after a couple minutes with the soup and was hoping the salad would come out shortly after. I love bread and when we ran out of bread (meaning after I scarfed all the bread down), I patiently waited for our server to come back around so I could ask for more bread, as well as the status on our salad. Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave. I'm used to the service being not so great, but this was just awful.  I thought maybe if I wrote a review about my last experience, they'd change the service up or hire better servers. Serving itself isn't very hard, I know, I've done it. And it doesn't take much effort to check up on a table. But the people who work at The Pasty just don't seem to care about anything. I guess that's just a hipster thing. (I would love to see their interview process, if there even is one. Do you know how to carry food? Yes. Okay, you're hired.)  Anyway, I think I will be driving out of the way to go to the other Pasty instead. Since their servers are a little more attentive and I can actually see who I'm eating with, and what I'm eating for that matter. Hah, I can only imagine what that place looks like in the light. Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.  It's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on. If you're the type that doesn't like their server to stop by a lot, or you don't need any refills, then this place would be perfect for you."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I hoped for more from Cornish Pasty Co.  I ordered the Rosemary Chicken (pictured) and while the chicken was pleasantly moist, there was absolutely NO hint of rosemary.  The peppers were fine, but the entire pasty was overpowered by the taste of vinegar the peppers were soaked in.  :(  I also ordered a half-baked Oggie (pictured) to go for a friend and am told it largely tasted like a pot pie.  I guess that's fine if that's what you're looking for, but the only flavor stand out seemed to be the wine-flavored gravy.  The dining room near the entrance was rather small, but it seems they're expanding into the space next door to create a second, larger dining room and second bar (pictured.)  It's unclear if they intend to continue remodeling or if it's complete, but it currently has a combination of very dated details as well as newer, more modern ones.  The second dining room is filled with old church pews for seating which I have mixed feelings about.  I'm happy to see they've been re-purposed, but can't help but wonder how many funerals they've seen.  It's slightly creepy while trying to eat.  The server was nice enough, but I have a pet peeve about restaurant cleanliness.  It was rather slow and the server amused himself between visits to the table by playing darts with another patron.  I could care less how he spends his down time, but would have appreciated seeing him wash his hands after touching the same darts other people have used.  Who knows where THEIR hands have been???  If I ever pay CPC another visit, I think I'll skip the entree and try dessert, instead.  Or better yet, skip the dessert and plunk down $3 for a Happy Hour Car Bomb and hope they offer free WiFi by then.  Hopefully, the bartender's hands will be clean."}

I've had many experiences with Cornish Pasty. My friends love it, and when it comes to the food, I love it too. (Especially the pork pasty.)  I've only had one good one though--and that was when I sat directly at the bar and told the woman standing there what I wanted.   The a few of the other times happened something like this:  1. Went in alone, waited fifteen minutes for anyone to come over and even wipe down my table, let alone ask for a drink or dinner order.  2. Went there with 4 other friends, waited 2 hours for a table, and the gentleman acting the 'host' was especially rude when we would ask him about how long he thought it would be (roughly ever 30 minutes) and he always said Looks like 15 more minutes. Then when we were finally seated our drinks came back half empty and my pasty was cold in the center.  The truth is, is that while the food is great the company needs to retrain it's workers. Customer service should be at the top of their list, and from what I can tell it's at the bottom."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Things to know about the pasty:  #1. It's pronounced PAST-ee, not PASTE-ee. One you eat; the other taunts you. #2. It's meant to be filling because the damn thing was invented for miners and as such, was never intended to be served with gravy.  Things to know about the establishment itself:  #1. It's dark inside for a reason - to mimic a mine, where the pasty was standard fare back in Britain, not because they're trying to be hipsters. The clientele does that. #2. The patio is smoker and pet friendly. Inside, the long tables and bench seats aren't particularly convenient for anyone with long legs or a rubenesque shape.  Review:  Tried the Oggie for myself and a Porky for the little lady. She got a cup of the potato and leek soup and loved it. But with the full slice of bread it is served with, she couldn't eat the entire pasty herself. Both were quite delish, however.  I was disappointed that the ONE beer (Hefeweizen) I was longing for out of the many fine selections on tap was out. But, our waitress recommended I try a Hoegaarden instead. I requested a slice of orange added for good measure and found it to be an acceptable balance to the Oggie's heaviness.  Honestly, I come from Wisconsin near the U.P. of Michigan and am partial to their style of pasty up in the Yoop. Not that what I had wasn't tasty, but the red wine gravy was a -- shall I say, unusual? -- flavor accompaniment. It's just a personal bias of mine.  Anyone who has never had a pasty before will enjoy any selection on the menu."}

The glass light over our table was broken and dusty. it wasn't one of the newer fixtures but one of the old ones that hangs just above eye level. all this accentuated with some very deep hard 70s and 80s rock music with some pretty amazing guitar riffs but very odd for a restaurant. The restrooms during our visit were completely ignored by the staff as they were dirty, and unattended for probably hours in a busy restaurant. They are also ignored by the owners and managers because of broken fixtures like paper towel and TP dispensers bad paint and lighting and a lot of graffiti.  Service was ok, took orders brought food, that's it. there were 11 empty glasses on the table when our party of 4 left. Maybe managers can find a better way to get a side of lemon slices to the table as mine arrived on a plastic drink lid.  The bacon wrapped meatballs arrived hot and greasy, they tasted fine, but I had to re think my salad order when I notice only 3 poorly chopped pieces of browning romaine lettuce that was used to garnish under the caldron that held the meatballs.  All of the pasties looked smaller then I remember and so was my Greek salad, Maybe I am just spoiled by the Scottsdale location but the salad bowl was tiny and deep and chipped. It was also the first time in many orders that I thought I never want to order that again. We almost always start with one, but this time I ordered my own.

From my POV: Pretty chillaxed place.  The food is incredibly greasy if you're into that stuff.  It was pretty different for my taste. (Then again, I'm a VERY picky eater) I had the mashers and bangers (mashed potato and pork stuffed into a greasy shell like that on a chicken pot pie except richer in fat). It was so and so. Kind of bland.  Second time around, I had the Italian style one with Salami and other yummy stuff in it. It was much better than the bland mashers and bangers.

The service was terrible- they acted like we should have known to seat ourselves and weren't friendly or helpful, but doing the bare minimum assuming we'd been there before.  I'd never had a pasty before, and I was not impressed.  I got the philly cheesesteak which the waiter informed was nothing like an actual philly cheesesteak.  As far as my experience goes, they include steak, cheese, mushrooms, peppers- all of which were also in the pasty.  The difference was, this steak was chewy and flavorless, I didn't taste any cheese, and there were more green peppers than any other ingredient.  The pastry part was good,  but undercooked.    I was excited that they had specific sauces to pair with each pasty.  The server allowed me to try both- a mustard one and a red wine one.  I found both to be gross and a terrible combination with the pasty.   I just want to emphasize that I am not a picky eater and enjoy most food.  I was extremely disappointed that I spent money there.  Neither me nor my coworker finished our food and the waiter looked at us oddly when we didn't want to take the rest to go. No thanks. We were both totally confused by why people rave about this place.  Perhaps it is the good beer they serve..."}

The peppers were fine, but the entire pasty was overpowered by the taste of vinegar the peppers were soaked in.  :(  I also ordered a half-baked Oggie (pictured) to go for a friend and am told it largely tasted like a pot pie.  I guess that's fine of that's what you're looking for, but the only flavor stand out seemed to be the wine-flavored gravy.  The dining room near the entrance was rather small, but it seems they're expanding into the space next door to create a second, larger dining room and second bar (pictured.)  It's unclear if they intend to continue remodeling or of it's complete, but it currently has a combination of very dated details as well as newer, more modern ones.  The second dining room is filled with old church pews for seating which I have mixed feelings about.  I'm happy to see they've been re-purposed, but can't help but wonder how many funerals they've seen.  It's slightly creepy while trying to eat.  The sever was nice enough, but I have a pet peeve about restaurant cleanliness.  It was rather slow and the server amused himself between visits to the table by playing darts with another patron.  I could care less how he spends his down time, but would have appreciated seeing him wash his hands after touching the same darts other people have used.  Who knows where THEIR hands have been???  If I ever pay CPC another visit, I think I'll skip the entree and try dessert, instead.  Or better yet, skip the dessert and plunk down $3 for a Happy Hour Car Bomb and hope they offer free WiFi by then.  Hopefully, the bartender's hands will be clean."}

The guys were friendly and my food was ready however they had my food on a plate and not prepared for take out. I had a seat while they got it together.  I'd say my pasty was very rich, spicy and flavorful.  I'm used to pepper so I'm guessing it may be too spicy for some. The pasty was full of meat and I didn't feel slighted in the least.

I went to Cornish pasty at around 4:30 PM with my service dog, and someone approached us and told me I would have to sit on the patio; I politely told this man that my dog is a service dog (he was wearing his working vest and everything) and he proceeded to point out that my dog was a pug (which he is indeed) and that we must sit outside because only service dogs are allowed inside. I very nicely repeated that he IS a fully certified SERVICE dog and he once again pointed out towards the patio.   Since my boyfriend's sister was in town from Louisiana and she really wanted to try pasties, I decided to be the bigger person and walked myself and my service dog to the patio.   I am honestly really disappointed because my dog should be allowed to go anywhere with me, and I feel like just because he isn't a lab or a German Shepard or a more commonly seen service dog he is not taken seriously, but he is fully certified to assist me, so what happened was extremely unfair and maybe illegal?   I most likely will not be visiting any Cornish Pasty in the future, but would like to let others know that this establishment does not respect individuals with disabilities."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I tried the southwest chicken pasty and it was very tasty. The crust was thin, crispy, and flavorful. The mixture of chicken, cheese, beans, corn, and salsa inside had a nice and slightly spicy Mexican flare. The pasty was something like $6 and plenty for one person. The food is definitely the high point for this place.  The place was very busy when we arrived with about 8 people and we had to wait a long time to snatch a table (we were on the list but they don't appear to actually honor any such arrangements versus a free-for-all). There was also only one server running around the whole place, so it was difficult to place orders, get refills, remove leftover encrusted plates, etc. The drinks are priced relatively low and there were many types of beers on tap, which probably makes it a popular place for the college crowd.   Overall, this might be a nice place to actually dine if it had better service and wasn't such a dive bar rather than an eatery. It would be nice if there were separate areas for a dinning room and bar. Right now, it seems like it really wants to be a bar, but it happens to randomly serve some good food."}

Their vegan pastys are not as well made either and fall apart every time I have had them from this location. They were also out of mushy peas, didn't offer us more water or beer when we were all clearly out of drinks. Just little things that made it less of an experience than the other location.

So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something....   Service~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....  Food~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....  So for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!"}

Well that's all relative and even for a kid that knocks off chorizo and hot wings without an issue; found it on the spicy side.  - Wife's came with an option for sauce; she said BBQ and got 1000 island.  - Chips came out soggy  Overall the food was decent and the portions on the large side.

As for taste, I definitely give the edge to the salmon.    For dessert, I tried the Strawberry Palova.  It was good, but very rich so I could only a eat half of it.  The best thing about this place is that its very affordable for those who eat on a budget.  We had two pasties, dessert, 3 glasses of wine and a Sprite for less than $50.  If you've never been, I definitely recommend checking out this place."}

Several companions and I visited the Tempe location for dinner. The food was very similar to the food prepped at the Mesa location, but that is where the similarities end.  Compared to the Mesa location, the Tempe one is both a lot smaller and darker. I felt like I was going into a dungeon since our table was in a dark corner all the way in the back.  Our food was good, but the lack of sanitation was very apparent. Our utensils were dirty and had to be replaced, and then the replacements were found to be dirty and had to be replaced. This was not a good sign.   Floors could use a good vacuuming, as the area around us was littered with all sorts of items from pieces of food to pieces of paper and even a cigarette butt! I'm not sure how a cigarette butt got on the floor, since no restaurants allow smoking anymore, but there it was, saying hello to us.  Service was much slower than the Mesa location, and our server had a laissez-faire attitude that did not speak well for them. They were more interested in chatting with other servers than waiting on our table.  I've given the three stars only because the food is the same tasty dishes that are served in Mesa, but as far as I am concerned, this place needs a visit from the owner and from the health department."}

Service wasn't anything to rave about, the facility was a bit dank, the seating outside was very uncomfortable, and the pasty I had was definitely nothing to run home and tell mom about. I'd understand the ratings if the prices per pasty weren't 9+ dollars, it'd be a cool place for college kids to get an ok sized hot pocket for a decent price, if they were more like 4 dollars.     I ordered the bangers and mash, steak/sausage and mashed potatoes wrapped in a crust. Not sure what expect from that, but it tasted just as it sounds. Again, I'll reiterate, not worth the price per pasty and definitely not a 4.5 star establishment nor a 4.5 star product."}

Any foodie knows there is more to a restaurant experience than a great product. An amazing restaurant has three basics covered:1) customer service 2) great food offerings 3) an overall great experience. This place lacks customer service which kills the experience. I stood there on a packed Tuesday and saw 3-5 different employees walk by with no acknowledgement that I existed. No eye contact, no greeting, no words at all! After 10 mins and a line out the door I left irritated and ticked.   I sympathize with the youth movement and the college atmosphere this place has, however customer service needs to be emphasized to the men and women working the floor. They are the face of your store and if this trend continues, eventually customers will get fed up and go elsewhere. If I am an owner I would be pissed if this negative behavior was going on in my business. The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles. The staff I saw working tonight looked lazy and tired. Maybe due to the high temperature of the restaurant however with poor customer service and lack of a face in the entrance greeting me with a smile and a friendly greeting, it leaves me feeling like you don't want my money and you don't care enough about your customers standing around. Eventually the attitude of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worry about customer service will come back to bite them in the butt.   Areas for improvement  The waiters should be focused on turning tables and getting the checks as soon as the dessert is finished as opposed to walking around with their heads cut off. More tables being turned equates to more tips. I saw 4-6 tables sitting talking on their phone when they could have been served their checks or ordered more food. My avg time from start to finish was between 90-120 mins! You cut my time in the restaurant to 60 mins with efficient service and food running from the kitchen this place could double its profits and increase tips.   They need someone to work the front and greet the customers and let them know they are wanted, appreciated and they want to provide me with a great meal!   Drinks out in under 5 mins from order (I waited 20 mins and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the evening and I had to remind her so 30 mins for a pint of beer...total wait time for 2 drinks: 50 mins  Notification on food times (depends on who is working)   Challenge your servers to turn tables faster   Servers need to be smiling and social"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Came here on a recommendation from a friend after a volunteer project and I was not impressed. First off, the entrance to the restaurant is not on University Dr but rather on S. Hardy Dr.   Upon entering, my eyes had to adjust to the extremely dark lighting and interior. There are several entrances to the place so you might have to walk around a bit to get to the main dining area. We walked through the bar area (which smelled like a college pub) to arrive at the main dining area which was fairly empty. There was only one other table occupied besides ours and a couple patrons at the bar. After, we were at a loss of what to do as no one directed us towards a table or told us to seat ourselves. Finally, we asked the chef and he said you can grab any table you want. My friend went up to get menus herself and we perused for several minutes before our waitress arrived. She was helpful in taking our order but she certainly took her time in attending to us and serving our food. Which was confusing to me as there was only one other table she had to attend to.   When I asked her what the red wine gravy was made of, she was confused by my question and did not answer correctly. She did state that the alcohol evaporates however I could clearly taste it when I ate it with my pasty.   This place's only saving grace was its food. I ordered the Oggie pasty which was wonderful except the meat tasted slightly undercooked. My friends all loved their pasties and the flavors came together beautifully.   They did split the check between four credit cards.  Overall, I would not come back, nor would I recommend this place to others. At post, take your food togo because the atmosphere of the restaurant definitely downgrades the experience."}

For the first time, I went to a Yelp-recommended place and was very disappointed.   First of all, the place is a dump. It's run down and kind of dirty...or at least gives off a dirty feel.I have seen the new Pasty that is over on Guadalupe in Mesa and the decor is very nice and it's clean.  This location is not wheelchair friendly at all and don't bother bringing more than 4 people unless you plan to stand at the bar.   I'm not sure if they were employees or just friends of the employees who were working there but there was a group of college age guys hanging around both behind the counter pouring their own drinks and lounging in front of the counter who were just filthy. They had dirty beards, dirty hair, dirty ripped up clothes....I had no idea that the new look in college guys was homeless-chic.    The food was....eh. My son had the meat and cheese pasty and I had the rueben. We shared our pasties and I was no more impressed with the meat and cheese than I was with the rueben. They weren't bad...they were just eh at best. You get the pasty...no side dish, no salad, no nothing. It's not really a value.   Our server was pleasant but nothing special. She served our food and kept our cokes filled. It was clear that the focus was on the bar. There were about 9 people just hanging out at the bar, which is fine, but the place isn't advertised as a bar. I had brought my 8 year old son and this place is really not kid friendly given the amount of attention given to the bar and the dirty patrons/employees who were hanging around.   If I do go back to Cornish Pasty it will likely be at the newer location which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1 because as a chain, it might be worth the 2nd visit.

Two of us got soft drinks (soda + root beer), and they were FLAT. As in nary a bubble to be seen flat.  We told the waitress, and it was about 10 minutes later with some fresh bubbly sodas.  Did I mention they were out of a ton of things? We eventually ended up with potato wedges (out of the fries), lamb pasty, thanksgiving pasty, leak + potato soup, and english toffee pudding. Why do establishments think it's cute to rename products which already have a perfectly acceptable name (I'm looking at you, starbucks)?   Before the food could come out, they seated a party of 7 LARGE individuals at our communal bench. We are a party of 4 normal to slender individuals, but the amount of human flesh pushed up to us was ridiculous.  There's personal space, and then there's hello, you are practically in my lap! Seriously, their party should have gotten a whole communal table to themselves because it was absurd.  Food came - it was hot, and everyone seemed happy. I had the toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. Really enjoyable, but it's hard to eat when your arms are squished by your side due to overflowing human flesh that's not yours, or your friend's.

I have always loved their food and (once I was old enough to drink), their beer selection, but over the past year I have noticed a severe decline in service.  It has gotten so bad that, after last night, I am afraid to say that I do not plan on returning to this restaurant again.  I live right down the street from Cornish Pasty Co., and have dined in and gotten carry-out whenever I could convince my boyfriend to go for their food (he apparently doesn't crave their pasty selection as much as I do).  We've sat at the bar and it's been decent service, but when ordering carry-out and dining in the restaurant, I've noticed service worsening, and becoming rude and dismissive.    To begin with, there is no signage upon entering the restaurant, so you just have to know whether or not to seat yourself or go to the back to pick up a carryout order.  (I suppose it's the hipster thing nowadays).  The last time I went to pick up carry out, I was summarily ignored by at least three servers before butting in on one of their conversations to state that I was there to pick up an order.  Their attitudes across the board were unfriendly, and they did not acknowledge the presence of either me, or the other customers waiting to get their orders for carry out.  Last night, my boyfriend and I decided to give them another try to dine-in.  After standing in the doorway for about a minute (we couldn't remember if we could just seat ourselves or not), a server acknowledged us in a friendly manner and invited us to sit anywhere.  After choosing a seat, we waited over five minutes (during this time tracking down our own menus and beer lists), while 2 different bussers walked past us twice, and 3 different servers walked past our area.  During this time, no one acknowledged us, no busser brought us water (despite walking straight past our area with a water pitcher).  After a busser brought water to a group that had literally just sat down, we decided to just leave.  My boyfriend informed the manager of the poor service on our way out, and the manager was polite, but did not offer to rectify the situation in any manner.  I understand that all places have bad nights, but as I said, this has been a trend that we have noticed over the last year (maybe their expansion stressed the quality of service?), and we do not care to spend our hard-earned money at a place where we are ignored and apparently invisible every time we have gone there in the recent past; plus, their food is good, but not good enough to put up with sub-par service.  We'd much rather go to one of the restaurants in downtown Phoenix that has fantastic service and better food, which is what we did last night."}

You can watch the guys cooking behind the bar. Cleanliness: It was pretty clean and believe me I am always looking. There is 1 unisex bathroom, my hubby used it and said it was ok. Food: We ordered the Oogie (beef, potato, onion and rutabaga with red wine sauce) and the Pilgrim (turkey/chicken, stuffing, sweet potato with cranberry sauce on the side).  We split them. While good size they do not come with any other vegie, salad or garnish. These were priced at $6.50 and $8 respectively. I would never order the Oggie again because the beef was NOT tender! It was quite tough and the potato and rutabaga were undercooked. The Pilgrim said on the menu turkey/chicken but when I asked the waitress she said it was chicken. When I got it I saw that they use white and dark meat. The sweet potato was cut in small cubes and they seemed dry. It had a good flavor but just was not exciting enough to get me to go back. Staff: The waitress was friendly and didn't mind answering questions because it was our first time. My hubby had a soda and it never got refilled..she finally asked when left the bill.

To begin, the place itself is really dark (kind of divey) which I'm not a huge fan of. Others would probably like it, but at 1pm, I want there to be a little bit of light in a building so I can see what I'm eating, others at the table, etc.   The pasty was ok in my opinion. The pastry itself is flaky and was pretty good. It seemed though that the filling varied at the table --depending on what you order, you may get something dry. I ended up getting a pasty that was supposed to be filled with spicy chicken and green chile but the chicken wasn't that spicy. The chile was just ok considering that we're in the southwest.   Drinks seemed expensive (and I'm talking about sodas here) and they charge for refills? I ended up getting a water.   Overall, I wasn't as impressed as others clearly are.

First thought was how dark and weird this place was when I first walked up and opened the doors!  What is this a vampire joint!?  Why so dark!?  I guess the sun will melt away the patrons.  I've heard about the meat pies of the CPC and finally made my way here.  I ordered The Oggie - The Traditional Pasty.  Not bad and very good to say, but I do recommend having it during the winter months.  It's pretty hot during the summer here in PHX if you haven't notice.  I would say the CPC is a seasonal restaurant and perfect during the cooler months.  Unless you need your meat pie fix!  Service was good overall and quick.  Needless to say they had more employees that day then Vampires. - Enjoy!"}

It was not in every bite, just some ingredient made it taste terrible. The waiter was not around at all so we had noone to tell. I had to go up to the bar to pay the bill because there were no servers walking about. I won't be returning. Terrible service and something in our food made it inedible."}

If anyone ventures to order the lamb and mint cornish pasty, please let me know if you find any meat in it!  Cos I couldn't find any in mine, just layers and layers of potatoes.  When I later told another ethnic dining buddy that I wasn't going back to Cornish Pasty, he (not eating with me, but went another time) said he ordered same and could not find the lamb in it, either.  He even told the manager, who said the cook musta made a mistake and forgot the lamb.  See if they make a mistake on yours, too.  If you order another lamb pasty, LMK if you find the lamb in that one, too.  Eating these pasties is like mining.  You don't see what you are getting till you get there with your mouth and fork, cos it visually hidden inside the pastry shell, so you keep digging and digging for the lamb.  Cost me $12 + for a potato pasty incl tax and tip.  BaaaahhhhhhD."}

Last night was my second visit and my hope is that it was an off night because we had pretty lousy service and the food was not up to the par set at my previous visit.   We walked in and were told to take a table anywhere. We picked a spot that had been covered in crumbs and there was dried food on one of the menus sitting there. Several minutes passed and we were finally able to flag someone down to wipe down the table. At least another 10 minutes pass before I am able to flag a server to place a drink and food order - I asked if we could get our server and the woman told me it was her we were looking for. We asked to start with some oven fries and were informed it will take a long as the pasties to make.' Ok, this is fine. My brother had a chicken pot pie pasty and I had the chicken tikka masala pasty which I remembered as being so great from my last visit. And then...the wait.....was looong. Much longer than anticipated. I hope this was just an off night...in the meantime, it will be a while before I'd consider returning."}

The crowd seemed to be having fun, so must know what they are getting into."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "FOOD: I don't know why Cornish Pasty is listed as British food. Most of the choices of pasties are not British at all. For those of you who don't know what a pasty is, it's basically a baked pastry case filled with your choice of ingredients. Very much resembles a pie. Pasties are the only item on the menu but there are a wide variety of flavors. I had the Oggy, and it was enjoyable mostly because it was different than most foods I eat for lunch or have even tried before (and it seemed the most British). The ingredients are not amazing, but overall it was a good lunch. Dip your pasty in ketchup so it isn't so dry.   PRICE: The pasties are kinda expensive for what you get. A pasty will run for about $8-9 without any sides. The pasties aren't very large, but will be enough for a lunch.   SERVICE: We were served by a nice girl, and the lunch went very smoothly.   ATMOSPHERE: Very thin dining area. Only one table can sit 3 people, the rest are bar stools and 2 person tables. Didn't really seem British with the metal rock playing in the kitchen either. Maybe if it was the Sex Pistols...  SKINNY: Cornish Pasty is great lunch spot at best, but doesn't offer anything that will blow your socks off. Interesting food with decent taste. I'll probably be going back."}

We tried a few different ones and some we liked better than others.   They do have a decent beer list here.  As for the place itself, it was really dark inside and did not seem very clean. Black ceiling, black shades, low lighting. Also, the service was slow. I had ordered a beer and watched it sit up on the bar counter for a while before the server eventually brought it over.

VEGAN REVIEW:  Wandering into Cornish Pasty from the bright AZ sun is a shock for the senses. I was momentarily blinded, because of how dark and dimly lit the restaurant was. After taking a minute for my eyes to adjust, I saw a couple empty tables and two waitstaff. I did not know this was a seat yourself kind of deal so my brother and I just stood at the doorway and waited for instruction. After about 5 minutes or so, a waitress told us to seat ourselves.   We came around 2pm, so many of the vegan pasties had been sold out and I was left with the choice between the vindaloo and the greek flavored ones. Upon the waitress' recommendation, I went with the vindaloo. My brother and I also ordered the Oven-baked Chips to share.   The Vindaloo Pasty was spicy and filling, but probably not something I would order again. The vindaloo filling did not offer much excitement in the flavor department, and eating THAT much vindaloo filling was kind of monotonous. I really wish I came earlier so I could have more vegan options to chose from but my mistake is your benefit!   The pastry part of the pasty was delicious! It was crunchy and had a wonderful pastry flavor that is hard to describe. If they sold a pasty full of the pastry, I would buy that in a heartbeat! When comparing  my pasty to my brother's, I could tell they didn't glaze mine, which is a comforting to see because they probably used an egg wash.   The oven-baked chips were 10/10.They were crunchy, crispy, and satisfying. You can't go wrong with fresh baked fries/chips!  Overall, I would visit again (but earlier) to try more vegan pasties."}

Secondly, everything is overpriced by a dollar or two.  While I've had some bad service here, that doesn't factor into my rating. As long as you keep my beers coming and as long as my pasty is there, I'm good. Just never remove the lamb and mint pasty from the menu."}

I had the chicken tikka masala, which I expected to have more curry sauce but it was dry. The yogurt sauce complemented the pasty since it gave a cool taste to the dish. This pasty is worth a try if you are looking for something interesting.  My fiancee had the Oogie, which tasted dry and had scarce amount of steak chunks. If anything there were more potato chunks than steak chunks. The sauce that came with the Oogie did not taste good and made me want to throw up because it was a wine gravy sauce that tasted like expired sauce. I definitely do not recommend the Oogie.  Warning: The pasty takes about 15 minutes to order, so do not come here hungry and expect to get your pasty right away.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I want to give the Cornish Pasty Company another star, but I can't quite do it...  The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickey's Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid.  I tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the premium pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me.   Even that, I can write off to personal preference.  What really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself.   It's a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back.   On the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made.   I don't really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really don't need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i don't need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses).   My worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the kitchen area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites...  I've wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as it's ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back.  Maybe I'll just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden..."}

Let me start off by saying I really, really like the food and they have a great selection of beer. The problem was with a waitress (she's blonde and thin) and how she treated me during our last and final visit to this restaurant. During our meal, I asked for a recommendation for a beer and gave her characteristics of beer I like as well as a recommendation for a pasty (I am really not picky but I cannot handle a lot of spice). I ordered both things she recommended and both turned out to be really not what I wanted at all. She recommended a beer that was really hoppy (when I had told her I like pilsners) and a spicy indian pasty that had a lot of curry (I'm sure it would be great for people who can handle spicy food--just a reminder that my issue with this restaurant is not with the food). During our meal she was really inattentive and it took around 30 minutes to get our check after we had asked for it. Because my boyfriend owed me money from earlier that day, I tipped lower (around 12%) and he tipped higher (around 30%) so our average tip on our meal was OVER 20%. We decided to leave a good tip because, despite the poor service, he really enjoyed his meal and we have had good experiences there before.   This is where things get really, really bad.   After leaving, I realized I left something on our table and approached our waitress and she gave it to me. After I thanked her, she said thanks for the (expletive) bad tip. I could not believe that she cursed at me for a tip that was over 20% and I was completely dumbfounded. I tried to find the manager but was unable to. It's a real shame that she ruined my experience with Cornish Pasty. All of my friends I was with as well as others have vowed to not go back there."}

Overall the service was extremely slow and inconsiderate (I didn't really feel welcome), the vegan food wasn't vegan, and I still paid $15.00 for what amounted to a sandwich and fries. Maybe it was an off night, and I know a lone customer isn't a top priority, but I wouldn't come back again."}

Once I started getting ones that were a little icky, I just assumed they were having an off day.  I stopped going after my boyfriend and I got sick.  I really want to like this place, and I do like some things about it.  The crust on the pasties is always fab, but the fillings are hit or miss.  I always got either the Oggie or the Pilgrim, and the Oggie was more consitently good.  Once I tried the Pilgrim, it became my instant favorite since is had turkey and stuffing inside, and came with cranberry sauce for dipping.  But like I said, their lack of consistency, as well as the fact that I got sick last time I went, has made me not want to give them any more chances."}

The hubs and I went around nine on a weekend night and it was still busy and loud! My husband very much enjoyed his pasty as he loves cheese and bready foods, but I could've used some more freshness. The mustard sauce I ordered with my pasty was creamy but not right with my pasty so I switched with my husbands sweeter marinara to accompany my eggplant pasty. We sat outside and even though it was May they had the heaters on because it was chilly. Very considerate for us true Arizonans. I would like to go back to try their garlic mashed potatoes and Sheperd's Pie sometime in the future!"}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "The Cornish Pasty Company takes the idea of traditional miner food and gives it a modern face-lift. These glorified hot pockets (crispy, tender, flaky crust!) are filled with such nu-American classics as Pesto Chicken and mushrooms, steak and potatoes, and even the good ole' fashioned PB&J. Beer list is good and the wines and liquors are decent. This place gets pretty hoppin', but there isn't that long of a wait on busy nights. I love getting their roast potatoes on the side, and they are incredibly vegan/vegetarian friendly. However, no substitutions can be made as those are pre-made and frozen, which is part of why they only get 3 stars. The food is more of a 3.5, but their Tempe ASU clientele can be a little on the annoying/loud side, so I took off .5 stars for lack of atmosphere. This location is also quite small, but they do take-out and are open late."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I really just want to point out my experience to the managers, as I don't feel you deserve a bad review for this. But with two separate doors and a very unique layout you must know it's a confusing restaurant. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, however that should be a focus for your employees, realizing that every guest should be greeted and either told where to sit or to seat themselves. I awkwardly walked into BOTH entries and neither time did a single employee say hello or even look my way.   Forgot to mention that prior to arriving I called in to check that there wasn't a cover for the fight (most bars were charging if they had the fight on) and the girl that answered was extremely rude (customer service is SO SIMPLE... it pains me when employees are so bad at basic people skills)! It was hard to convince my boyfriend to even give it a shot after speaking to her.   So after this and the lack of acknowledgment when I walked in I couldn't do it. I left, and very disappointed because I truly wanted to give this place a shot. Maybe I'll attempt another location one day."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I want to give Cornish Pasty 4 stars, I really really do. The pasties themselves are delicious. It's been about two months since I went for the first time and I've been dreaming about them ever since.   When I went I ordered the Shepherd's Pie (Lamb, peas & carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheese with a side of gravy) and it was well worth the trip down to Tempe. The gravy was definitely necessary as without it, it would have been a bit dry. I tried to order the french fries and was told they didn't have any left, despite it being only 8pm on a Saturday night.   The reason for my star-stringiness has to do with the level of service. We had 4 people and when we walked in they were pretty busy. There was a table in the back that just needed to be cleaned off. A waitress came up and told us to wait there for a minute while she cleaned it off. About 30 seconds later a waiter came up and told us not to stand by the front and to go stand by the table. We walked back by the table and then got yelled at by the waitress for not listening to her. From that point on she seemed pretty pissed off at us. It was to the point that I felt uncomfortable even just asking her for a cup of water.   Despite the unfriendly server, I'll definitely go back for another tasty pasty!"}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Been to this location about 10-12 time, also been to the Mesa one 15-20 times.   Came to this location to tonight for the first time in probably a year or two and the service was so awful I felt the need to share.  I hate to do it, because the food really is good and they have a solid beer selection and decent prices, but this was the worst service I can remember in 15+ years of eating out.  Service here has never been great, but this was the worst I have seen it and compared to most other places around Tempe that have excellent service it was pretty abysmal.  It was only slightly busy when we got there, most tables were taken but usually only 1-2 people at a 4-8 person table.  We had a mediums sized group, 7 or 8, and were able to find a table outside.  Took probably 15-20 minutes before anyone came by.  The table hadn't been cleared from the people before us so fortunately there was already a beer menu there. Server did not clear or wipe down the table at all, just asked for our order. The menu has like 5-6 rotating beers, asked our server what they were. Rather than just tell us what the 5-6 were, he made us ask individually (they are categorized, seasonal,IPA, etc.).  He ended up having to list off almost all of them anyway (we ordered 3-4 of them), and this was the first indication that things would be difficult.    Drinks and food came out relatively quick.  No real issues here but only half of us were eating.  Server was not terrible friendly or helpful.  Acted annoyed when answering questions or having to wait at all.  Everything was bare minimum effort and it wasn't because it was busy.  The big problem came when the check came.  First, they pretty much ran us off.  No one asked for the check, it was 9:30 at a place that closes at 12, and the place was basically empty, but he just dumped the check without saying anything.  Put everything on one check, when the group was clearly individuals, and then pretty much refused to split it (3 different people asked).   Told us we could tell him amounts and he would charge them.   He had charged us for one item we ordered but they didn't have, I let him know and he said he would remove.  We do the math, give him cards and checks, and he brings it back.  Tells us pretty rudely we are $6-$7 short.  5 of that was his failure to remove the $5 item he billed us for and had just said he would remove.  I let him know that I am not happy that a) he billed us for an item we didn't get in the first place and b) had to ask him twice to remove.  Rather than just apologize, he gives me grief Whoa Buddy, nothing to get mad about.  At this point it had probably taken 15 minutes just to take care of the check and everyone at my table was pretty annoyed.  No one had ever had this much difficulty with a check and he honestly would have saved himself a lot of work and hassle had he just split it from the beginning and not fought us about it every step of the way.  Would generally recommend the Pasty, but will avoid this location like plague from now on.  Been coming here since the location was essentially a hallway, but will not anymore.  Head to the Mesa location instead."}

The service was superb so I tipped 37%, and while I ate I heard some great Johnny Cash, Waylon and Neil Young over the restaurant speakers.  I also heard a woman at a nearby table say, That is the most disgusting bathroom I've ever seen in a restaurant.  I wanted to just sip and chill for awhile after dinner, and I joked with two servers that they should now switch and play Led Zeppelin.  15 seconds later two things happened:  the country music playing was increased dramaticlly in volume (I was amused---did I do that?), and I now felt cold air conditioning blowing on the back of my neck (I was less amused since it was 10pm and prior to this the heat had been on all night since it is January).  I now had my hoodie on over my head as the AC poured down upon me for the next 30 minutes, then I exited, wondering which hamfisted manager makes such decisions, and why."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Started patronizing this Cornish Pasty location when they were just a hallway and a kitchen.   The place was awesome, with food you couldn't get anywhere else in town, and a great selection of craft beers.  It was fun to sit at the counter and watch them make the pastys.   I wish that I'd reviewed the place previously, as I would have given them 4 stars over probably a dozen previous visits but I wasn't really a Yelper then.      Now the place has expanded significantly, and it appears business volume has kept up with this expansion, which means they are almost certainly profitable.   And that's what makes my last visit so hard to understand.    First, our table in the back corner of the dining room -- the glass surface was broken from what was likely a few too many full plates and empty pints being forcefully put down on it, and it appeared as if many a beer had been spilled on that section of the table because the metal latticework under the cracked section of glass was a mysterious dull brown moldy/mildwey color for a good 2-3 to each side of the glass.  But the lights were dim and it didn't smell so we decided to ignore it.    Second, the men's room -- I stepped in here after we ordered but before our food was delivered.  This was one of the most disgusting restaurant men's rooms I've ever been in.  There was a lot of urine on the floor, broken tilework and molding everywhere. There were several paper towel dispensers, all of which were empty and appeared broken anyway, so I was forced to go find toilet paper to dry with after washing my hands.   All of the toilet paper rolls were sitting out on the back of the toilet or on top of what at one point had been a functioning tp dispenser.   To acquire some toilet paper meant picking the roll up off of a surface that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days or maybe weeks.  I wish I hadn't glanced at the toilet.  There are dive bars that don't even serve food with bathrooms that are 100x as clean as this one was.   Third, our food -- When I came out of the horribly filthy men's room, I should have immediately cancelled the food order and taken my family somewhere else for dinner.    That men's room was a sign.    My beer was not hot, but not cold, just cool.  It should have been a lot colder.  The three of us all ordered different pastys, mine was the Royale with Cheese, and we all felt sick late that night and into the next day.  If just one of us had felt sick, chalk it up to something else, but Cornish Pasty was the common denominator.    Finally, our service -- Our server was actually great.   She was prompt, checked up on us frequently, and got our orders exactly right.  She did a fine job, and the other stuff we experienced was not her fault.  I tipped her out well.  What I noticed though, was that while the place was slammed, other employees were, at times, inexplicably wandering around the restaurant with their phones held out in front of them, distracted, not paying attention to what was going on around them.   Not sorry to be an ass here - you're at work.   Snapchat your friends and Pokemon Go ANY OTHER TIME except for right now.      I don't care how slammed you are, how unique your food is, how close you are to the largest university in the nation or how many times I've been there in the past and been happy.  You can't manage a restaurant this way, there's absolutely no excuse for it.   If this place were to have received a health code inspection the night I took my wife and 17 yr old daughter there for dinner, I have no doubt they would have failed.   This is management's responsibility and ownership should hold them accountable."}

I decided my friend and I would meet up here for drinks. On this particular night the resturant was packed, like usual. My friend and I saw two open seats at the bar and sat down. About 10 minutes later the waitress told us she would be with us shortly.   When we hit the 30 minute mark, I was nothing but enraged at the terrible customer service. I told my friend that I wanted to go somewhere else. As I was getting up and gathering my purse, the waitress comes over and had the balls to tell us she was just about to take our order. I informed her that we were leaving because she took 30 minutes to get to us. She should have just let us leave and not say anything. The fact she even acknowledged she was a crappy waitress enraged me more.  So why the three stars? When you're not waiting FOREVER for service and you actually get the opportunity to eat their pasties, your mind will be blown! The food is delicious! The only downside is you don't want to show up at ANY Cornish starving because it takes them a little while to cook them bad boys. I assure you that you won't regret the wait though!"}

There's either a long, dark strip of bar seats or a regular table area, cut off by the bar. They had quite a selection of pasties, but I went with the English Breakfast. It was quite the sweet and savory combo. The dough itself held everything well and it had a nice, flaky texture. The ingredients were OK, but it lacked any robust flavor. I dont know if this is staying true to the British cuisine or what, but everything was a bit mild in flavor. I was also taken back by how big these things were. They truly are the size of a calzone rather than an empanada. Service sucks here, but at the same time, it kinda fits the vibe. Lots of college kids, overworked and understaffed.

I was glad to see that the restaurant is doing well and remodeled their two locations with more locations coming soon.   The food at Cornish Pasty is impeccable. I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet.   The atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place. It's good for dates as well. $5 mid shelf and always $3 Irish Car bombs with lots of microbrews on draft? YES PLEASE.   The one thing I hate about Cornish Pasty, and the reason why I give it 2/5 is the SERVICE SUCKS. It must be a requirement to be a hipster with 5+ visible tattoos/piercings with a poor work effort. You even get a raise for having poor personal hygiene! I've been eating at Cornish Pasty for 5 years and have never received good service. Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.  If you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch."}

I asked about the vegan choices (supposed to be at least 4 each day).  For whatever reason there were none.  So I ordered the Pilgrim pasty (roast turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing).  I ate the pasty, picked out the sweet potato bits and left the meat because the turkey didn't even smell good.  One of my guests ordered the Royale with cheese but asked that the button mushrooms be left out.  That can't be done.  I guess the ingredients are pre-mixed which is unfortunate as none of us care for fungus.  We ordered the bread and butter pudding for dessert.  But there was no bread and butter pudding available so instead we shared a piece of banana caramel something, and ordered coffee.  Except...there was no coffee.  That was just the end.  How does a restaurant not have coffee???  Considering they had pretty much none of what we really wanted, the whole meal was a huge letdown.  Why didn't the server know in advance what wasn't available instead of telling us after we'd made up our minds?  Did the server tip the manager off to the fact that we weren't happy?  Apparently not, as no one stopped by to chat with us.  Will I be back?  No."}

First, I ordered a frozen strawberry Margarita - I sent it back because there was barely a strawberry taste.  I then ordered the Back Porch Strawberry Lemonade.  They need to add more strawberries to their strawberry drinks.  Next, came the biscuits with apple butter - great but it is not your traditional southern apple butter.  I had the 7oz brisket - it was served in one inch rectangles and not slices.  It was good but it still had fat.  It was easy to remove.  However, I could not taste the smoke.  Maybe it should be smoked much longer than other other places.  On the table there are three types of sauces - Memphis, original, and hot & spicy.

Fridays & Saturdays there are just way too many people. I usually order whatever's on special, most of the times when I go it happens to be Kilt Lifter. Good beer. Service is not so great, never has been for me. Even dining there (inside) wasnt outstanding service. Although, the food was good. I cant remember what I even had since I rarely order food there. Try to go upstairs, I did once and no one was up there.. it was kind of creepy. Not too sure of the whole haunted thing, but it adds to the bar's charm.  I do like this bar, a lot of my friends are regulars and mostly can be found there on any given day. I do like the type of crowd that goes to Casey's, at least on the nights I've been. The place would be a hell of a lot better if they somehow found a way to expand because I literally get claustrophobic on the busier nights. In an bar thats outdoors that just seems odd. lol. Also, the parking situation sucks.. the ratio of parking spots to bar goers is not proportionate.   Overall, I'm sure I'll be back many a time, since its a cool place to just hang out with your friends at."}

Personally, I'm not a fan of the raw oyster's but I love their rendition of Oyster's Rockafeller. I think there lunch specials are also another bright spot of this establishment. If you add them on their facebook, they sometimes post their specials.  Aside from their food, their drink selection is rather simple. They don't really offer anything that I can't get anywhere else. The happy hour is not really mind-blowing either. I think a dollar off drafts and specials on wells if I remember correctly.  Really, what you are paying for is the ambiance. I get that it's historic and it's got an irish pub type theme, but I didn't really think it was anything special.  Oh, I forgot to mention, if you do decide you visit (and if you are male) if you have to use the blarney stone restroom on the outside patio. It's basically a simulated rock fountain that you pee on. Now that I think about it, I guess it sounds more fun after a few pints..."}

Pretty poor service, in fact, some of the worst I've had. It was like we weren't even there at all. We ordered drinks and it was like automatic confusion. The server who we ordered them from left and never brought them but 10 minutes later someone else asked us if we wanted drinks so we reordered and they came in another 5 minutes. Then after awhile, another person took our order and I ordered a salad 1st and specifically asked for it 1st and it never came. When our meals came, I told the 4th person we spoke to to cancel my salad. My friend ordered the corn and asked for extra butter for it. It never came so we stopped a server (#5) and asked for melted butter. He said no problem! But....never returned. We flagged down a female manager who apologized and went to get it. By the time my friend got butter, the corn was cold. We were there for approximately 1hr and 30 min and I got burnt ends and iced t and my friend got a tri tip sandwich and an iced t. Simply ridiculous. Never was asked about appetizers, never asked if we wanted dessert and never were we checked on during the meal.

Somehow, with the disgusting 2-stall girls' restroom, no parking, high bar prices, no good waitresses, and pint-only beer options, this place maintains it's hipster popularity as the place to be in downtown Tempe.   I honestly do not know why I go, but I say yes when my friends decide to invite me here. The only reason why I give it two stars is because of the ability to be a hot spot when everything on Mill is dying. This is due to sheer lack-of-caring about their customers, which college attendees and awkward single older men inside seem to be drawn to.   Last time, the lack of caring was what threw me over the edge. I was waiting at the bar and I was almost next! So excited to finally pay over $4 for a pint of beer (which was their happy hour special), when a guy moved to the right of me and started up a conversation with the bartender. He obviously knew him, and the conversation continued, without the bartender helping anyone, for at least 4-5 minutes. I finally said to a waitress, Can I get a drink or is this bartender just going to ignore me? She replied, Oh, these guys can talk all night. That's just how our bartenders are!  You'd think by how much money Casey's is making, they'd improve their restrooms. One girls' restroom with only two toilets for a packed-bar is just unsanitary at the end of most nights.    My husband says the oysters are good and fresh, but that's no reason to go back for us.

There was more corn and potatoes than there was beef. There's no beef shortage that I'm aware of, and this wasn't Kobe beef, so I have to question.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "My visit was less than spectacular... I'm evaluating 3 main points: Food, Location/ambiance, and service...  1.This is supposed to be THE place to go for oysters, fish, drinks, etc. The food was NOT impressive. Everything lacked flavor and at the same time everything tasted the same. no distinctive flavors. The fish didn't taste like fish, the fries didn't taste like fries, etc... I went simple thinking i'd better try something safe so I had the Fish & chips platter. the fish was mediocre... the batter was thin, not crispy at all. It had no salt, flavor, or seasoning whatsoever. I've actually had better fried fish @ Mimi's Cafe and Tom's BBQ, neither of which specialize in fish and it was 1000 times better. The side dishes were met with the same lack of seasoning. The fries were limp and had absolutely no salt. The coleslaw was dry, had no flavor and was hard for me to even get through one single bite.  2. I was NOT impressed at all with the property or location. The property is just ok.  The only reason it's a big deal is because it is a historic house in the downtown Tempe area that has been converted into a bar/restaurant. It just has lots of busy posters, lights,and all the groovy stuff bars normally have. Nothing out of the ordinary... Location - It's not in the heart of Tempe at all..., it's in a neighborhood just around the corner from the heart of Tempe. Like I mentioned before. It's a converted house, therefore as you can imagine, it is in a residential neighborhood. They have a patio, which is pretty much unbearable to sit out there 9 out of 12 months during the year, and the inside is small, dark and cramped. There isn't much to see outside anyway other than hippies, skateboarders and homeless people coming out of the alley way behind the circle K up the street.  3. The service is not spectacular either. I walked in and was greeted by NO ONE. Since the patio is the first thing you walk in to, you have no idea where to go when you're there! There are people sitting and drinking & eating all around, but no greeter, server or anyone to seat you are even tell you where to go. I did what seemed logical and walked IN to the actual house and you run right into the bar. The bartender pretty much just looked at me and said grab a menu and sit anywhere... WOW! It took about 5 minutes for a server to even notice I was there waiting to be attended to.  This was my first visit and needless to say my LAST!!!!"}

Although we had some nice appetizers (pretzels with spicy cheese sauce were great, as was the Thai hummus and pita bread), but the pizzas we ordered were terrible. We ordered the margarita and the Italian.  The margarita had too much garlic powder, and the Italian tomato sauce was much too sweet and overpowered the toppings.

It's sorta neat to walk in through the back door past all the tanks and whatnot. In the summer, it's also a nice and chilly way to cool off. Beyond that, it's probably only barely worth it. I've found the service to be unpredictable... usually not good. It's probably a bad idea to take a date here unless you're in college.   When my friends suggest going here, I usually suggest someplace else - not sure exactly why. There's just something about it that doesn't lend itself to an easy dining and drinking experience... it's complicated somehow. It's odd that a place you can wear flip flops to could feel complicated, but it is. Maybe it's that tiny bit of 'factory' vibe the building gives off. It's like we're visiting the building while it's working and we're not entirely welcome there, but it's just too polite to tell us to leave."}

He was friendly and I could tell that he had a lot of pride in the Four Peaks Brewery which is a positive thing and it says a lot about the company. I'm not usually a huge fan of beer so I wasn't able to enjoy the brews as much as others, but my favorite was the peach ale beer.   I think a way that the tours can improve is if they give those who are doing the tour a designated area where we can sit down, relax, and enjoy our beers after the tour is over. After the tour was over, I didn't like how we had to go back to the front of the restaurant and wait for a table.. It was extremely crowded so we had to fight for a small spot at the bar before waiting 20 minutes to be seated with the rest of my group. We all ordered the beer flights which used up all the two drink tickets per person that they gave us for the tour. The beer flight is a good idea because of the variety.   Their beer battered fries were EXCELLENT! My friends and I couldn't stop talking about how delicious and crispy they were.. I think i enjoyed the fries even more than the beer... haha."}

But I had always chalked that up as one of those service industry niceties.   Unfortunately stars aligned and I found myself in a shouting match with a doorman.  From what I know about doormen you want one thing. A guy who loses his temper and sends rational thought to the wind. Rather than refusing me service upon inspection of my perfectly valid drivers license with which I have been out happily drinking for 4 years and sending me on my merry way, my ID was held as a sort of ransom. Minutes flew as we argued there street-side. I  jumped through so many hoops trying to get my ID back I could have won a ribbon at the Eukenuba dog show. I recited my birthday, over and over. Yes maybe the tenth time I will slip. Or maybe I want my ID back to leave. I recited it so many times everyone in line knew my date of birth. I wrote down my address, phone number, date of birth. Still he was unsatisfied.   It seemed to sink in that I was who I claimed when my accompanying party was able to tell him my address and my birthday. But this only further raised his suspicions. He stumbled on a thought of pure cunning, like Archimedes shouting in the street naked proclaiming his epiphany.  Why would they all know where he lives?  Yes, very fishy. By now it was clear. He believed it was an elaborate ruse. For what though? To infiltrate the mecca of gentrification? Or just to get a couple beers? And yes whenever I go out I make sure everyone know my address it's the only way I can get into any overrated restaurant.  It was easier to get through TSA when I came back from Mogadishu with a suitcase full of Qurans.   By now he is flustered. He calls out again.   You didn't exactly make my job easier.  Yes, that is the role of a customer at a business that is in the service industry after all. Maybe I will wash dishes after I am done to save everyone from doing their job.  It took a manager to pry the ID from him and finally the refusal of service came. It was sort of like when you know someone is going to dump you so you spring into action to dump them first.   The second star goes to the only thing they are able to get right. The beer."}

We had a large party, and the person organizing our get-together tried to call an hour before we arrived to put our name on the list, but no one answered the phone after repeated attempts.  So, when we got here we waited for a bit outside while some tables cleared out.  When we finally got a table, they gave us a table that couldn't seat all of us, for they wrote down the wrong number of people for our party.    After some more shuffling and rearranging of chairs and tables, we finally got seated.  I tried a sample of the pumpkin porter, and had the portabella-veggie beer bread.  The pumpkin porter was decent, and had a nice pumpkin-spice taste to it.  I wasn't a big fan of the veggie beer bread.  I was expecting more of a loaf-type bread instead of the flatbread that actually came out.  As a result, the dish was more of a wrap than a sandwich.  The interior of the wrap was filled with lots of fresh veggies, but I was hoping to find more portabella mushroom in it.  In addition, the veggies themselves were bland, and so overwhelmingly garlicky that I felt like I could ward vampires away for a mile with my breath.    Despite having a large party, service, once we were seated, was good.  The waitress had no problem splitting our checks, and she refilled our drinks promptly as needed.  Another thing to note is that there isn't any A/C in the building, just overhead fans, so if you come on a hot day you might be sweating a bit!"}

The place was quite empty, but we visited on a Wednesday night so that was expected.  The food was okay. Oysters were fresh but the flavor was a bit off. One of the oysters in our plate was spoiled and that ruined the plate for us. Luckily, the waiters were glad to replace it for us. The fried bar food selection includes fried mushrooms, fried oysters, and fish n chips, among others.  None of the plates were remarkable, except for the Oyster Rockefeller, which I highly recommend.  Wide selection of local beers on tap.

One of their bouncers, who refers to himself as G, decided that it would be completely acceptable to let some transphobic words escape his mouth.  Now, in no way am I a transgender individual, but I do have much respect for the trans community and I can't believe this place would keep this dude around.    So, my girlfriend had to use the restroom and there was a huge line, so she peeked around to see if there was the same traffic jam by the guys bathroom and this dude just comes at her all aggressive like telling her she needed to get away and all that...which she was quick to move and apologize.  But then she asked him, What if I was a transgender person? To which this guy replied Well then you can get out.  Really dude?  So, she informs the manager of this and he was on her side for sure.  The bouncer then began harassing her again and was trying to kick her out of the bar (for what?! Right...he didn't say) and she called to the manager that he was still being aggressive with her.  The three of them went to have a talk and the bouncer was trying to say that she called him the N word...UM MY GIRLFRIEND IS BLACK TOO JACKASS!  She never uses that word and would NEVER call someone that because she actually is a respectable person and isn't ignorant.  Did the manager say anything to the bouncer about his transphobic comment??  Did he?! NO!! I later called to ask what the manager's name was, and found out that not only is Gavin a manager but he's also part owner...you've got to be kidding me.  It's a real shame when you let your employee harass a guest who didn't do anything but try to go pee.  Yelp folk, whether you're gay, straight, bi, queer, trans, a straight ally or something of the like, I strongly urge you to steer clear of this establishment and spend your money where this kind of behavior is not tolerated."}

For months I had been looking forward to dining at this place, since laying eyes on an invitation to take place here. So, needless to say, after a doctor's appointment located a few blocks away, I jumped on the opportunity to eat some Oysters Rockafeller.  When I arrived, I thought the outer appearance of the establishment was quaint, quirky and certainly unique. The casual vibe screams out to you, as if anything other than flip flops and a tan are overdressing.   Once I opened the doors, I found the inside to be completely dark and drab.... sort of like Cheers Neighborhood Bar's illegitimate cousin. The bartender looked up but failed to greet us because his current conversation was more important. We then seated ourselves and the hostess came by 2 minutes later only to say You need some menus or something? We of course said yes and she proceeded to retrieve them.   The waiter was prompt and pretty pleasant. I was a little disappointed that after we ordered our drinks and food, we found out that happy hour was in a couple minutes. That would have been nice to know!   I will say that we were thoroughly entertained by the patrons of the pub as we waited for our food. The bartender drank while on the clock and one guy continued to throw the F bomb and other four letter words. And to my surprise he let us know that women have vaginas and that he is currently receiving government cheese. I'm not sure why we all needed the lesson in anatomy and economics however, I didn't know whether to laugh or smack him.... lucky for him I didn't choose the latter.   My husband's food was delivered to the table 10 minutes before mine which in and of itself was rude. However, this is not the final straw for me.   THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE I must say I was reluctant to use the restroom and for good reason. On my way to the restroom in the hallway was a pungent foul order which I assumed came from the men's room because 9 times out of 10, that is the case. When I opened the door to the ladies room I found the culprit. Naturally, I thought someone had let it fly in there, sadly I was sort of right. One stall had toilet paper all over the floor and seat so I went to the other and the sight will FOREVER haunt me. The toilet was not only filled with poo but some was smeared on the front. There is no way that all of that came from one person and if the regular culprit felt it was not necessary to flush, why should I for them? I held my water, washed my hands for fear of catching anything by way of touching knobs and hurried out of there only to find my Oysters Rockerfeller waiting for me at the table.... as if I wanted to eat after that site.   The only reason this place even gets one star is because the waiter comped a beer from our tab... I think he felt bad for us. LOL   My husband and I vowed to never return and I think I will take the advice of a previous commenter, Mark S. and try the House of Tricks down the road. So long Casey Moore's."}

And he was one of those type of waiters who was there every 5 minutes at the start of the meal, and no where near at the end of the meal.  We started our meal with their signature biscuits.  We are in AZ so I am sure the cooks do not really now how to cook a good biscuit.  Our nice flakey biscuit was hard and crunchy on the outside, and warm and not flakey on the inside.  The honey butter was marginal.  The onion straw appetizer was good, the best part of the meal.  I had a baby back rib combo with hot links and my friend had the chicken and rib lunch combo.  Same kind of ribs.  The ribs were dry and not very tender.  She said her chicken was good, and my sausage was cooked fine.  No real flavor to the sausage, just spicy.

We're in Tempe... a land-locked state, correct? Oysters? At an Irish pub? Really? Like I said, confusing!"}

I asked for the gravy on the side. When they brought it to the table, I could tell it was not going to be great. The gravy was extremely thick, like custard. I put a spoonful on top of my turkey, and it sat there in a lump on top of it. I tried to spread it around on top, and gave up.  The turkey was room temperature, on top of a slice of plain white bread and a large pile of stuffing. It looked like it was all dried out, and I could hardly swallow it. The potatoes had a lot of garlic in them, and that didn't go very well with the stuffing. I asked if I could try a different gravy. They brought a brown gravy, and it had some kind of herb in it. It tasted terrible to me.  I have a rule that I only order what the restaurant is famous for. I should have ordered BBQ."}

The food is great, especially when you're comparing it to other bars.  The food is prepared like the food is Four Peaks' specialty, which is impressive for a brewery.  The beer is good for a local brewery.   I hate that every time I've gone to Four Peaks, I've had to wait, wait, wait for a table.  Four Peaks doesn't have a host or hostess who is handling seating so you're completely on your own.  I suppose if you go at at time that the place isn't completely packed, it's a decent system.    Every evening I've gone, I've found myself frustrated that I couldn't get a seat or practically had to start a fist-fight to get one.  I'm not even 5' tall so fighting isn't usually a good idea for me.  The reality is that my friends and I find ourselves standing, typically in a walkway where we have to dodge the waitstaff, watching for a table to open up.  On a Friday night after a long day at work, it's simply too much work to try and get a table.  I'd rather visit a hole in the wall bar where I can find a seat without work or a restaurant with an actual seating system."}

When we got the bill to sign, we realized he did not apply the full $100 in cash that we gave along with the credit card.  When we questioned the waiter, he got very defensive and pulled $40 out of his POCKET and said we only gave $40.  WTH? Why is it in his pocket and not the register??  We were adamant that we gave $100, he went inside and came back 10 min later with his Manager and apologized for the mix up.  The waiter said someone found it on the floor, while the Mgr said another waiter found it in the bill folder.  So which is it?  We thought we had the bill squared away until we checked our credit card online and we were charged the full amount 2x and now they won't provide a credit.

Crispy and breaded on the outside, but when you bit into them they turned to mush.  I'd come back for the beer, the interesting crowd, the great outdoor patio or rustic bar interior.

One of our group had his wallet stolen the day before and had planned to just have dinner with us we put in our name for dinner and were told that we would need to  show our ID's just to have dinner. That kind of took us back because we thought we were going to a restaurant anyhow that was a problem because as mentioned above one of our group did not have a wallet or ID either way if that is the rule I understand but what really upset us was how rude the security guard was and also that we saw at least 15 kids and teenagers sitting there eating food with their groups if it is a bar before a restaurant and you can't have anyone under 21 there then so be it but the fact that the same rules don't apply for everyone was the problem. The security guard could have simply said let me get the manager for you and see if they can do anything I'm sorry for the inconvenience etc but the answer was no you can't come in have a nice night that's it. Turned out it was the best thing that could happen to us because we ended up at the Pig and Pickle and it was one of the best meals I  have ever had and the service was amazing.

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I would not ever, ever, ever go here again if it weren't for the fact that my group of friends practically lives here. I really don't know what they see in the place other than hey we've been going here every week for the better part of 10 years now...why would we do anything else?  Pros: It's uh. It's a bar? With an outdoor bathroom that lets you pee on the wall? I dunno. I digress. There are some good parts.  1. Management and Bartenders: Awesome folks. Very personable. If you have any issue with the place at all, the manager will do his best to make sure you're happy, even if there's not much he can do.   2. Aside from the people who drink here(which I'll touch on below), the actual physical atmosphere is nice. I like patio bars.  Cons:  1. Door staff are assholes. This is the first place I've ever had a security person anywhere ever lay their hands on me. I walked out the side entrance to make a phone call in a quieter area and told the guy I'd be right back in. Finished my very short phone call within eyesight of the guy making eye contact with him a few times during the call. I walked back into the bar past him. He followed me 50 feet into the bar and grabbed me by the back of my neck and started screaming at me about showing ID every time you walk into the place. I literally talked to the guy not 5 minutes before in order to avoid having to go through the ID process all over again. If it ever happens again I'm calling the police and filing a battery charge.   2. Food is garbage. With the exception of the potato skins, everything on the menu sucks. But it's REALLY hard to make lousy potato skins.  3. Beer menu is small/not really listed anywhere. Ask the waitress which beers they have and she'll tell you a few random ones that she can think of off of the top of her head and say and we have others I guess. If you want Kiltlifter or Fat Tire, you're set. If you want anything else, it's a 50/50 shot on whether or not they have it.  4. Hipster. Central. Seriously the clientele here is atrocious. I've literally been verbally assaulted here for eating potato skins by a waifish, meth-mouthed denizen who was the human embodiment of the lyrics of Macklemore's Thrift Shop because there was cheese and bacon on my food. He went off on me for being offensive to animals or some such. Telling me I would be a vegetarian if I had to kill the animal myself. On a friday night, the place is packed wall-to-wall with the whiniest, heroin-chic douchebags you will ever meet. I feel like this is the case because they don't like the loud music of the bars on mill so they walk around the corner and park themselves at Casey's.  5. Cops. Lots and lots and lots of cops. If you go here on a semi-regular basis(once or twice a month or more) for a long enough period of time, you WILL be stopped immediately after leaving the bar. The Tempe PD are for the most part nice folks, but the ones who patrol looking to catch a DUI coming out of Casey's are all assholes. Not really the bar's fault at all, but it's part of the experience of going there.  6. Pricing. Two drinks and a plate of aforementioned potato skins? 20 dollars plus tip. Look to spend at least 5 dollars(tip included) for a pint of beer here unless it's on special/happy hour. 7 to 10 dollars for a mixed drink with well liquor(tip included).   7. Parking. 10-15 parking spots in their lot. Yeah. 10 to 15 spots. For a bar that is usually packed to the brim with people. After the stores close down, you can park in the little strip mall parking lot around the corner. But again, there's always a cop car or motorcycle cop just sitting in that lot waiting for you to look like you're walking toward a car.   8. Wait staff sucks. It's always sucked. It's not really their attitude all the time(though it is sometimes). They hire like 3 or 4 girls(I'm not being sexist, they only hire females to do wait staff) to cover what's usually close to 1,000 people(maybe more? I'm not a good judge of actual numbers of people) all asking for booze at the same time. Don't even bother placing drink orders with them. Just walk up to the bar and pay with cash and then go back to your seat.    9. Bathrooms are horrendous. It's really hard to use the bathroom when there are 2 urinals and one stall for guys. Especially once 10pm rolls around and the holocaust-skinny hipster kids I mentioned above start vomiting in the stall and sink because they can't hold their booze and drinking in a college town means DRINK UNTIL YOU DIE. The blarney stone is all well and good until a dude takes a dump in there.   10. Climate control. Because of the patio setup, it's always too hot or too cold to be really comfortable, save for the few months per year here in the valley that the weather is really nice. It's still 90+ degrees at 11pm here 6 months out of the year.   If you haven't been here? Don't bother going. You'll get suckered into meeting your friends for drinks for the next 6 years."}

It has been several months since I left New England and Casey Moore's is my first venture out for seafood, albeit with diminished expectations.  That being said, my Fish & Chips ($11.00, Cod, not the Haddock overhanging the plate I had grown accustomed to) was pretty good.  The fish was lightly battered and done just right-moist, tender, soft and juicy.  The chips were skin -on fries.  My wife had Salmon Oscar.  The salmon was slightly overdone, and the crab and hollandaise sauce was a little too fishy.  She ordered a double cooked baked potato that looked and tasted exactly like the prefab twice baked potato's that came with some Omaha Steaks I received from my boss last Christmas.  There were also slices of zucchini and yellow squash which were sauteed with mild seasoning.  The waitress was outstanding and gave us unbiased recommendations such as: I would stay away from the Surf & Turf.  We just don't go through enough lobster and the kitchen doesn't always do a great job with it.  It gets sent back sometimes.  Good to know.

Also we are in the industry and we sell many Four peaks beers so agreed it was a good lunch spot to check out. My friend, my two boys and I walked up to the hostess stand that had about six staff members standing there...little awkward and only one said hello. We asked to sit on the patio and one girl said only inside is available. As we followed the speedy hostess back we noticed three open tables on the patio...we got sat in the furthest darkest table in a corner..no, seriously in a corner under some dart boards. I'm assuming the six open tables we passed inside were not available either? My friend stops the hostess before she walks away and asks about the open tables we saw on the patio. She stutters and replies that they have to keep with the server rotation and it is not that servers turn to be sat. So your telling us you have a server that cant handle being double sat?  Our server comes and we ask her (not willing to let it go yet)...can we sit on the patio..we saw several open tables and this is quite the dark corner. She looked at us irritated herself and said ill check and walks away. She returns quickly and replies the patio is a 20 minute wait and the tables available cannot sit the amount of people we have. (So you cannot pull up a chair to an outside table exactly how you did to this table we were sat at?) We would have to put two together she says. My friend and I decided to quit trying to argue our point and just order. We asked for the specials sheet...twice. She orders an 8th street...yum. Love love  Four Peaks beer. We split a nacho and a sandwich off the crinkled up specials sheet. Kids got chicken fingers and loved them.  Food was really good...and quick. Bottom line, I take my kids everywhere to eat. There freakishly well behaved and I being in the industry for too long now love taking them to experience food and atmosphere of all kinds.

I've only been here on weekends, and it's especially hard to get seats when ASU is in session.  Parking also can be difficult.  The food has always been OK.  They do have non-seafood items for people like me.  Service can be spotty.  My last visit, however, really changed my perspective on this place.  I would have rated this place 3 stars, but they failed in a couple of key areas.  It took over one and a half HOURS for us to get our entrees.  We did get appetizers and soup/salad for those who ordered them, but the gap between those and the entrees was noticeably long.  I understood that since we were a somewhat large party that it may take longer but still, that long?  I was starting to wonder if they just wanted us to keep the alcohol flowing and that we wouldn't notice how long the actual food took.  When I finally got my turkey croissant sandwich, there was very little turkey, as in 2 thin slices, and I couldn't detect the avocado, lettuce, or tomato.  I could definitely taste the bacon, though, since there seemed to be more bacon than anything else.  The balance of the whole sandwich was lost.  Everyone else was happy with their food.  At least the servers acknowledged at the end that it took a while and comped a few items.  Since it was a large party, they included the 18% tip in the bill despite the somewhat crappy service.  Since people were more interested in the movie afterwards, I wasn't going to contest that.  I'll reluctantly come here again which is why I rate it two stars.  Luckily, this isn't a place near the top of my friends' go-to list.  And I will try to talk people out of this place if it comes up."}

Our waitress was monotone when talking to us, she asked us if we had been there before and said welcome back so depressing. When we had questions about the menu answers were short and the service, especially when most people are in a hurry at lunch time, it was really slow here so it prevented us from wanting to get items we would have normally ordered or wanted to. I just ended up getting the spinach dip and it was swimming in oil. Tried pouring some out but it kept accumulating, I could t even finish it and my fingers felt so greasy after every chip. Love their apple butter, sweet tea, and beef ribs and generally having dinner here goes well, service has always been pretty slow since I first came here, still is, but lunch the other day they were not at their best all the way around, more disappointed in the food quality than anything."}

I like that they had the spears over the chips. The fried shrimp appetizer was good and had decent size shrimp. My friend had the lunch combo with a beef rib and chicken. He was very disappointed that the rib was the size of Tyrannosaurus Rex but had the amount of meat as a squirrel leg. He was expecting a meaty rib considering the price of the lunch entree. We sat in the bar area. Our service was below average. We waited to be acknowledged. We waited for our order to be taken. We waited for our drinks to be delivered. We never got checked on after our meal was served. Our drinks were not replenished. And waited even longer for our check to come. A $50.00+ lunch for two was not enjoyable."}

We ate at Lucille's last week for a late dinner, and everything tasted good, however, my 2 year old ended up with a slight case of food poisoning. She was up the entire night throwing up after we got home from dinner. I had found 2 hairs (after finding the 2nd hair UNDER my food, I came to the conclusion that they were not mine) on my plate and within my burger. I was only a two bites away from finishing my food when I made the realization that the hairs did not belong to me so I was mostly embarrassed that I ate the whole thing, luckily, I did not end up sick like my daughter. It seems that their kitchen may not be managed very well, or maybe it's just that it was 9pm and they didn't care. We had to take to my toddler to urgent care because she threw up well into the next day. So of course, there were co-pay fees and prescriptions we had to pay for. I wrote to Lucille's that very same day that we took her to urgent care which was 12/14 and still have not received any sort of acknowledgement from them. Also, I posted on their Facebook page and the same thing, no response. I guess it's the same upkeep of their kitchen, THEY DON'T CARE!"}

There was not a salad that was not drenched in fat, bacon, eggs, cheese etc.  That being said, I realize this is a barbecue joint so if you're in the mood for barbecue they have tons of it! I had a team of barbecue lovers with me, and they were very pleased with the tri-tips and said they were amazing. Happy hour prices are really good.

We went for lunch on a Saturday only to find that you CAN'T get lunch on a Saturday, only dinner. We were interested in a sampler platter. They are almost double the lunch price on the dinner menu. When I asked the waitress about the lunch menu she said not on the weekend. I told her that I didn't plan on spending $30 for a lunch plate and she just shrugged her shoulders and smiled - very rude. The biscuits she brought were hard. We switched to sandwiches due to the high cost of things on the dinner menu. The bun was very thick and hard and I kept tearing pieces off to avoid a mouth full of bread. The cole slaw was very dry and had no flavor at all. My husband said the BBQ beans were very spicy and he likes spicy food so they must've been really spicy. Also there were only 3 types of BBQ sauces to choose from. Most BBQ paces have a greater variety of sauces. Overall the place did NOT live up to its smell. I don't understand all the people waiting to get in there. I suggest Honey Bears BBQ. It's not far away, has zero atmosphere but GREAT BBQ at a reasonable price."}

There was simply no way I was going to finish, and since I was planning to walk around the Marketplace afterwords - I knew the food wouldn't keep.  -- Extreme Prices.  We dropped in with the kids, because we thought it would be family friendly and moderately priced.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu.  All the entree's were $20+  Even kids meals were $8 dollars... better mortgage the house if you want to get drinks too!  -- Better Options.  Yes, this place is great.

Yea, I know its in Tempe, but after some ten years of higher education, there are times I'd love to go get a good local brew and a good burger without having to deal with the local brain trust at ASU.  Again, I know its Tempe. But sometimes I'd rather the little bastards went somewhere else.  We went on Saturday night (again, I know, Saturday in Tempe) and there was a half hour wait to get a table for two. This was largely due to the number of quasi-hipsters, dudes with beards way too industrial for an AZ summer, and the obligatory drunken college girls who wouldn't leave. Maybe Four Peaks needs to think about how to manage diners and drinkers in separate ways.   I'll go back, because I'm not that smart and I like abuse. My inner masochist loves the burgers and pitchers, they make me happy.

The food, while a bit on the pricey side for what it is, is pretty damn good.  The portions are HUGE.  The BBQ sandwich was about the best I've had west of the Mississippi. It was as close to an Eastern Carolina BBQ as any place has come, which is saying a lot.  They do BBQ right.  My bf ordered chicken and biscuits and was also impressed.    Overall, pretty good.

I did like that they always have all Four Peaks beers available, including the Peach Ale, my favorite. I ordered the chicken in beer bread. I specifically asked for no mushroom, and the server double checked right after I said it, so I know he heard me, but the food I received had mushroom in it. Not only that, when I was eating the leftovers at home, I bit down on something that was unchewable--turned out to be an entire edamame pod. Maybe somebody's appetizer was being prepared next to my chicken and it got mixed in? Tasty food, but still disappointing. The people I was with loved the banh mi and salmon sandwich, though.

With Tempe's abundance of late night dining establishments, the competition is pretty fierce!  Four Peaks gets high marks with me for it's variety of bar fare but most of all for it's delicious Fish & Chips and Blue Cheese Burger.  There fries are fab!  The patio is nice too, when the AZ weather permits it is hard to find a table out there!  I struggle not to give them four stars for these items but I have to consider the ambiance and the brew also.  For me the ambiance would be cool because I love the vintage industrial feel of the old railroad location, but then there is the standard ASU crowd, bright lighting and the standard KUPD or KDKB type music that is a buzz kill for me.  The brew offerings are award-winning according to their menu but to me the flavors are mediocre, the options are somewhat limited and they don't seem to add many new options often enough.  All of these things are matters of personal taste and do not reflect the quality of their food by any means, that being said, Four Peaks is a great place to start your night or finish it, especially if you like the college bar scene!  If you are looking for a unique dive with an unusual crowd then this place may seem a little bland, but the fish & chips will not disappoint!"}

We had a very large group so I am also posting the review for my meat eating friends also because there weren't many veggie options available besides sides.  My favorite thing here were the biscuits.  They were addictive! The Dixie Sweet Tea was good!  I did not like the Flame Roasted Artichoke app.  It was really dry and had no seasoning.  I expected it to be meatier (like the way artichoke is in a dip).  The Southern Fried Okra and Fried Green Tomatoes were a little too greasy for my taste.  More breading would have set them off!   My friends said the wings were just ok, they needed more sauce on them.  My friend's mom had the Grilled Salmon; she said she enjoyed it.  My friend said his Po Boy Sandwich was ok.  He went to school in New Orleans so he had high expectations. For dessert, I had the Snickers Ice Cream Pie. I was pretty underwhelmed.  It had a somewhat gritty texture, too many peanuts and was soupy.  I wanted to score Lucille's higher but too many OKs across the board.  No one was excited about their dishes.  And to me BBQ (with creole/cajun influence) is definitely supposed to be exciting! The pluses: Nice servers, the portions are very generous and as I mentioned before, we really enjoyed the biscuits."}

We have been loyal customers for the past 3+years and we feel as though they are slowly making their way down the drain.           Let me get into detail here; my last visit the waitress didn't even know she picked up a larger section then she expected so of course we were over looked for a solid 15-25 minutes when  my boyfriend decided to say something to someone. So our waitress came up and apologized LATER with a half ass apology. Excuse my French. We ordered right away, and it took forever to get anything. So my boyfriend decided at the end of our meal and drinks with our friends to pick up everyone's tab since the snooty waitress didn't split the check.    My boyfriends visit tops the cake to where I severely don't want to go back. So my boyfriend had ordered a beer and then came to realize a friends bday was that day so they ordered under 3 shots for the group. After 3 shots they were cut off and they weren't even belligerent, weird. Okay, the thing that pissed me off the most is they accused my boyfriend that he received his pretzel when he sure as hell didn't get it and they charged him for it! Nice!!!! Not. Supposedly they messed up our friends nachos as well. Lastly the waiter was a manager in the end since the first waiter kept messing up, when he cut off my boyfriend and his friends he said even though he has seen us there a lot he had to cut him off because what reason we will never know. But what I can tell you now is that the new staff they have on board isn't the same and makes me not want to go ever again."}

Why not write it down if you have trouble remembering?  He actually said as we got our checks sorry for the subpar service... well, why not do better and avoid a $1 tip? I am that person who tips 20% every time. This is the first time in my life I left $1.   Reading the vibes of the workers, they seem unhappy and that maybe they have an overbearing boss... been there so I recognize it.   The beer was good and the food the same as ever, just mediocre. I think I will request we go somewhere else for happy hour going forward."}

We have called for takeout a number of times over the last 6 months, and no one ever answers the phone. Ever!   Once my husband went into the bar to complain, placed our to go order, and the bar tender couldn't have been less bothered by it. I get he was probably busy, but the place was dead. A sorry about that was all we were looking for.  Happened a few other times and the last time, we dialed directly into the manager. We felt bad bugging him but wanted some food dammit! A pregnant woman has to have her cravings met or no one is happy. He put in our order but again, no apology or explanation as to why no one will ever answer the phone.

I have gone and had wonderful service and warm tasty food, and I have gone and had nothing but bad news bears. Lucille's to me is not GREAT barbecue, it is ok, good for Arizona probably, but far from the greatness of most barbecue pits in Texas. I do like the restaurant itself, it is fun and inviting and the waiters each take care of all the guests, teamwork style, which USUALLY means great service, but again, the coin flip.        My recent trip with Kristen and my Mommy went well, we had a terrific server (can't remember his name!), our drinks remained filled and our food came out quickly. The food itself was, again, good, not great, nothing special. The best thing was the fried okra, the best I've had actually, the okra seemed very fresh and was so tasty. I had the southern fried chicken and it was fair, the chicken alone was a little bland, but nothing the peppery gravy couldn't cure, the skin also wouldn't stay on the chicken, which is simply a pet peeve of mine, no big deal. I had sweet potato fries and mac and cheese with it, which were both delicious and I would definitely recommend them as sides. Mom got the Texas style beef brisket and Kristen the pulled pork sandwich, which were both pretty good, but nothing I didn't feel like I couldn't get at any barbecue chain. We all chose the same sides and all enjoyed them very much.        If I'm in the area and want barbecue, I would come here again, but I certainly wouldn't travel for it, I would just pick the closest barbecue chain and be just as happy. So I'm not saying don't try Lucille's, I'm just saying flip your coin carefully."}

We parked down the street because there was either little or no private parking for the brewery. It was a short walk that seemed like it took forever in the 100 degree weather.   When we reached the hostess stand we were relieved to finally get an ice old beer and enjoy our mini-vacay. However, when the security checked our IDs we were not allowed to go in. Being from California, we hold vertical IDs until we turn 22 (unless you wish to go to the DMV to change it early). In Arizona, state law invalidates vertical IDs 30 days after your 21st birthday.   Despite our protests that we are from California, security would not let us in.   We went to a nice restaurant after that, across from ASU. Upon ordering drinks there, the waiter told us that despite our vertical CA IDs, we are allowed to drink because it is not a federal law, it's only a AZ state law...  I know this review seems extensive, but we were disappointed to say the least with Four Peaks."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "It is with heavy heart I report that Lucille's, brand new to Phoenix, does not live up to its hype.   For shame this place could boast such fine decor, beautiful menus, and pleasant hospitable staff and then char the short ribs to the bone, inedible. If it wasn't for the thick sliced, juicy, fried green tomato appetizer I'd call the place a total bust. The flaky warm biscuits were nice with the honeyed sweet butter, but I know Bisquick when I taste it and I'm sure I've made these before at home. We had high hopes ordering up some blackened catfish, baby back ribs, beef brisket, chicken halves, greens, cheesy grits, garlic mashed potatoes, and a kids meal for the little one with fresh watermelon. First round was the wonderful mason jar drinks, Strawberry lemonade was sweet, fresh and thirst quenching, our muddy waters made with sweet tea and porch lemonade were good enough for three refills a piece. You'll understand however that the refills just had to keep comin' when I explain how the main course turned out.  First they served up the catfish. I could hardly see the fillet behind the nearly three cups of potatoes. When I did taste it I realized this wasn't a blackened catfish this was a water filled thin sliced sponge someone left in the charcoal pile. No wonder it was hidden by the taters. Unfortunately, they were a mass of stickiness with dried chives. I didn't find a hint of butter, or garlic for that matter. My partner is Irish through and through and was dismayed. We didn't even bother putting black pepper on them or finishing them at all. I was excited to try the cheesy grits though. My first fork pulled out a warm melting bite and so I offered some to the little one, with some greens to broaden her Northern palate. The greens were fine, but lacking in the advertised apple-wood smoked bacon. It was more like a chicken bouillon broth. She opted not to have more of either. When I went to have more grits the mixture had cooled and was more of a 4th grade science project than a good feeling.  Then came the meat platter. The chickens looked delectable and I quickly separated the meats from the bone. The dark meats were juicy, but the skin slipped off in a greasy way. The white meat was far too dry for my taste, but fortunately there were three bottled sauces we could mix together to dredge it through. Of course I believe that in a good BBQ the meat can stand on its own and you shouldn't have to dredge it in sauce to enjoy it. The brisket stood on its own. In fact it probably stood all by its lonesome out on a counter for an hour before it reached our table. Maybe cooking it in a bag instead of a dehydrator would have been a smarter method. Then came the hope of the evening, the lump of coal left to taste was apparently five baby back ribs. I had to saw them apart with a knife to free them from the creosote. The limited meat was not even worth trying to eat despite the three table sauces expertly blended to perfection waiting nearby. We tossed it back on the plate with the bones in disgust.  My daughter couldn't determine if her fries were fries or potato chips or onion straws, she decided she didn't really want them. The macaroni and cheese side was a small serving of elbow macaroni which seemed buttered lightly. Her standard is no name instant, the kind you used to buy 5 for a dollar and she was wondering where the cheese was. If I hadn't allowed the poor thing to eat the rest of the biscuits she would have gone home hungry. I will never understand how you can serve a watermelon that isn't juicy. The fruit is 90% water, but hers was an anemic example with seeds. For sure, the place had some fine appetizers and the desserts looked absolutely divine, but we were done before we even got to them and the check was already too high to consider salvaging the meal with a one pound apple pie slice. I cringed when they dropped off a comment card, but in the end I did the right thing and filled it out fair. When I want a great BBQ I think I'll be sticking to BobbyQ's where the St. Louis ribs are rubbed right and then bathed in a sauce you can't stop lickin' and where they send you home with beignets even if you don't order any, courtesy of the house."}

Found the ambiance to be 'cluttered', but probably one of this chains trademarks.  You could tell that some light shades had probably been broken and they had been substituted for something else.  Carpet was clean, our booth was clean and comfortable.  We were seated right away, but had to wait to get someone to take our drink order, which wasn't our server.  What they did was go into the kitchen to tell the server assigned to our table they had a table.  That's when our server came out and we gave our drink order a second time.  After we got our drinks, the server said that they would be right back with the biscuits which was the quickest thing done re: the whole dining experience.  We gave our dinner order when the biscuits were brought out.  For an appetizer, we ordered the onion strings, which were basic onion strings.    My dinner partner ordered the Beef Tip sandwich w/ mashed potatoes as their side.  The sandwich was lukewarm.  The mashed potatoes were cold.  We kept the sandwich as is, but had new potatoes brought out - these were hot.  Obvious that the food had been sitting on the rack waiting to be served.  My dinner partner made the comment that the sandwich would have been good if it have been hot.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken sandwich with the peanut coleslaw.  My sandwich was hot.  Problem was that chicken was cooked so that it was tough.  Tough to take a bite, tough to chew and tough to cut with the steak knife.  Made we wonder about the quality of the meat.  Through out the evening we had 4 different servers taking care of us.  Have no idea what our server was doing.  We hardly saw them out on the floor.  When they were, they at least came by 3 times to see how we were doing.  Take note, they were not the one who brought out the appetizer or the food.  We also watched as other parties came, got seated and were getting their food before we did.  Our server didn't even bring out the check, a whole other server who was trying to get their food served to their table had to drop it off.  The food was nothing special and over priced.  Definitely have had better for less.  Can't really rate our server on their service since we had so many different people coming by the table.  Were they nice and pleasant - Yes.  Did they try to fix the problem - yes.  The problem was something that shouldn't have happened in the first place.  The overall experience wasn't all that great from the very beginning.  As we watched the other tables we took note that the other tables did not have the entire 'team' thing going on.  Those servers took care of their tables and were attentive to their customers.  We will not be returning.  For the money and overall experience and 30 minute drive, not worth the trip to Tempe."}

But like everything else we ordered that night, flavor was lacking. Like a similar chain restaurant that rhymes with Blame Bumper, there's plenty of everything, but nothing you'd describe as delicious. Nothing you remember, nothing you crave.  The high notes were the deep-fried pickles, the hot and spicy sauce and the banana pudding. As many, many others pointed out, the meat was dry.  I really hate writing this sentence, because our server was an absolute sweetheart -- but if you take a customer's drink away to refill it, it needs to come back to the customer within a minute. My server forgot my refill and I was left without anything to drink while my mouth was on fire from the hot and spicy sauce. I know it's all teamwork service, but I couldn't find anyone to help me with this during my entire main course.  Here is how Lucille's can improve:  1. More servers. If you spend money on just one thing, make it more servers. They were stretched thin.  2. Better ingredients. If you're going to invest in an enormous indoor smoker (and yes, folks, they use real wood, I watched them stoke it) then invest in some quality meat.  3. Smaller portions of better food wouldn't disappoint me. There are only one or two places with really outstanding barbecue in the Phoenix area, plenty of room to compete on quality."}

I had to sit outside with the fiery sun torturing my delicate Irish skin. Want to know why they get a bad review? THERE WERE 20 OPEN TABLES AND NO ONE IN LINE. That's right. They made me sit outside in the sun instead of letting me sit at any of the numerous open tables. I promptly took our business to Casey Moore's. Never returning to Four Peaks. I don't even know if I want my beloved Kiltlifter anymore."}

I was just upset that their kitchen is currently under construction and there were only four things on their menu, all that I did not want. I mean I would not have been as upset, but I did call the night before and asked about whether they were opened and mentioned I was excited because driving from Flagstaff. Who I talked to did not even mention that the kitchen was under construction. Such a disappointment after a long drive and we really got our hopes up.   The oatmeal stout however, was outstanding."}

Ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well.  One person in our party had the chicken salad and the lettuce was really.

Not knowing what to do, we decided to seat ourselves (there was no Seat Yourselves sign out btw). We sat towards the back in the quieter section and waited...and waited...and waited! Finally a server saw us and asked us what we wanted to drink and brought us menus. It was while before she came back around to take our order.  I ordered the Margherita Pizza well done, and my guy ordered the Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas. Well, when my pizza arrived it was obvious that is was not well done as the cheese was still goopy and white, and not browned and bubbly. My guy liked his plate, but admitted that the rice was par boiled cheapo rice and not as good as many enchiladas he's had in the past. I took my pizza back and asked for Fish and Chips instead, which came out quickly enough, but were just okay, nothing special. When I took my pizza back our server assured us that the Manager would come over to apologize, but he never did!  Overall, not impressed! I would never come back."}

The waiter was more focused on people who ordered alcohol when my friend and I bought food and an appetizer, it's not like we were at the bar top. Takes forever for refills. We split checks and instead of printing a check for my friend and I separately he stood there for three minutes trying to split and do the math in his head. Btw my friend was charged $3 for a soda, so at that point you might as well order something with alcohol in it. We both give him our cards after this long period of mental math he did you would think he would swipe the cards right plus one is chase blue and the other was black. Well he split the checks and swiped my card for both checks.  The checks just listed the amount on them so there is no proof of what my friend or I ordered.   Honestly if the wings weren't so good I wouldn't go back. I still plan to go but if I see this waiter I will more than confidently walk out and eat somewhere else."}

Now the biscuits are kinda weird.  They look like a roll, crumble like a muffin, and taste like cake.  I KNOW!  Weird!  (see photos) I was expecting some real homemade southern biscuits.  And the apple butter was cinnamon butter NOT apple butter.  I was all confused, and we only ended up getting one basket (2 biscuits) cause our waitress was so busy and the other staff forgot us.  The salad was descent.  The size of it was huge.  The meat wasn't that tender.  Kinda disappointed with it.  My husband got a burger.  And said it was the best burger he ever had.

We ordered an appetizer that never came out and 30 minutes later when we got our meals I asked him about the fried pickles and he apparently never put the order in because we didn't get them until after we were all done eating and he didn't even comp them. Then there was a hair in my friends sandwich, we finally got his attention to get her a new one and he seemed annoyed at us and didn't even apologize.

I told the guy to take it bad and I ordered wings instead...the wings aren't good... I should of ordered salad.. you can't screw that up.   This place is like a Olive Garden, Chili's, Red Lobster for BBQ. Real nasty food. Nothing special about it at all.

I tried the popper burger made which chicken breast & it was extremely huge & messy/hard to eat. The fried onions were really oily & the chicken wasn't grilled well so it ended up being really dry. Their nachos & spinach artichoke dip aren't bad.  Keep in mind that at this location, parking is a little bit of a pain. They don't have much of a private parking lot so you'll have to find street parking. Plan on taking a little bit of walk to the restaurant because it's almost always ridiculously busy. Additionally, if you're going there as a group, they don't take reservations and require at least half of your party to be there before you can be added to their list to get a table. Even though they're busy, I do have to note that every time I've been there, the service was good and they were accommodating and offered to do separate checks if we wanted."}

I was in town for 5 days with a group of guys for Spring Training baseball. This is the 7th year that we have done this trip. It is a group of early 30 year olds and our fathers. We eat all over town and spend alot of money each year.   We arrived at the restaurant by taxi and got our table immediately. We sat at our table and were greeted by our server. We ordered a round of drinks for everyone but one, and immediately the server said that one person in our group wasn't allowed to be served until they ate a little bit. Understandable, I run a restaurant in Vegas and know liquor liability and it was responsible of her to make that decision. But then the manager who looked as if this was his first restaurant job shifted the situation and said he couldn't serve any of us. This immediately pissed us all off and ruined our experience. The server already cut one person off and the manager blew this situation out of proportion. Not only did he lose a customer but I am so irate how he embarrassed our table and made our experience unbearable. He is a terrible asset to your company and should never be able to run a restaurant again. He lost money from your restaurant from people who all work in the hospitality industry in Vegas.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "In my continued effort to find good barbeque in the desert I stopped by Lucille's for lunch. There were a good number of customers, but it was not overcrowded. The restaurant had several employees working as well. The ribs sounded very good, as did the chicken. I thought I would go with the rib & chicken combo, then I noticed the Carolina baked potato & salad combo. That stood out for me because in Atlanta I used to go regularly to Champs BBQ and always ordered the Hickory Baked Potato. The description on Lucille's menu was similar, so I made my selection.  The waiter brought out complimentary buttermilk rolls and cinnamon butter. Okay, he said complimentary rolls, but it was a singular roll. It was a little hard, but edible. Tasted like something you would get from the KFC drive thru. It took several minutes for the waiter to bring my diet coke and I never received a refill while I was there.  The meal arrived and the first thing I noticed was the salad. It took me back to 1975 when I good salad included iceberg lettuce and cherry tomatoes. Yep, that's what it was...plus some carrot shavings and croutons. After seeing the purple cabbage, I believe it was the prepackaged salad in a bag from the grocery...inspired by 1975. The ranch dressing continued the time warp. It was very runny - I think from being the final remnants of the original bottle of dressing and they added water to extend the number of servings. Very blah and plain.  Another interesting item on the plate was the small watermelon wedge. WTF?   The baked potato definitely was not Champs. It was dry, which okay I get that I can pick my sauce for the topping. I chose the dark BBQ sauce. It was good - sweet and molassessy (is that a word?). I took the pulled pork version of the potato and it included sour cream, cheese, scallions and was just okay for me. I ate it, but I will continue my search for a good local BBQ place.  Another thing I wouldn't recommend is going there if you are on a typical work lunch. As I mentioned it wasn't overcrowded and there was staff on hand, but the service was slow. The coke took a while, when the food was brought out he asked if it looked okay and I didn't see him again until I was finished and impatiently waiting on the check (several minutes after being finished...)  The price for the potato was $9.75 - probably a touch too high for what you receive. There wasn't that much meat on the potato. The coke was also $2.95 - so maybe water would be a better choice.   Slow service, slightly higher price and just average potato (below average salad) makes this place just okay for me. I tried it, but I would prefer to go elsewhere."}

The food isn't great and is rather overpriced for what you get, but it's basically average pub-grub (price aside). I'd avoid the Reuben, though. I don't know what they do to their corned beef, but it's like chewing on corned beef-flavored rubber. However their club sandwich is reasonably decent as is the fish and chips (although occasionally the batter is too thick).

They had this AMAZING seasonal Pumpkin Porter this winter.... *le sigh* So. Delicious. And the salmon BLT is a contender for my last meal on earth.  The beer battered fries are delicious as well and even their side salad is unusually tasty for you know, a simple side salad.  I don't come here very often since it's a bit of a drive for me from Phoenix but when I do stop by its during the workweek around 6-9.  Not sure what the scene is like on weekend, I'd imagine it gets lively what with all the alcohol and sporting events being broadcast on the many TV's hanging inside.  The wait staff has always been prompt and friendly.  The clientele is usually pretty diverse mix of Tempe folks.  Usually very spirited, which is not really what I look for in a drinking establishment but by no means bad and at the very least entertaining.  I get annoyed that every time I come to this place they analyze my ID for like 3 minutes and usually ask for alternate forms of ID.  I understand it's a necessary precaution, really, I do, but its still annoying.  Reckon I should update the photo on my ID huh.

SO fast forward 3-ish months and i go back to casey moores with some friends. i was there last night and GREAT the same bouncer is surprisingly still working there. when the night ended i was outside the bar in the parking lot and the bouncer comes up to me and whispers if you fcking tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here and i respond with what?? and he says it again you heard me. if you tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here. you're on a list you know and then went into the bar. i hear the bouncer get crazy in the bar and start yelling and gathering staff and is talking and pointing at me. so i just stand there and wave.  also great idea to make a scene like that in front of a parking lot full of people if you don't want me telling anyone.  sorry bouncer. i told the internet about how shitty you are. maybe have some respect for people and talk to people nicely.  i'm not sure what else to say but i wanted to tell my story about 2/5 of my experiences of ever going there. i'm fine with not being let back in, especially if they're going to keep staff like this around.

I was going I take a picture of the stack of appetizer, salad, and side plates at the end of our table cause they were there for sinking and when I finally decided to whip out the camera she cleared them. Must have seen me typing. Lol. Refills were non existent, server forgot Jen's beer she ordered after being seated and finally brought it after my second refill on soda and after Jen asked for a different beer. She was apologetic and I'm the last person to be mean or belittle a server unless they are outright rude. Our server wasn't rude; just having a bad night i guess.

It was the sound of frustration. I really do love this place. And I was sooooo determined tom order something different than the New Orleans chicken which I can't seem to tear myself away from. Tonight, I was a pioneer; a trend setter; Capt. Kirk. In orders their marinated steak cooked mid rare. Mmmmmmm. Well ironworks have been of it wasn't over cooked and completely bland and flavorless. If that hunk of meat had been marinated for 24 hours like the menu states, it must have been in a bucket of water.  Booooo. See what happens when you try new things!  Jen order ribs and some burnt ends bbq'd meat combo. They were good. That's all I can say. I didn't even ask for a box for mine.   Also, I'm all for a nice AC environment during the AZ summer but holy smokes, I couldn't find a knife so I cut my steak with my nipples.

I'm sad now. :(  P.S.  Quit taking my silverware and leaving me nothing to eat with. Also, the Mac and cheese was bland and was really bad.  There is virtually no cell service and absolutely no wi-fi. So frustrating. Ok I'm done."}

It's large in scale with indoor/outdoor seating, plenty of beer options and a good atmosphere. I had the Four Peaks burger. By burger standards, it was just a burger...nothing spectacular. But, it cooked right for me. My business partner had a sandwich and his comment was , It was alright. So, good is a fair description.  Waitstaff was on her game. Very friendly, asked if it was our first time, offered suggestions, and came back often. If I'm in the mood for a brew pub, I'll go back."}

The TVs need a major upgrade. With try roof and room size every tv should be 60 or bigger. There should be twice as many TVs. Have no clue who laid out there system but it is really poorly done especially again since the space begs for 60 plus TVs hanging from the rafters.    The beer is excellent and the food smells great.   Bathrooms are horrendous. Dirty, small, and in need of major overhaul."}

The only thing we seriously dislike about Four Peaks is parking. Parking is absolutely atrocious! Its so bad in fact it becomes a reason not to bother going. In the past we've actually spent 20 or more minutes trying to find parking. And this is the reason for my star rating, I'd give it more of a 3.5 if I could. I wish I could give them 4 stars but I just can't, the parking is just that bad, unfortunately."}

I have been here twice the first time we came it was about an hour before the kitchen was going to close. The bartender had an attitude, I'm sure at that point in the night she was just looking to go home there's was only about 10 people sitting at the bar because it was during the week. While her attitude was noticeable, I tried not to let it effect my experience. I've served before so I know it sucks sometimes when you get last minute people, however she could've tried harder to hide her disappointment. We didn't see her much the whole time we were there.   We got:  Calamari: maybe I'm being picky but I like when the calamari is in rings, I don't like it in stick form. It was still good and comes with two sauces, the greenish colored sauce is really good. If was jalapeño type cream sauce, very good.  Peanut sauce wings: good, not amazing but I did like them.  Edamame: hands down the best I've ever had. Four peaks style is slightly spicy and very garlicky, I absolutely loved them.  Got the white ale both visits and I really liked it, refreshing, reminded me of a better version of blue moon.   This past Friday we went again, it was very busy inside and out.   Again the service was lacking. We waited quite a while for our appetizer that never came. Finally our food comes out, trying to get our server to stop for more than a second was nearly impossible, when she checked on us when our food came it was more of a walk by glance, eventually the next time she walked by (about a third of the way through my food) we stopped her long enough to say we never got our appetizer, she asked if I still wanted it I said yes. She said the kitchen forgot it but I know that's server language for I never rang it in and am passing the responsibility off onto the kitchen. It was busy so I tried to be understanding, maybe both visits we just got servers on off nights. Hopefully next time around we will get better service.   This time we got:  Carne asada tacos: very very delicious, my only dislike was they had corn tortillas which I prefer the, less authentic, flour tortilla. Just a flavor and texture thing but the meat and cheese and other toppings were 5 star.   The pizza: don't know the name but it had different meat on it, pepperoni, sausage, I think I ham. It was good, not the best pizza ever but still delicious.  And again the edamame (which was what was forgotten): it came out hot this time, four peaks style like our first visit which I absolutely love.   Overall the food and beers are very good, I'm hoping next time we get a more attentive server."}

We got there after 6:30, hoping to grab a table or seats at the bar & make our orders quickly before HH ends at 7.  Well of course the bar seats & every table was taken.  All of the waiters/waitresses seemed so rushed & overwhelmed.  We finally found the hostess & asked for a table for three.  As she went off to look for a table, another hostess came up to us.  I specifically stated that we were there for HAPPY HOUR.  And she was like WELL ARE YOU EATING?  I had to make this point twice.  Then the first hostess came back & said she could seat us upstairs (I didn't even know they had a second floor!).  Well, bad idea.  First, the decor upstairs was a lame attempt at making the Oyster House look the least bit classy.  Then, the waitress told us happy hour is only available downstairs.  Wow.  After a second look for an available table downstairs, we decided to just stay on the second floor & pay the regular price for oysters ($12 per dozen versus $10 per dozen during HH).  The service upstairs was super slow.  The waitress wasn't even paying close attention when we made our orders because she definitely forgot my friend's beer.  The good thing was she comped it since he waited for like over half an hour.  The oysters tasted extra fishy that day, not like the first time I tried them here.  I lost my appetite for anything else after that.  My boyfriend's solution to the fishy-ness: mask the taste with horseradish & lots of Tabasco!"}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Hmmm I have some mixed feelings about Casey Moore's. The place is always packed so it's definitely a popular spot. I used to come here all the time back in the college days. This time I came here on a busy weekend night around 8 pm for dinner and drinks. There isn't really a system for getting any kind of table so you have to fend for yourself. We were able to get a spot but waiting for a waitress to come took a while. Like I said it was busy but maybe they just need more staff or something. Once we had our server everything was great! We (ok maybe just I) ordered way too much food. I got the scampi shrimp boat, a dozen oysters, and escargot. You get a ton of escargot, not just the six that you normally get in the dish. The size of the shrimp boat was generous as well. Everything was perfectly cooked and the garlic bread was awesome for dipping in the extra garlic butter. The oysters were just ok. I feel like a place that has oyster in the name should have an actual selection of different oysters and they should be served detached from the shell. They didn't have a ton of flavor either so that was a bummer. We ordered oyster shooters as well which was a huge mistake. I don't know what I was expecting but the giant oyster, mix of tomato (?) juice, and the world's cheapest vodka was not pleasant at all.   Casey Moore's definitely caters to the college drinking crowd, especially on the weekends. So I would recommend if you're coming in for dinner to do it on a quieter night where there's hopefully a bit more organization. Also, if you have an aversion to cigarette smoke the patio is not for you. Everyone around us was smoking it makes for an unpleasant dining environment."}

I tried the Green Chile Pork Poutine and the Four Peaks Peach Ale Sangria. The latter was delicious and light, which was exactly what I wanted. The poutine was so so so good and the portion was huge!

I guess I can see that if you're a local and you're familiar with the area.   The place was absolutely packed and we were told it'd be a 20 min wait. It was actually more like 10 mins and we were seated near a TV.   I had thought a sports bar would be good to chill and hang out. I didn't realize we'd be surrounded by college boys/men and have to shout to talk over all the loud yelling & TV.   The food came quickly & our food wasn't bad. I had the chicken noodle soup (which didn't have much chicken 'or' noodle).   It had a 'Hooters' type feel to it as all the waitresses were in a uniform and most were 'booty shorts'. Part of you feels bad for them.. part of you knows that they know what's going on.   Not a bad place but definitely gets packed despite how large the place is. We were seated indoors but outdoors seemed very laidback as well."}

I am truly saddened that Four Peaks has become just another chain restaurant.

We arrived at Four Peaks at 3:30 P.M. on Wednesday 08-02-17.   Finding a place to park, without cars driving your way is a challenge. You have to park approximately 300 feet away from the main entrance (behind the brewery) and that will only happen if one of the total twenty five parking spots are open. You have to walk towards incoming traffic to make your way towards the entrance.   The air conditioning was not on. Today was overcast and VERY humid in the valley. I could feel how stuffy and sticky the brewery was the second we walked in. I could see people (not just myself) fanning themselves. I do not think that the staff really cared to cool off the inside by turning on the air conditioning.   The worst part of today was the lack of service. We spent about an hour at the main bar (right behind the huge beer fermentation tanks). The bartender approached us a total of four times which included taking our order and delivering our order. Most of the time, a lot of the staff, not just our bartender seemed preoccupied with talking to each other or aimlessly walking around instead of paying attention to customers, details, and trying to craft a great experience so more customers will want to return."}

Our water was ok, but super slow when it came to the checks and actually checking in on us. I liked the biscuits, but they were not amazing, a nice touch after waiting for so long to get a table though. No one in my party was amazed by their meals but one of the most disappointing was the mac and cheese. It sounded so good, but came out dry and mushy- gross enough to turn you off of mac and cheese for a couple of weeks.

(Partly my fault) A few of the side orders were wrong and it took some time for the waiter to reappear once the main course was served... That being said, once the waiter appeared and we had a chance to explain everything that was wrong with the meal both he and the management were very nice and fast in correcting everything.  Not only did they replace the sausage with another and correct the side order issue, they also provide myself with a set of baby backs on the house.  So, in closing, food not that great and pricey.

The spicy sausage that came with my appetizer ( three types of sausage came with the appetizer) was tasty and there was plenty to share with my 5 coworkers. Drinks were generous as well.  CONS: I prefer that my brisket has a  nice bark with a red ring around the edge. I also prefer my sausage casing to be firm and have a nice pop when I cut it. I had the sausage appetizer. The cheddar sausage ( one of the 3 sausages with the appetizer) tasted like something from the grocery store. Not bad but totally forgettable. The chips with the nachos seemed slightly over-fried. They have appetizer and drink specials during happy hour that you have to walk to the bar to get. This is ludicrous to me. I'm at you establishment, but you are going to charge me more money for the exact same items because I didn't get up and get them myself?!?  OVERALL: Decent service and decent food.

The shrimp and goat cheese bruchetta sounded like an awesome appetizer... unfortunately it wasn't bruchetta.  Bruchetta requires crunchy bread or toast points.

My side was sweet potato fries, which were a nice portion and not over cooked.  I dipped my burger in all three of their barbecue sauces... the spicy one is spicy!!

I was with a large group of 10 people and we ordered some beers and food (coming to an oyster house and being told they don't recommend them on the half shell) and when we got our food the waiter got our order completely wrong and when we told her what happened instead of apologizing and offering to make it right she proceeded to tell us that was what we had ordered and that we were the ones who were wrong! I couldn't believe my ears! When I politely told her again that was not what we had ordered she kept arguing with us and then just took the food and left. I was beside myself. I have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and she shot back that there was not a supervisor on that night. Yeah I believe that. So we promptly left and were NEVER not once offered one single apology, instead we were told that we were wrong and then ignored. Will never set foot in this establishment again and I hope to speak with the owner to let him/her know the level of wait staff they have representing their restaurant."}

Also disappointing was that out of 12 oysters, only ONE was shucked.  They tasted good, but were obviously hard to eat since we had to dig them off the shell...  This place is mostly a bar with a small dining room.  The doormen checking ID were very kind in directing my under-age daughter and I to the dining room, where we enjoyed the meal. The cooked food we ordered (burger and sandwich) were good -- nothing amazing but good.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "This review is long overdue.  My husband and I have lived in Tempe for almost 10 years and finally made it to Casey Moore's after some friends simply could NOT believe we've never been there before.  So we decided to make a stop after an afternoon at the Phoenix Art Museum for some Bloody Mary hangover healing on Valentines Day 2015.  I was expecting the usual Mill Ave college crowd mixed together with hipsters, hippies, and pseudo intellectuals and I was not disappointed.  We found a seat at a sticky, dirty table next to the little fish pond and had a lovely time watching the birds fight over forlorn french fries strewn under empty tables.  I am over the people watching.  If you're in Tempe, that means you're looking at half dressed 21 year old coeds, or taking shots every time you see some dude with a koi fish sleeve tattoo.  Sorry for the snark, I am SOOOOO tired of the lookalikes on Mill.  Maybe I'm getting too old for this, but seriously....  I digress.  As many others have stated, you come here for the atmosphere and the above average bar food and drinks.  We waited and waited and waited for someone to come take our drink order before my husband finally went to the bar and ordered our drinks.  I would have asked him to order additional drinks had I known how slow the service was going to be - and it wasn't even busy!  Our Bloody Marys came out fairly quickly once we ordered them, and I ordered fried oysters.  The waiter brought out the other kind.  The slippery, boogery, still stuck to it's crusty shell kind.  I was a good sport and ate two.  My husband finished off the rest.    I will add that sometime that weekend we conceived our son, so maybe I should throw an extra star their way because we often joke the oysters and Bloody Marys are what did it.  My husband happens to really like this place, so I suppose I should throw in an additional star.  But this is my review, not his, so two it is.  One for the food and one for the atmosphere.  The others they could earn by improving service and running a Clorox wipe over the tables."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "So disappointed with my experience tonight that I'll likely never return to this location again and question if I will continue to patronize the chain at all.  I've been to 6 or 8 of their locations and have ALWAYS without question had a great experience both in terms of food quality and service.  Tonight however was different.  I walked into my home town Lucille's and was smugly 'greeted' by some half hazard welcome.  The guy serving as host was less than friendly but managed to ask me how many in my party?  One, I replied ..from here he speaks into his headset microphone to summons someone to come seat me.  He hands her my soon to be menu and says 'put him in the bar'.  Now there are many times that I prefer to sit in the bar, but tonight just wasn't one of them and furthermore I would just prefer to have been asked if this option was ok.  I had just landed from a week long business trip and stopped by Lucille's to have dinner to allow the traffic to die down.  I might also add that I was dressed in business attire .. I didn't look like some bum off the street and couldn't understand why I couldn't have a regular table with the others.  I was shuffled off to the bar where I was offered one of the high top tables.  My money is obviously not good enough to rent one of the 30+ empty dining room tables for 20 - 30 minutes.  It was 5:15 pm by the way ... it was ahead of the prime busy dinner period of 6pm, etc.  Every single high top table was empty also to give you an idea of how busy the place was.  I didn't want a high top table so I asked for something else .. I was offered some random 6-top table sitting right in the entrance of the bar .... I'm one person .. WHY would I want a 6-top table?  Well, obviously again my money is simply not welcome for a dinning room table with the common folk.  I didn't want this large table or its poor location ... so my third and final option was the booth right out of the kitchen .. it was obvious that there was no way that I was going to get one of those seemingly high demand empty dinning room tables.  I asked the girl that seated me why I was not given a choice if I wanted to sit in the bar.  She became a bit defensive and said 'that's why I asked you if wanted to sit here or over there' ... NO, not you .. I wanted to know why the rude guy that told you to seat me in bar didn't give me a choice.  What if I was a recovering alcoholic .. doesn't matter .. you are only 1 person and their perception is that you wouldn't tip enough to get a dinning room table.  Reality is I tip very well .. and I know what I want, order fast, and I'm out of there .. IF there was demand for the tables they would have been better off to put me in the dinning room as I would have allowed them to turn the table over more quickly than a family coming in for a night of chatting and occupying the table.  Whatever ...  After I sat in my assigned bar booth for nearly 15 minutes without anyone even approaching my table I finally gave up and took my unworthy self out the front door ...  It's really sad to see how quickly the service is fading at this restaurant ....  Sad, Sad, Sad ....  I made my way down the parking lot to The Keg ,, incidentally, I tipped my server (who was phenomenal)  $20 on a $42 dinner.  The whole experience as enjoyable starting with walking in the door and being treated with a smile and a warm welcome. When the hostess asked how many in my party and I replied 'one' she then asked, would you prefer to be seated in our dining room or lounge area?  Obviously I opted for the dinning room."}

Perfect candidate for that restaurant impossible show.  TONS of tables empty but told there would be a 30 minute wait.   Grabbed a table near the bar and a waitress took our happy hour drink orders.  20 minutes later still no drinks.  They told us our table was ready and the table they had  for us was almost on top of the hostess table where about 12 other customers were crowded around waiting for tables.  The fact that they would even seat people there is Sad.  (This table btw was empty when we first came in so I don't understand the 20 minute wait for the crappiest table in Town)  We said we didn't want to sit there and they told us it would be ANOTHER 20 min for another table even though there were many empty tables in the restaurant and on patio.  We said we'd go back to our table near the bar and have our drinks there which our waitress had said were almost ready. We went back and the waitress brought our silverware.  We asked where our drinks were and she said they were coming out soon and they were really weeded tonight.  I said we've been waiting twenty minutes and she said I told them to hurry up already she then ran to the computer and typed something in so I don't think she ever put in our drink orders.  We look over at the bar and the bartender is chillin out, looking relaxed leaning up against the bar talking leisurely to a customer.  How long does it take Lucile's to pour a shot and a couple of beers?  I guess I will never know because my party was too impatient to wait more than 25 minutes for our drinks.  Got there at 6:30 to take advantage of happy hour- left at 6:54 very sober and hungry and too late to get to any other happy hours.  If they can't pour a drink in under 25 minutes, I can't imagine how long it would have taken us to receive food.  Everyone who worked there looked and acted like it was their first day on the job.  The only thing Lucile's succeeded in doing was giving me and my fam bam the blues."}

So, much so that when I found out there was once kinda close to where we lived I couldn't wait to take my wife there. We saved money and bought gift cards so we could take a late afternoon during a Saturday and go. My Ma got a gift card of her own too because we wanted to go enjoy the food and show my wife what we thought would be a great place to eat. It turned out not so much.  We went yesterday 5/2/2015 to this location and it was a very hot day. We drove from Glendale, AZ near 67th Ave and Bethany Home. Those in AZ and know what the heat was like yesterday know what that drive can be like. My wife has a heat condition so when we were seated on the indoor patio we sat there for a few seeing if it would cool down and her temp would as well but no such luck. So, we asked if we could be moved just inside where it was much cooler. A hostess came and got us and took us to the other side of the restaurant again tried to seat us just in another area of the inside patio. My Ma asked her for the free table that was just inside from where we had been to begin with. So there we were finally seated and finally could feel cool air.   We were forgotten several times. We got one order of bread which was hard like it had been sitting out for a long while. No butter with the bread. And then finally came our food and my Ma asked for fresh bread. The waiter said right away.  My Ma's food was fried chicken (tasted great!), grilled vegetables ( which were boiled and could tell by all the water on her plate), and then gravy for her mashed potatoes which should have had some thickness to it but was like water. I had mashed potatoes which tasted great, and steak which was suppose to be medium rare but was more like well and was more like a piece of carne asada I would get at a Mexican restaurant and the steak gravy tasted extremely different than it did from the one in CA like they had added a major spiciness to it. My wife got a  fried shrimp Po Boy to be simple since she didn't want to risk eating anything to heavy with the heat. The shrimp was small - medium size tasted okay. There was 2 tomato slices in the sandwich that were sliced so thick as if they should have been in a hamburger and very bad lettuce. (I would have taken pictures but I try not to take out/or have my phone on when I am out with my family)  I believe when we were just about done eating (about 20 min in) and no one had still come by to see how everything was and no bread still came I believe she was an assistant manager came by and asked how everything was. My Ma let her know how bad it had been. Talking to this manager for about 5-10 min and the waiter starts to come with the bread and she tells him we don't want it no more cause at that point we didn't. We had a very disappointing dinner. My Ma and I both felt bad to take my wife to such a bad experienced dinner.  The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the district manager came over and talked to us apologized for everything and said she'd be sending us out some gift cards to hopefully try them again. And because even though a lot of it was wrong and didn't taste good, some did taste good and MAYBE we caught this place on a wrong day. If we do receive the cards as told then we will return and give it another try after the sun goes down though.   10/10/2015 So, it has taken me a while to come back and do this but I changed the stars to 1 cause about a month after posting this we finally received the gift card from them to go back and it was only for $25 when the manager had said she'd make sure we got all our money back in gift cards so we could go back and have a better experience. We still have the gift card and not sure when or if we'll use it here or wait and see when we can make it back to California or just sell it. Probably be the latter."}

The waitress was nice but she needed to speak up a little louder. It was pretty noisy inside with the music and other noise.  I ordered a bleu cheese burger, not the one offered on the menu that has bacon in it. I don't eat bacon. She accommodated me. I ordered a drink called the Peachy Keen because I had just come from the Arizona Distillery and Four Peaks uses their bourbon in that drink. I'm not going to lie here, the drink was not good to me because it had a strong beer taste and I don't like beer. They use their Peach ale in that drink and it overpowers the other flavors including the bourbon. Don't get it if you don't like the taste of beer. My burger, which came out as I ordered it (medium well) was delivered really fast. I don't know how you make a medium well burger that fast. Anyway, It was not juicy, it was not bad, it was not great, it was edible. My friends liked their food. One of my friends ordered a quesadilla and she said it was good. My other friend ordered nachos and it was huge. She ate some and took the rest home. Anyway, I don't like leaving bad reviews, but my experience was blah."}

So good we would do our business entertaining there.  When we moved home to Az we were very excited to find that they were putting one in Tempe.  Our first visit was good, but for some reason not as good as Vegas, but they were new and we figured they needed a chance to get started.  Second visit, still not so good, third visit, decided not to go back.  That was awhile ago.  Today, my daughter wanted to have lunch there and she only remembers the Nv Lucille's as she has been in Wa.  for a few years.  So we went.   Here's how it went...... She had a Cobb salad and ordered with no eggs, came covered in eggs, sent it back.  Came back with raw chicken......worried me cause although she took it off her salad, it had still touched the rest of her salad and she is breast feeding.  Her husbands fried chicken was so bad that he wouldn't eat it and that boy eats like crazy.  My son had the tri tip that was melt in your mouth in Vegas, but not here.  It was tough and fatty.  I had the sea food platter.  It was something I had never seen. It looked like it was coated with corn meal plastic.  Burnt corn meal plastic.  I peeled it off and there was a teeny tiny piece of cat fish in there.  The grilled artichoke was ok but the dip was wall paste, the fried okra was good, but hey, it's not fresh, it's frozen.  The sweet tea was wonderful and our waiter was nice.  Bottom line......go to Green Valley, next to Vegas.........skip Tempe.  It cost 92 dollars to eat lunch at Lucille's and I use the term  eat loosely.  I feel like I was robbed!  Not one of us was happy.

My husband had the White Ale which he liked. Finally seated outside about 8:45 PM our waiter was Steven. Chose first available for seating and it was till quite warm outdoors!  When receiving the menus they handed us a small additional flier with their Saturday specials. Originally, I ordered the Herb Grilled Shrimp. My husband had the lettuce wraps / wings & our son got the beer breaded chicken sandwich.  Our server informed me they were out of the Shrimp, so I ordered the other special- Chicken Ala King.  Meals arrived minus mine, it was approx. 8 minutes later that my meal showed up to the table; after everyone else were already into theirs. I had a thought of cancelling. The chicken was dry, however the dish itself was good. It was a linguine tomato cream sauce with al dente corn, peas & carrots.  Wings were just average Franks Red, no big deal! Lettuce wraps perfect for a warm evening outside, but there was something with a kick, very spicy! The beer bread chicken sandwich wasn't what you expect. It's actually similar to a burrito in looks. A thin bread wrapped up and sliced. It was cheesy goodness and tasty! Couldn't finish.  Downside was the atmosphere & service. Food & server were somewhat lacking from our experience.

We were on a bit of a time crunch and had about an hour to eat and get to our destination. Plenty of time normally. Service was great overall. Our waitresses name was Desert(spelling), she was very nice and did a great job. We watched multiple tables get their food before us. They were all seated after us. We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting. We ended up waiting about 30 more minutes and we had to leave before we could eat. We canceled the food and I was told the manager would be out to speak with me. So I then waited another ten minutes for the manager (Tiffany) to come out. At this point I almost walked out without paying for anything, but I didn't want to leave the waitress with that. The manager wasn't really the nicest about the situation. Wasn't very apologetic and offered to comp the dish(nothing else). I wasn't going to pay for the dish anyways but thanks. I was ready to pay for what we had consumed though. I left a tip for the waitress on my check. After realizing it the managers name was on the receipt as the waitress, so I'm hoping that she didn't get her tip because I would have left no tip at thay point. I have a pretty bitter taste about this place right now. We were almost 30 minutes late to where we were going which was a Rattlers football game. We ended up missing the entire firdt quarter."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I ate there tonight after many months of curiosity and all I can say is: When it comes to atmosphere, this place is like the BB King theme park at Disneyworld! But SO WHAT?! It's the most overpriced mediocre BBQ in Arizona. The quality of the food is SUBSTANTIALLY better at a chain like Famous Dave's (which they have all over Maricopa County). Purveyors of great BBQ know that it never comes cheap, but this place isn't even good, let alone great. Let me be more specific: Whether you like your ribs dry or wet isn't the issue. The issue is: Is there any meat on them? I've had great pork ribs from little Chinese restaurants with the juicy meat somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 inch high from the bone! The baby back and St. Louis pork ribs at Lucille's were more like 1/8 of an inch of meat or less over the bone...and not the least bit juicy.   This place is more of a tourist trap than a restaurant. If you ever paid over $100 for a meal for two people and walk away leaving food on your plate because it wasn't tasty enough to take with you, you know how I feel."}

After patiently waiting, we asked to be seated in the enclosed porch, which was fine. It took a while for our server to come, but she was cheerful & pleasant. Thought our lunch may be looking better, but no. Remaining service pretty slow (even with what they called the team approach), portions small for the price, food bland, barbecue sauces average at best, cornmeal crusted catfish and shrimp very heavy.

So I walk in, solid system if all you have to do to get into your bar and not get carded is say I'm ordering to go, and the bartender just says take a seat. Ok, someone makes sense here finally because I don't want to drink beer to begin with.  So we sit down, have our food, finish, then I notice the bouncer coming to our table. He says I see you didn't listen to me, you have to pack up it up. I tell him we only order food and water, with our water sitting right there. His next response is what got it, I don't care. You didn't listen, now pack it up and get the fuck out. I said to the out of shape fat bouncer, well I need my damn check and a box unless you want to just give me a free meal.   Our waiter was good and she was even amazed that he swore at us. But what really got me when I called the manager to just let them know about the attitude of the bounce, the manager made up excuses like we get a lot of college people trying to pull a fast one and I would have told someone pulling a fast one to get the fuck out. We'll you know what, all I had was water and my bill says that, so I don't see why assume you should be allowed to swear at a customer that was told by the bar to just take a seat.   Oh, the place has a nice roach infestation. I saw 3 go by once I finished my meal. I thought I was going to be sick. Don't go to this place, it's a shit hole environment, the food is average. The only good this is the service. But if I see roaches and the managers make up excuses to let their staff sweat at customers, I don't think I'll be coming back even when I am 21."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "Words cannot even express how much I hate this place. It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.  Visit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.  Visit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.  Visit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?  Visit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there. Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar... We don't. He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). No, I told you we don't. Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.  I mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore. I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way."}

The biscuits are super tasty and can be pretty dangerous...if you can limit yourself to just one, I applaud you!  We started off with fried pickles...I love that they are dill spears! They reminded me of the fried pickles I had in Miami last year.  They were delicious!  I got the beef brisket sandwich and it was fantastic! One of the perks is that they not only add sauce to the brisket, but they also have 3 bottles of sauce on the table for you to add to your liking: original BBQ, Memphis style BBQ, and HOT and SPICY (my favorite).  As a side, I stuck to the french fries which I now regret, because they weren't that great.  I knew I should have tried the cheesy grits!   My best friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and she said it was very tender.  Her side of choice as the Mac n'cheese...I sampled and me likey! Super cheesy and creamy!  There were only a couple of things I wasn't thrilled with: 1.  Our food took FOREVER to arrive after our appetizers.  However, the service was excellent and friendly! 2.  The sweet tea (which on the upside is served in a mason jar...I absolutely LOVE this), was beyond sweet! Next time, I'll order 1/2 sweet tea, 1/2 regular tea.    That's pretty much it.

My Wife goes to the can, I sit at the (pretty empty) bar, right in front of a dark haired female, presumably washing glasses.  I sat and watched her for 5 minutes.  When she finished, she turned around and welcomed and took orders from 2 females who JUST sat down at the bar, before me......JUST!  My Wife returned and asked about beverages.  I told her, jokingly, that I was being discriminated against because I was old, bald, had an earring and wore the wrong college t-shirt (Faber College;  Animal House). As she walked away (again) I summoned her and told her I had been sitting for 5 mins and, that she greeted and served other patrons before me and we would like some service, PLEASE! Her rude and less than customer service ensued.  Oh, we got our beverages and our food, but at her pace.  Seems the other end of the bar had more friendly people for her to entertain than the other side of the bar that had minimal customers.   When our relatives arrived, we repaired to the adjacent high top room, back near the golf video machine.  I left my minimal 20% tip @ the bar.  As we re-acquainted, it was obvious the room had cleared out, empty, and we were without service! I hailed a bus person and asked if the area we were in was closed. He got us a waiter right away.  Not one, but two!  But this was lame, also.  The waiter took an adult beverage order and in 10 mins came back with 3 waters!  Oh c'mon?  3 drafts vs 3 waters in 10 mins?

I tried hers and I thought it was good, although a bit bland. I ordered a special, the BBQ chicken beer bread sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was good, it had chipotle bbq sauce, chicken, cheddar, and fried onion strings. The onion strings really made the sandwich (well, more like a wrap...but whatever). I got the balsamic dressing, and it was really good. It was probably the best thing we got. At the end we all split the stout tiramisu. This was pretty good, but I like the classic better. It is tiramisu made with chocolate mascarpone and with stout beer. I couldn't taste the stout much after the first couple bites, the chocolate took over.

We went in for the special menu and found the buffet to LOOK very nice but to fall short of an actual delivery. For $32 per person, we got Eggs Benedict, whose English muffin couldn't be cut with a standard knife (trust me, I tried, and I worked at it so hard I almost knocked the table over), undercooked but okay prime rib (should have had an option for cuts that were cooked more and less fatty - looked like a quality starter cut to begin with). The bacon and sausage tasted bulk-made and the waffles came with a Knotts Breakfast Syrup to-go packet. The salmon enchiladas were the only saving grace on the buffet spread; even the turkey pot pie raised eyebrows since it didn't even have a pie crust?  Not the worst breakfast I've ever had, but for $32? I could have gone to Caffe Boa or Golden Corral (seriously, that disappointed with Four Peaks) or somewhere with much better food for cheaper! Now, if there were the option to choose something other than the Mother's Day Brunch for 32 bucks a pop, then I could at least say this was my fault, but we were told that was the only option (though later, before 2pm when brunch was supposed to end, I saw regular food on other tables).   The mimosas were okay, but small and difficult to mess up anyway.  The highlight of breakfast was the baked goods - From Chompies. Sorely disappointed in Four Peaks' Brunch.

Group of 9, waited a short while for a table.  They sat us at a long narrow table on the patio sort of like an alley way (not the front patio).  The table was positioned right in the crosshairs of two gigantic fans - it looked like we were standing in a hurricane - no way anyone can enjoy a meal getting blown around like that.  When I first asked the waitress to move us or turn the fans down she looked at me like I was nuts - pardon me, I'm only the customer getting my friggin' hair blown off my head by two dirty industrial fans!!!  My nieces were laughing because it was such a ridiculous situation.  I should have walked out right then...I knew better.  The manager and waitress turned the fans (much to the disappointment of surrounding diners on this hot, sticky evening).  It's loud, not air conditioned.  Pizza was supposed to take 'extra time' to prepare and ended up coming out 10 minutes before the rest of the food!  Nearly everyone in our group complained of way too much garlic in their food - must have been unofficial garlic-fest in the kitchen that night.  Even the balsamic vinegarette was loaded with garlic!  I like garlic, but this was bad.  My son ordered a pizza with meatballs and they deliver this ridiculous looking pizza with 6 whole meatballs sitting on top of it!!!  What the F is that all about?

Upon arrival, I got carded and witnessed the courtyard of CM to be overrun with college students ... seriously it was like those fraternity party scenes out of a movie.   I just wanted to try their oysters, have a small bite to eat and a glass of beer and call it a night. Shared a dozen raw oysters, fried baby neck clams and buffalo wings with Kay and got the Four Peaks Peach Ale. Good oysters, wish they had a mignonette to go with it however but the horseradish and cocktail sauce was sufficient. Oysters tasted fresh, not much flavor to them compared to Olympias, Kusshis or Kumas so expect regular, Pacific type oysters. The baby neck clams reminded me of calamari, not too much sweetness as I was expecting and came with thick breading in small pieces. The buffalo wings were expected as at any other establishment and served with crudites.  Ended up paying about $21 EACH for sharing oysters, 2 apps and a glass of beer which I think is a bit excessive. So yeah, it's overpriced for what they serve.  All in all, would probably come back again for oysters, escargot to-try and alcohol. However, I'll probably go and do that in the day time."}

I don't tell random strangers where I live, so I've always kept a little piece of opaque tape over my address on my ID. After all, my home address doesn't have anything to do with my date of birth.  The creeper at the front door insists on seeing my home address. Wouldn't let me go inside with my co-workers until I peeled off the tape. I showed it to him with my thumb covering my address, and he insisted, I need to hold it. All of the anti-counterfeiting seals and etc. were fully visible, but he insisted. He then proceeded to hold my ID very close to his face and leer at the tiny lettering of my address for several seconds. I don't know if Four Peaks actually has this established as their policy or if they just happen to hire creepy guys to look at women's addresses.  If you have any say in where your department holds meetings/events, try Devil's Advocate instead. They're a shorter walk from all the businesses, only card people who actually drink, and don't staff creepy address-checkers."}

Well, let me state that Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que at Tempe Marketplace is anything BUT Succulent, rather dried out meat that, per the manager on duty, Was smoked yesterday, in other words, they served me OLD meat!  WHAT?  Yes, old meat.   In the beginning... They start off by serving biscuits, and my 1st order was, stated by the bartender was, they're old, so they may be hard. They were rocks. She asked me, would you like fresh biscuits?  Hum, let me think about that? YES!  The FRESH biscuits were mostly raw dough. I did notice they sprinkled large sugar granules on the top of the biscuits, not sure why, the sugar didn't help.   I ordered the BBQ Lunch Platter and opted for the beef rib (1 bone), brisket burnt ends, and tri-tips. The beef rib was OK at best. The tri-tips, going down hill. The brisket? I could have used it for building material. This LUNCH was $16.99! That's $16.99 out of my pocket for ^$#T!@#$%^!!!    I hope this was an oddity and it's not constantly bad... BUT...  That's your call. I will avoid Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que from now on.   NOTE: Their employees were cordial, and manager tried to make things right by substituting foods.

I've been here a number of times and tired different things and for the most part it is bland a greasy. Especially the beer bread. Also this location has a way of making you feel awkward and unwanted at the door. There is always 4-5 hostesses and bouncers sitting at the front talking and laughing amongst themselves when you walk up. None of which seem to want to take their eyes away from twitter long enough to help you. And the bouncers always have a serious authority complex.

Acted like I should KNOW this when it can vary greatly from restaurant to restaurant. This attitude is inexcusable; it wasn't an unreasonable question and I have food allergies.  The dinner was just OK and the meat was on the dry side in some spots. I've had better BBQ at Dickey's for far less money and a LOT less attitude.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I love Lucille's and frequented their multiple locations back in California.  My first visit to their Arizona location occurred last night and it was awful.  The primary issue was related to our incompetent server, Lamont.  After being seated by the host, our server did not great us until 5 minutes had passed.  Finally Lamont greeted us and apologized for being late to stop by and we would soon learn that this was about the theme of the entire night.  We placed a drink order, which included a draft beer and a cocktail.  Unfortunately 10 minutes passed before Lamont returned with our drinks.  Keep in mind that the store appeared to have steady business but was not overly busy especially given that it was a Monday night.  When Lamont dropped our drinks we ordered right away fearing that not doing so would result in another disappearing act by our server.  We ordered a Backyard Feast for 2 which comes with a salad or appetizer selection, chicken, meats, 2 sides, and desert.  We ordered salads to start and were asked if we wanted their biscuits as well.  Of course the biscuits are great here.  We waited a full 15 minutes before Lamont showed up with our salads and no biscuits.  Again he apologizes with a smirk which we learn is his way of dismissing the situation.  At this point we were concerned that the main course would arrive without having the chance to finish the salads.  As predicted, we were maybe 3 bites in when our food arrived from the food runner.  Now we're feeling annoyed, rushed and regretting our decision to stop in.  Lamont after some additional time decides to stop by to check on us and apologizes again which is just infuriating us further.  We also had to ask him for the biscuits which he acknowledged with an annoyed lisp.  In the end we ended wasting 2 hours of our life on the worst serving experience we've had in a long time.  Very sad because we like Lucille's and drove 45 minutes to this location."}

The cream cheese was ok and had an unusual texture. The burger itself didn't stand out.  The beer: I had asked for the Scottish and the Hop Knot. The waitress wasn't sure what the second one was, so she gave a third. That was also good, though all three seemed light weight on the tongue.

I can honestly say I may never return - reason being how your bouncer treated me upon entering. I understand I look young (I'm 24 years old with a baby face) - that plus my height (I'm short) makes many bouncers look at my ID twice. What bouncers have never done, until my visit to Four Peaks, is treat me with intense suspicion and contempt while parading my ID around to five other employees (and a manager) loudly asking does this look real?! Yes, guy (who looked YOUNGER than me), it is real. It's a California ID, as I literally just moved here with my girlfriend two weeks ago, but it is definitely real.  Not that that fact mattered - I was treated rudely and with suspicion and made to feel like a criminal just for trying to come get a beer and chat with a friend. I was made to sign a form, like a criminal, without being told what it was or why I had to sign it. By the end of this incompetent parade I was embarrassed and ready to just walk out and go somewhere else - the only reason I didn't was because the rest of my group wanted to stay.  California ID's are easy to validate. Just carry a black light. The treatment I endured (for almost 10 minutes) just to enter was unacceptable. Either let me in or don't let me in. Since I don't feel like enduring that treatment a second time, I don't think I'll be back any time soon (if ever) but consider retraining your bouncers and coming up with a much better method for finding fake ID's so you don't embarrass others like you embarrassed me. California borders Arizona - one can assume you see quite a few CA ID's every week. Why mine was treated differently than my girlfriend's (also a CA ID) I'll never know.   But buy a damn blacklight flashlight. It's an easy, quick way to validate a CA ID WITHOUT completely embarrassing your (legal, of age) patron in the process.  The fact that I have to be be one to suggest that is asinine. You're the bar. You should know that already."}

We were lucky to have found a spot about a block away so we decided to check out the place.  It was a hot muggy day and we thought some nice cold beers would hit the spot.  We arrived at the front of the place to see about five people standing around at the hostess spot, not one of them said Hi.  I had to say two please and interrupt their conversation.  We got seated in the back and right away the heat just hit me when I sat down.  I started sweating.  No ac, really?  We are in phoenix and people still use swamp coolers?  Anyways I was uncomfortable and noticed everyone was sweating, like beast. I looked around and saw a lot of college students sitting about and thought to myself... geez this isn't where I would go to pick up on someone, everyone is sweating and looks gross.   I know this place has some good reviews but nothing stuck out to me.  I love four peaks beers normally, but when my server came with my beer it was warm, not refreshing when sitting and sweating.  Food was average, typical bar food. Our server was ok for it being so busy, but I didn't get the warm and fuzzies with her attitude. Wonder if this review will be axed by yelp?? hmm.."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "SO disappointed.  My husband and I went last night with our infant daughter (asleep in her carrier) and here is a rundown of how it went:  We were promptly greeted and asked by the hostess if we needed a carrier sling.  I declined and said I'd just tuck her carrier under the table by my leg.  The hostess then had a sub-hostess (?) come over and take us to our table.  She also asked if we needed a sling.  Again, I declined.  Minor annoyance.    What wasn't minor what that she took us over and seated us with 80% of the other patrons in the mostly empty place!!  We were almost all grouped into the same corner of the restaurant.  Nobody wants to go out to dinner and listen to all the conversations of everyone around them when there is room all over the restaurant.  Spread out your diners; give people some elbow room and privacy!  So then our waitress comes up and takes our drink order and that's when I saw that they are asking almost $5 for a mason jar full of strawberry lemonade.  I almost laughed out loud.  Seriously, who the hell thinks that $5 is a fair price for a mason jar of strawberry lemonade?   *raises eyebrow*  Uh huh, that's what I thought too.  Absurd!  So I ordered the 'bargain' $4 plain old lemonade.  (I'm definitely not a cheap ass, but I'm also not an idiot.)  The lemonade price actually made me think of the $5 milkshake scene from Pulp Fiction.  And if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about then stop reading this review right NOW and go rent get Pulp Fiction on streaming Netflix.      I'll wait for you to come back...  *drumming fingers*  Okay, done watching the movie?  That scene was good, right?  Okay, back to the review...  Anyway, the drinks were prompt and I'll just say it, That's a pretty fucking good lemonade. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good.  So the waitress then asks if if we'd like an appetizer so we order a $4 'half order' (the full order was $7) of fried green tomatoes which, by the way, is also an OUTSTANDING movie.   What???  You've never seen that either??  *gasp*   Go on, I'll wait.  Again.  *taps foot*  Back?  Outstanding film!!  Amiright?  Back to the review.  Again.    The half order of fried green tomatoes was a complete fucking joke.  There were TWO (yes, I said 2) fried green tomatoes.  Not only was I flabbergasted at the utter lack of value for the $4 I just paid for that tiny plate with 2 pitiful tomato slices but they were impossibly hot, mushy, and utterly tasteless.  Even the shitty red pepper sauce they were swimming in was completely bland.  Unbelievable.  Should I even bother adding that it was delivered to our table by a different server who walked by us with two plates, looked confused, turned around muttered something under her breath that sounded like they ordered the wrong tomatoes, put it down and walked away with the other plate; still looking utterly lost.  So when we ordered the 'World's Biggest Rip Off Of for an Appetizer', we also placed or dinner orders.  I asked for the BBQ Shrimp dinner ($20) and I substituted mashed potatoes for the cheesy grits (sounds yuck) and I decided to stick with the greens that it comes with originally.  My husband ordered the beef ribs and corn on the cob, I have no idea what that cost, but our final bill was almost $60, you sort that shit out because 'I can't math' very good.  Our food came right away which was good.  What was VERY bad was that my plate was utterly covered in some parsley and dry rub garnish that had been liberally sprinkled around (and over) the whole plate by someone I'm assuming must've had a grand mal seizure right as they were holding a handful of this stuff.  My food and plate was COVERED in this crap.  I scraped it off as best I could and easily came up with 1/4 of a cup of this sprinkled garbage all over everything.  It was awful.  Adding to that the greens were horrendous.  Bitter, cold and tasteless.  The shrimp were drowning in this ghastly BBQ sauce that was an unappetizing blend of too spicy and not quite BBQ'y sauce.  I can't put my finger on it, but I didn't care for it one bit.  So I sat there and choked down my $20 worth of shrimp and picked at my mashed red potatoes, which were the only thing decent on my plate.  I even complained to my waitress that my plate was covered in this nasty crap and had ruined my food all she could do was look at me and say Oh, I'm sorry.  Really that's it?  No offer to get the manager, or replace my food, anything?  Worthless.  In comparison the husband's food looked pretty good, as I looked on mournfully at his plate and looked back in disgust at mine.  I wanted to like this place, I really, really did.  The decor is fabulous and the place is uber cute, but the bizarre seating patterns, the ridiculous pricing for things like lemonade and 2 inedible FUCKING tomatoes, and the overzealous garnishments of inedible, chopped parsley and dry rub were too just much."}

I love BBQ I will drive all over Arizona to eat it if it's good but I wouldn't eat Lucille's if someone brought it to me at home. First off the service is horrible. Our waiter came by three times once to take our order, once to drop off our food and the check (I guess we weren't allowed to order dessert), and the final time to pick up our check. I paid with a credit card and actually had to go find our server to get my card back! Second the food was terrible. The meat was overcooked and tasted really sugary sweet and the sides were either over cooked or in the case of my mac and cheese the noodles were still hard and crunchy like they hadn't been cooked. It was just an overall terrible experience. So if you would like to be treated like a human being and actually have edible food I wouldn't go to Lucille's.    Update: Literally 5 minutes after I posted this review the Owner of Lucille's contacted me and apologized for my experience. He even offered a giftcard which I declined, the gesture alone was enough. I will give Lucille's another try seeing as how they took action after reading the review.

The burnt ends were the most rubbery beef I've ever had--just horrible and almost inedible. The chicken was very bland.

It was VERY dry and not particularly tasty--it was mediocre at best. Not sure what's changed, but seems like it's a different place than it used to be. On the plus side, the biscuits and butter are great, I've always liked the selection of iced teas (including peach and watermelon), and I've always received great service, but when the meats aren't particularly good anymore, and the price remains as high as it is, I can't justify a return to this place."}

The service is fine, but not stellar.  They are usually quite busy, so while the wait staff is pleasant, they are sometimes lacking in attentiveness.

Low and behold we turn the corner and there is an BBQ plave that looks like it is inside a old train boxcar. We decided that this looked like a great authentic plave to grab a quick bite. The decor is fashioned from old school props wiyh mismatched chairs and tables. Not sure if i liked it or just garage sale junk they found. Our waitress comes over and asked it we ate there before. We say no and she explains the menu to us. She said the meat is slow roast everyday in house and flavorful. Looking at the prices we were a bit shocked especially for a lunch menu. $14 for a pulled pork sandwich and thats the cheapest thing on the menu. It came with 1 side and we both got garlic mashed potatoes.  Overlooked the price figuring the quality meat should be worth it.  Our drinks came in huge mason jars. The sweet tea was ok but I'be had better. The lemonade was way too sweet. Out comes our food about 20 mins later. The sauces were explained to us and i tried a couple of them but the werent good. The meat lacked flavor and was a small portion for the price. My bottom bun was already soggy and i jad to remove it. The potatoes were soo peppery that after one bite i couldnt eat it. I love garlic and this taste was definitely black pepper. I dont like to complain and rarely do but i really wanted a side and this was inedible. Our waitress was no where to be found and when she did come by my husband was almost done with his food.  I asked to have veggie instead cause i couldnt eat the potatoes...no problem she said she would switch it out. My husband then ordered corn bread cause he was done. Out comes his corn bread amd she said the veggies will be out shortly. The  cornbread was dry with really no flavor or sweetness. We finish and here comes the waitress with the veggies. She apologized and said the kitchen forgot about it. I asked for it to go since we were done. She brought it back in a box with our check. It came to almost $70 for a couple low quality soggy sandwiches and small sides. They double charged for the veggies and she said that shouldnt be on there and had to get a manager to take it off. Lowered our bill to about $60 not including tip.  I will not be back. Honestly the cheap chain restaurant Famous Daves is better. The price and quality dont match up here."}

The food is decent but nothing I've had in the last few trips makes me say wow, and the presentation of the plates has been shoddy at times. The final straw today was this year's version of their signature seasonal beer, Pumpkin Porter. I used to circle the day on my calendar when the new batch of PP was released and would stock up on it at the end of the season. But what I had today was a very poor dumbed down version of the legendary Pumpkin Porter --- watered down, not much flavor, and not really a porter at all.

The waiter even looked like I had two heads when I asked for some. I would have not ordered the greens had I known that they do not carry pepper vinegar. I'm very disappointed, I just wanted a taste of home."}

We ordered one of the Ribs combo's & before we could get started with eating, a man pushes a cart load of raw bloody meat & parks it right in front of us!!! This was most unexpected for us since I had no prior warning about this. Apparently we were seated in front of their large barbque grill & had to witness this unpleasant sight. To me, this was more than I could take - looks like carnage! I have stopped eating meat since.   The hostess was most apologetic but what beats me is.. when you are ready to be seated, they ask if you prefer the outdoors, an indoor booth or  a regular table. But nobody asked us if we are ready to sit near the grill where they showcase large quantities of raw meat enough to feed a small country! I have requested them to be kind enough to warn their customers - particularly the new one's that may not be well informed about this practice."}

The venue itself is phenomenal. We opted to sit inside and were very impressed with the open air feel. The place is huge and the smell is unique. We were seriously excited to see what the place had to offer.   I ordered the Peach beer and babe had the Raj. Bavarian Pretzels to start and turkey club to split with fries as our side. Now. I put Bavarian in quotations because apparently no one who designed the menu has ever been to Germany. With the claim of Bavarian, I had an imagine of thick, home made pretzels, with a crispy outside and soft, buttery inside. The kind of pretzels I walked down to the Backerei to get every morning during both my trips overseas. But these Bavarian Pretzels were the frozen store bought kind that I could easily pick up from Vons. The only thing Bavarian about them was their size. They're huge. Ill give you that. Also. I think the spicy cheese came out of a nacho cheese bag you'd find at the Tempe ball field. Strikes one and two.  The Beers were good and quite honestly the only redeeming quality about this place besides the decor. It was extremely peach-y which is exactly what I was hoping for. I'm not an IPA drinker but the Raj was good.   Turkey club on sourdough came next. Again. Just meh. It's hard to eff up a sandwich and while eff'd up isn't necessarily a valid statement, there was just something missing. No real flavor beyond the sourdough.  Service. Also meh. The girls were very sweet but they spent 90% of the time standing around with the other servers. Maybe this place gets busy but there was no reason for nine people to be scheduled. The clear and apparent boredom caused the girls to hover over our table. I'm all for sweet and attentive, but it almost became bothersome. Between that and the turkey club I'll call that strike three.   Boyfriend and I left in agreement. Beer was good. Food was food and nothing more. This experience has confirmed my greatest fear. San Diego's craft beer and food scene is untouchable."}

There are good, and even great, breweries in Arizona -- this just isn't one of them.  This location of Four Peaks is near the University, so parking is hard to come by.  I went when school wasn't in session, thinking it would be less busy...wrong!  Not wanting to wait for a table, we sat at the bar.  We should have known something was wrong when we ordered a beer flight and everyone stared at us.  You people are at a brewery and you've never seen a flight?  The guys next to us actually asked what it was....  The flight is a great deal at $10, and comes with a ridiculous number of beers.  I can't say that any of them were better than a 3 out of 5 star rating.  I actually left a few beers standing at the end of the night, the Hefeweizen and the Peach beer. The IPAs were not good either.  I've had their pumpkin porter in the past, and that is probably their best showing.  I can't speak to the food, but look at the photos...does this look like 4.5 star food?  The place is loud, the music is terrible, and the beer is cheap.  I suppose this is every college kids dream.  This brew house was built with a certain demographic in mind, and I am definitely NOT part of that group."}

Then as he finishes taking our order, he asks if we want biscuits and apple butter while we wait... Uhm hello apple butter, Yess please. About 20 minutes later 9 out of 11 meals come out, no biscuits yet. Then finally the biscuits come, so much for those coming out while we wait) and my food comes right after. We still had one person who had no food. I will say I was happy when the manager came and addressed the issue saying it should have come out with the rest of the food. She graciously took her meal off the check. Yes we had a larger group but none of us ordered complex food like ribs or pulled pork. Majority was chicken sandwiches.   My chicken sandwich was pink in the middle and I didn't notice until I got into the middle. Everyone was done eating so I just gave up. Now as I sit here at 4 am, I am wide awake due to being sicker than a dog all night.   I'm sorry for the one star but food poisoning is no joke.

More places need to be like this.  In fact, it reminds me of the Irvine Spectrum more or less in Orange County.  We decided on Lucille's given time and that it seemed to be a good Arizona restaurant.  The irony: we learned that eight (8) of the 10 locations were located in California. Go figure.  We looked at the menu; we looked at the decor:  Joe's Crab Shack is to seafood as Lucille's is to BBQ.  We ordered a appetizer sampler, rib sampler, tri-tip wedge salad, and a bbq chicken salad. While I enjoyed the tri-tip salad, T stated the bbq flavor was nonexistent on her chicken salad.  Go figure.  So what do you expect from a chain?  It does its job to feed you and overstimulate you with decor and witty, though nice, staff and good, live music.  Don't mind the food, but the atmosphere is entertaining.

It's nice to me that you can see the smoker working, and the smoke flavor is present in the food and appetizing. I found the baby back ribs to be tasty but a little sparse on meat (I should have gone with St. Louis style). The brisket is great, but a little dry - easily fixed with a bit of sauce. The sides I've tried are all very good. I just find the price a little too high, so I can't say I'm a fan. $28 for a rib-meat combo, $3 for a soda and $4 for a lemonade make it a good destination for an occasional dinner, but their competition in the valley are all under $20 for similar portions."}

The street isn't well labeled, and appears to be just another residential side street. And after you find the place, where do you park? Even zooming in with google's maps, there doesn't appear to be a parking lot. I opted for the first open bit of curb..which was half a mile away. But I like walking.  Finally inside, I found the place surprisingly busy for a wednesday night. The bar appeared well staffed, but the first two people, who were behind the bar, who were handling alcohol, growled condescendingly when I approached them only the bar tender can sell you a growler. So, I'm new here, and it's busy. But pointing out who the hell can actually help me, or even getting their attention, would be nice. And the division of labour was anything but clear. If you're behind the bar, serving beer, I assume you're a bar tender.  So, which beer to get? I like their Kilt Lifter, but it's available everywhere in east valley. I wanted something dark. They had a stout on tap, perfect I thought. But, having finally found someone who could actually help me, I learned it was not available in growlers. The only other option was a black ipa. I'm not fond of ipas, but it seemed to be the only non-light beer available besides Kilt Lifter, and I'd never had a black ipa.  The black ipa was decent paired with the right food (pulled pork sandwiches with plenty of bbq sauce), and I'm sure it's fantastic if you're into ipas.  Why the low rating? Entirely because of the service. I'll find the place perfect next time. The area looks bicycle friendly in case I don't want to deal with parking. I understand not selling special small batches in bulk. But rude staff? Low rating."}

Another drawback they start carding way early. Most bar/pub/restaurants don't start carding until about 9.

When she returned to the table, she only took drink orders and didn't ask us about food.  Before we could even say anything, she had left.  When she returned with drinks, I asked if there was a drink menu I could look at since I hadn't made up my mind about what I wanted yet, and without even looking at me, she just shook her head and started rattling off ALL the drinks in the bar in one breath, which wasn't really what I was asking for.

Unfortunately, the chance of all those items being good is slim.  Sauces are good, atmosphere tries to be very southern and the menu offers lots of options.

Regardless of the level of busy-ness, I've seen a mixed bag of friendly, polite, personable servers, and stressed out, slow moving servers.  Bathroom cleanliness is iffy, if you consider that sort of thing.   My beer-loving friends and boyfriend love Four Peaks for the local beer, and new seasonal options that always live up to the micro-brew reputation.  It is cool how knowledgeable all the staff are as to their beers and pairings, and several of them have even tried to recommend something new to me, hoping to convert me to beer-ism.    I don't think I've ever been here when it wasn't crowded.  I'd say that speaks equally to the quality of the beer and food, and to the susceptibleness of ASU students who have to go to Four Peaks.  Although, if I lived at ASU or close by and could ride a bike or something, that would improve my opinion slightly as I could avoid fighting the good parking fight.  A little walking never killed anyone, but the parking situation here is a little out of control.    Walk or carpool, try a new beer, pair it with an appetizer, and enjoy yourself.  I'll pop in once in a while :)"}

Okay minus one star for the parking situation! I mean really, how many cars probably get dented because they tried to park in the back dirt lot? I know that this place has no control over the parking, but it sucks!  Minus one star for no AC...I had to say it! It is ARIZONA, more specifically PHOENIX (well just outside) which means AC is necessary! Because there is no AC I only go during certain times of the year, and I like my places year round, with no sweating involved, thank you very much!  But if you can move beyond the no AC and crappy parking, you should eat/drink here! I have yet to be disappointed by the food/beer!"}

A year or so later, I visited the restaurant at Tempe Marketplace and was not impressed. I waited almost 20 minutes to place an order then waited another 25-30 minutes for the food. I understand restaurants get busy but that's ridiculous. When I returned home, I found that my order was incomplete, I definitely was not driving back to the restaurant.  I ordered the sliders which seemed a bit dry with not much taste. The cornbread and biscuits were okay but that's pretty much it. Considering the cost, the amount of time it took to order and obtain my food and the quality of the food, I will be exploring other restaurants for BBQ."}

I went with my g/f, meeting with some family (including a child under 21) for an evening of food and drinks on a Wednesday night.  Now, I know that the weekends get really busy and kind of rowdy.  Wednesday night was quite slow and very quite.  My g/f and I sat down and ordered a round of drinks and an appetizer.  The server was nice and service was quick.    My family and I have been there numerous times in the past with no issues of having my family member under 21.  For some reason this time was different.  I tried flagging down my family as they were walking into the bar.  Apparently the door man has said the only way a minor is allowed in is to sit inside, not on the patio.  Again, this is 100% different than the other ten times we have been there during the week.  When I went inside to find out what was going on, I over heard the server saying they should go somewhere else, like I care anyway.  Wow, that was super rude.  I don't think she knew I was standing there.  Regardless, it was one of the worst customer service experiences I've had.  The worst part is the family is full of restaurant managers and servers.  We all have been in situations like this, which is why we don't put up much of a fight.    Now, if the business policy is no minors under 21 are allowed ever, I can understand if they made an exception one time. However, as I've previously stated, we have been there over ten times with no issues.     I gave 2 stars for the beginning server being nice and speedy.  But I cannot go above that because the rude comments and extremely uncalled for glare we received has pushed me away from this place to never return.  So much so, this is my first negative post ever on Yelp."}

We started off by ordering some fried pickles and they were a lot better than expected. Can't say the same for the worthless biscuits that they only gave us 2 of.   Well then after waiting a bit we got our food. But after a wave of servers went around trying to figure out what goes to what table. Is this their first shot at the restaurant business, is there no order to what food goes where.   Upon getting our food, seemed our expectations were just too high. It was good but nothing spectacular. The food must have sat under a heat lamp for some time, our gravy was dried, my meat was dried out.   All in all I would say go just a little further for a better place with better service at Famous Dave's. The service at Lucille's is just not on par. The servers are under trained and just can't handle the load."}

If this review were solely about the appearance, atmosphere, and attendants of the brewery, this would easily be a four-star review.  But then there's the beer... During my sole visit to this establishment, I tried their flight of eight local crafts, all of which can merely be described as underwhelming. I took my time and tried to savor both the flavors and the aromas of each brew, but nothing really stimulated my senses. By the time I finished all eight samples, I had not come across a single one that I would happily order as a pint. If someone twisted my arm, I might have a pint of the Hefeweizen.

For the first time.   The server did her best as the place was packed (as usual) for a Friday lunch. But it took forever to get the Peach ale as she said they were tapping a new keg, and when we did receive it, the beer tasted flat and lacked the refreshing peach taste that normally accompanies this ale. It was the Peach ale, it was just not as good as previous visits. Maybe new keg? I don't know. One of my CO friends had been to 4Peaks before and said the same thing about this particular batch.  Then my friends ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin- both without onions. They both came with onions. And my favorite thing on the menu- the Portabella Beer Bread had been dramatically altered. Instead of the sauteed onions, mushrooms and tomatoes that used to be in the beer bread, it was carrots and broccoli. I love both of those veggies, but not in this sandwich/wrap. It added a different taste & a crunch (both veggies were in thick, whole pieces) that was not tasty. I didn't even finish it- 1st time that's ever happened.  I'm sorry Four Peaks, I love you but you're slipping. When there are so many other brewpubs & restaurants serving craft beer, I'm baffled as to why you would change anything. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But I guess you haven't heard that."}

I slathered mine with their hot bbq sauce and pigged out. It was good, You'll be fine with this.  Co-worker had a platter with ribs, pulled pork and smoked chicken. I tried the chicken and was surpised how moist and tender it was, replete with a delicate smoke flavor. I wouldnt even put anything on the chicken, it was that good.   At this point, I was mostly convinced that these items were actually smoked and prepared on site, at the restaurant. Forgive my skepticism, but real bbq takes a long time.

Now I don't know how busy it was but on waiter ran pass us like 5 times before getting back to us and it seem he was waiting inside and out.

We evenually had to ask another server if they could get our bill for us. Now they could of short staffed both times maybe but I wanted till my second visit to review this place and o like the place and food so much that I potentially would go back but the service just kills me.  Funny thing , there was couple across from my group which also was just waiting and the woman's face was a portrait of patience and polite behavior clashing . didn't want to complain but was losing the battle.

This restaurant is more notably known for its ribs (based on the fact that everyone else was ordering it) and the price was upwards of $30 for a full rack.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "There must be something in the water. Maybe I'm not saying there's like some Dr. Strangelove Fluoridation conspiracy or anything. Maybe It's something less grandiose, something just barely beneath the surface, common and incognito. The Oysters. It has to be the oysters!  For whatever reason, which for the life of me I cannot figure out, people in Tempe LOVE THEIR OYSTERS. Particularly the ones served from the local oyster house Casey Moore's. Nestled in the cultural hub of SUNI WOFAR at Ninth and Ash, the constant hum of the poorly aged, the tattooed and perma-service-industried are a testament to the ubiquitous appeal of their oysters. Never has an Irish sea-food joint catering to the left-leaning post-college-dropout been so successful at attracting the faux attractive. Though I admittedly am unfamiliar with what exactly it is that makes Casey's oysters stand at the apex of barnacle-cousin potential as the Field of Dreams Principle* proves itself true with the emergence of their salt-water invertebrates, I can't shake the feeling that their must be something in water; yes, in the very water that flows in pipes in the wall between Blarney Stone and kitchen. The Blarney Stone, for those unaware, is the unique semi-functional hardly sanitary piss-mist filled stall that has a permanently flowing fountain of water and patron-pee on a fake rock wall. It serves as the most practical option as it is about 10 feet wide with a back up moat that creeps about the floor so even the most shy guy doesn't have to worry about rogue droplets outing his poor post-fifth-beer-dribble-and-shake skills.  That concoction filtered through SNUS packs and popped zits and dip spit makes its way to the maybe-working drain and from there it goes somewhere, the sewer maybe. BUT NO! It couldn't just go to the sewer, not in place where its urinal is as unique as the patrons themselves - that don't at all look like a homogenous crowd of HTC and Cartel social graduates - we can't expect its drainage system to be as middle of the road as your run of the mill bar, no we must expect something grand and unimitatable.   So about the theory proposed prior: since oysters in their regular form are certainly not addictive enough to bring all those who fancy their flavor to run back week after week at any other establishment, Casey's must be doing something during the preparation of the shellfish. Remember the five expelled beers per patron and SNUS packs mentioned? Well obviously with alcohol and tobacco, two of the most addictive domestic substances, flowing seemingly infinitely through the veins of the structure, I'm quite sure those post body residual chemicals make their way through some fork in the road piping that runs in from the Blarney Stone and back out through the faucets in the kitchen and is then used to boil the oysters! That's what brings them back every Friday and Saturday night! Those literally addictive oysters! Because obviously nobody in their right non-addicted mind would ever fight tooth and nail, or stand uncomfortably up to thirty minutes, for a table where your knees bonk all the wrong people. But if you're looking to find a skateboarder, you've found the right bar.   Vegans: They put Parmesan cheese on their fries so if that's your go to bar snack make sure and order them plain. Also I've gotten conflicting reports from servers about the veggie burgers being vegan or not. They might have egg in the buns.   *Remember: If you build it, they will come? I'm sure something along the unfunny lines of If you boil them, they will come applies here."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Arrived here with my Wife. We did not have a reservation but waited about 10 minutes for the first available table which was inside.  I am basing my scores off our experience in the following categories.  Atmosphere: For a brewery the atmosephere was very nice and closely resembles a sports bar with numerous tvs present. They also sold merchandise in various forms which i thought was pretty cool.  Service: Once seated out waitress assisted us promptly bringing two waters with her prior to us ordering them. She also check back in on is through out our meal.  Food: I ordered the Kilt Lifter Brat Sandwhich which i found the be delectable. Carmelized onions, bacon bits, cheese and of course 3 brats split on marble rye bread. Definately worth the $11.  My wife ordered the Buffalo Wings which was about 10 or 11 total for $10. They were okay to me but she thought they were average as well. The biggest thing we wanted was more buffalo sauce.  They were not sauced well and kind of dry. Also the ranch was not good, actually flavorless (this was a first).   BEER: (MOST IMPORTANT ) Wow, I am honestly disappointed in this department. We ordered the Hop Knot and The Raj. Both were supposed to be IPAs with the Raj being the strongest out of the two. I am a huge Ipa fan and love heavy hops and bitterness with mine in addition to flavor other aromatic notes. Neither of these beers had those elements present. The Raj tasted more like a Pale Ale than a IPa. I will say it was very smooth but lacked flavor. The Hop Knot had a mild hoppy taste but no other notes.   Typically if a Brewery has good beer i will stay and drink many more  especially @ $5 a pint. But after these failed attempts at beer we got the check and left. I did not want to try another beer here. As always these are just my $0.02. The main reason that i gave 3 stars is that this is a brewery and we came for the beer and the beer was average at best. If this was a restaurant or bar and the expectation level was different it would have been a 4 star."}

Four peaks is comfort bar food with comfort beer.  It isn't the greatest, but it is far from the worst.  It was a fantastic place to go after the Tour de Fat in Tempe.... when people wanted a little grease, a place to sit, and one more beer."}

I'm going to flip my baseball cap around and put on some flip flops!  For a real hole-in-the-wall, find a hole-in-the-wall.

If you are looking for a variety of beers with good food, then - as I have experienced - this is not your place.   Positives:   1. Service.  Very good: the servers and bartenders are very affable.  2. Environment.  The place overall has a great look and feel to it, in respect to being a brewery.  TVs are on and people are chatting.  A very happening place.   3. Specialty beers.  Their Pumpkin Ale is AWESOME.   Negatives:   1. Food.  Maybe its me, but I do not find the plates very appetizing.  In fact, if and when I go, I purposely do not eat.   I've tried the burgers and many breakfast items in the past; although I don't recall the specifics about each plate, I do know that they left no positive impression on me.   2. Parking.  Horrendous. Period.  3. Climate. BEWARE: if you go in the summer months prepare to sweat.  Fans (NOT AC) are not on.  It is truly miserable experience; winter, on the other hand, is comfortable.   4. Variety.  As stated in the opening paragraph, don't expect a wide selection of beers.  They have less than ten, albeit their own.  Overall, I would rather drink a Four Peaks beer at a brewery with a wider selection of beers and much better food."}

This delighted my boyfriend, a beer connoisseur, and me too, being a fan of highly rated restaurants and anything that makes my man happy. So we headed to the Four Peaks with high expectations and high spirits. Alas, our hopes were dashed almost from the beginning.  The hostesses greeted us from the curb. They were extremely young and scantily clad in low, low, LOW slung jeans that did not cover their clearly illegal behinds. The place was crowded so we took a beacon and hit the bar for our first round. The bartender, despite a packed house, noticed us almost immediately and took our orders... the only quick service we received all night. The beers, well, the Kilt Lifter was a fine example of a 80 shilling Scottish ale... but the Raj IPA was heavy in diacetyls and but otherwise a reasonable attempt at an English IPA. Hopknot IPA was above average IPA with pleasing grapefruit aroma. By the time we were seated we were happily woozy from the beers. Unfortunately, it took the bitch waitress nearly 20 minutes to take our orders and another 20 before our meals arrived. Food was decent, although side orders were botched... we DID notice the very nice disposable napkins, which were durable yet soft. Some of the nicest napkins I've ever seen of a disposable nature.  Overall, a good people watching experience, very loud and crowded, with terrible service, adequate beer, and generic yet palatable cuisine. Would we go back? Not unless invited by good friends. Overrated."}

We ordered one of their big salads and the two-meat dinner platter.  Both dinners were $$$, but good - the brisket burnt ends and the baby back ribs were  tender and tasty, and the sides were equally good.  It was not busy (week night) when we were there, but for some reason our server pretty much ignored us for the entire meal. She presented us with the check without asking if we wanted dessert (we did), she never refilled our drinks (I finally asked at the end and she took my glass, but never returned with my drink - we asked a passing server and a to-go glass of tea showed up a bit later), and after desert was served and an extended time had passed we had to ask for the check again!  When you're paying a premium price for dinner, one expects the service to be a cut above average.  In this case it was several cuts below average.  I was really disappointed in the service and although the food was pretty good, it didn't match the cost. We probably won't be back until we forget about this experience. . ."}

My friend order 1/2 dozen oysters (its an oyster house) and from his experience the person that shucked those oysters obviously was not a lover of them.  There were small broken pieces of the shell around the edges, and the bottoms were absolutely filthy dirty.  For being an oyster house you would think that would be the thing they take pride in, but not that night.  Then the remaining of our group ordered food and both those orders came out at separate times (almost 10 minutes apart) and one order was just a side of fries.

I'm a big dark beer fan, so I requested a flight with every porter and stout on the menu. While certainly palatable, each felt lacking in dimension and notable flavor--it's as if they made their basic stout/porter recipe and then continued on to other things without further developing it. To be fair, their double pumpkin porter was decent, definitely the best of what we tried, but we still found it paling next to superior pumpkin porters.   3.5 Food  The food complements the beer in that it's not bad, but not outstanding. There's a fine line between subtlety of flavor and lack of flavor, and I think four peaks leans on the latter side, which would be fine if they didn't demand prices fetched by superior burgers and sandwiches. If you're promising spicy aioli, I want spicy and I want garlicky. If your promising pork belly, oh man I want that pork belly. But if you deliver a burger that's just slightly better than an average burger and demand prices of gourmet burgers...of course I'll be disappointed."}

The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple I'll be back with your orders. When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back.

I'm a little surprised at all the high reviews for the beer here, it was Ok but I didn't try anything that I thought was outstanding. I did get a bunch of badges on Untappd from logging in the beers from here though, so that was a positive.  We came on a really hot day, like 117°F so we opted to sit inside like everyone else. We waited in the bar area for a bit and a table was ready within about 15 minutes. Just enough time to start sampling the beers here, but note that the bar is separate from the restaurant, so you pay and close out in the bar before going to the restaurant.  We were seated inside at a table close by an open wall to the outside heat, and it was really hot in there, the A/C wasn't coming close to cool the place down. No big deal though as we were getting used to the heat.  Parking was an issue. They have some parking behind the place in a lot and then lined down the alley behind the place. As we were leaving, some dude was accosting us to get out of our spot faster so they could take it. And we had our daughters with but that didn't stop the profanities - yikes, not fun. Not a knock on this place directly, though it does represent a subsection of the clientele here.   We liked several other gastropubs around Tempe better than this one, so if in the area again I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here."}

It was even recommended by the front desk at The Buttes as a good place to eat.  First off I am 49, but no stick in the mud. I like energy and fun, but if they say good food it should be better than Denny's. I write to save another business traveler the trouble of a horrible dining experience. This place is BAR....get it...A BAR. It is filled with college kids drinking cheap beer. That is the best thing I had all night. $3.50 for Black and tan pints....although a little light on the black. I started with Oysters...Oyster House, right? 6 oysters. 2 of them bad from looking at them. Advice to kitchen, if they look translucent and milky, they are BAD. They look bad, they will taste worse. All of them shucked poorly with plenty of shell inside. Didn't expect super fresh in the desert, but didn't expect rotten either. Had a salad. Not bad but lettuce was wilted....I guess expected in the 103 desert heat. I did eat inside, as the smokers and shitty misters outside made that option for the redneck hipsters that frequent this place. Had the special as a main course. Teriyaki sea bass. Like something a 6th grader would make!! Horrible!! Swimming in that cheap teriyaki goo they sell at any restaurant supply store. Rice-a-roni, that was overcooked to the point of sticky glop. Side of steamed veggies....best thing on the plate...or the garnish, might have been. College kids, or 30 something redneck hipsters, or local drunks. Enjoy this place. It was made for you. Everyone else stay FAR, FAR away. There are options in Phoenix....I hope. I guess I could be in culinary hell here. After all they still smoke everywhere in this lovely spot in the western desert."}

I met my husband and some friends there after work sometime in February, when it was still cold enough at night to require jackets and outdoor heaters to sit outside. We were seated in a dark corner of the patio, where there were THREE portable heaters, none of which were turned on. We asked our ditzy, busty, DUMB waitress FOUR TIMES to turn them on, and she kept saying, I'll have to ask someone to do it. I don't know how.  I finally asked her WHO she had to ask, and she pointed to the dirty looking guys acting as bouncers at the gate, who apparently are the only ones in the joint authorized to turn on the heat lamps. Fine. I walked over to them and asked if we could get our heaters turned on, and the guy walked right over and did it for us. Took all of 30 seconds.   Oh, and it took about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, several of the orders were messed up. And the waitress didn't care. And it wasn't that good.   Can you tell I didn't really care for this place (note my frequent use of all-caps)? And yet it will continue on, because college students will continue to buy their beer and flaccid fries as long as ASU is there.  Ah well. We can't all have as refined taste as I.  OK, as long as I'm in pretentious snob mode, I'd like to point out that one of the reviews of this establishment excuses the small oyster portions because we're in a dessert.

Our service was alright, we received the food in a timely fashion, however the waiter seemed annoyed anytime he had to speak to us. The atmosphere has changed from a quirky comfortable neighborhood bar to a sleek trying too hard hipster joint.   The food was by far the most disappointing.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it.  Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about.    First off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.  The service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.    Now onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries.   The chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.  Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.  Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.  Collard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!  Sweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.  The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter.   One last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.  Overall two thumbs down.  Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Alright, let me start this off by saying that I had a hard time deciding if I wanted to rate this place 3 or 4 stars.  My initial reaction was a 4, but there are a few things that really bug me here, so I really would say it's more of a 3.5  The first negative is parking.  The lot behind the restaurant is ALWAYS full, and good luck finding a close spot on the street.  There's an apartment complex across the street that people try to park in, but you're really taking your chances; I've seen cars towed from the lot.  Next, this place is always so busy.  Recently if I drive by and see it's totally crammed, I just keep on driving.  It's not worth the hassle.   Food here is hit or miss for me.  There are certain menu items (appetizers, burgers, daily specials) that are great, and there are others (fish & chips and the pizza) that are just not good in my opinion.  My best advise is find a few dishes you do like, and stick with those:)  The beers here are good, but not phenomenal; it would be nice to see 4 Peaks expand as a brewery with new beers.  The Pumpkin porter here is just so damn good though.  Honestly!  People wait year round, anticipating this beer.  The patio here is superb; a great place to spend time people watching and enjoying the weather.  I tend to shy away from here during the summer since the building is open and only has a swamp cooler.  You're either melting on the patio or full of sweat inside.  Gross.  All complaints aside, I love this place.  The atmosphere here is laid back and friendly.  Service is always great and food comes out very speedy.  I definitely recommend coming here with friends"}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "A very enjoyable Barbecue chain. A lot of people have suggested that I try Lucille's but my desire to do so had been low. Probably because from the outside it looks like just another overpriced family restaurant. Now that I've been inside, it kind of gives you that impression when you walk in, too. There's a decent decor, but there's also all that junk on the wall that gives it an Applebee's kind of feel. Long lines to get in (mostly due to huge parties) also don't help out.   Fortunately, the food is really good.   You get biscuits with a side of maple butter which is quite enjoyable. We started with a half order of onion straws. Unless you're with a big group stick to the smaller size. Even though these fried strips of onion were addicting and hard to stop eating, it was still too much for just two people. The BBQ ranch sauce its served with is also really good (and I am not a big ranch fan).   Both my girlfriend and I had sandwiches as our meals. I went with the brisket and portabello with honey roasted peanut slaw. The brisket was wonderful. Not too soft like most places tend to serve it when in sandwich form. Can't say that I was a big fan of slaw. Nothing special about it, and the vinegar in the recipe just didn't do it for me, and the peanuts didn't add anything to the flavor, they just felt thrown in.   My girlfriend had the Smokehouse sliders with BBQ chicken. While they give you the option of pork, chicken, or brisket, Lucille's doesn't let you mix and match which you want. I really don't get that policy consider there isn't a price difference between the meats. It's not like they're smoking it up on order (and if they are, there's a big problem considering it takes hours to smoke meat). I guess it's too hard to the kitchen staff to grab from two different places. Either way, she enjoyed the chicken. She had a side of sweet potato fries which were really good.   Like most Barbecue chains, Lucille's pimps its own sauces. The three that were brought to the table were original (the best; loaded with flavor), Hot and Spicy (neither hot or spicy, not bad, just not close to what I was expecting), and Memphis style (I'm not familiar with Memphis style barbecue, but this was pretty much just ketchup). I recommend sticking to the original.   We chose to sit in the bar (open seating and full menu) to avoid a short Sunday night wait and watch the basketball game. There's four big TVs placed across the bar, but someone did a very bad job placing them in their spots. There's a couple of support beams in the room which block the views. We easily found a seat that allowed us to see the game were were interested in, but my view of the TVs playing the baseball game were blocked.  Overall, the place isn't much to look at, but the food is good."}

I had the Blue Point Oysters ($7/half dozen) and the oysters were fresh, tasty, and meatier than those at Crab Factory. I can eat these all day long. Highly recommend it.  The Grilled Salmon ($19) came with a good size salmon and a mix of sautéed vegetables. The salmon was blackened without the skin, on the dry side, and the mix of sautéed veggies needed salt and seasoning. This dish was too bland for my preference, I won't be ordering this again.  I also had the opportunity sample their appetizers and particularly enjoyed the Deep Fried Mushrooms and Zucchini ($8) and Mozzarella Sticks ($6). They were fried to perfection, addictive, and good for sharing.   Service was limited to ordering, bringing food to our table, and bringing the check.

Although in his defence, he didn't know they had one - I took him there as a surprise with no pre-information ... I got a surprise myself though when I found it was only on-street parking. Not a big deal but would've been nice to know from the web site. Also would have been even nicer to know that the AC (if it was running) appeared to be non-existent - it was pretty dang hot in there.   I don't know how the servers dealt with it, although the short shorts and tight tops were probably a good attempt. I've never been to Hooters but I imagine the work uniform is similar.   When we sat down, it was mostly dark except for the lights of the tvs with their strobe effects. It made the menu a bit challenging. The building itself seems pretty cool, but coupled with the flashes led to an interesting comment from MH - namely that with a little tweaking, it would make a great haunted house.   Oh, pretty noisy too - don't expect to have any real conversations in there, but anyway it's probably not the best place for one anyway. The atmosphere is very lively if that's what you're looking for,  Now to the food - good and reasonably priced. The hamburgers we had were HUGE, definitely knife and fork items. I loved the pasta salad , so much so I ordered a side order to take home. Although I probably didn't need to, so much came with the hamburger. Overall we each finished about half a plate. Saved the rest for next time (and probably the time after that ...) because it was a LOT of food. One comment about the wait staff - I know it's hot and they work very hard - but our server seemed to disappear for long periods of time. It was another guy who actually brought all the food and he was fast!   I wish there was a way to transfer the menu to Rock Bottom, which I really like otherwise.

I didn't like their hefe, and their oatmeal stout was pretty good, but again not a big stout fan.  They had 2 IPA offerings, Hop knot & Raj IPA.  I didn't like the Raj one bit, it just feel flat, but the hop knot was the best offering.   We also received a free tasting of their version of a malt liquor.....I found this odd.  It was like an upscale mickeys.  Easy to drink and easy to drink lots of it I am sure.    The food was decent, had the southwest burger, pretty tasty.  The fries were good, they were beer battered if I remember right.  Good pub food.  In the end we ended up there for happy hour and so we got a pitcher of the hop knot.  It hit the spot in the heat, but you have to drink fast in order for the beer to not get too warm.  Thats good marketing on their part.    would go back for sure, but maybe not in the heat."}

Disappointment does not even begin to describe our experience.  The restaurant was relatively empty at the time of our visit. The hostess sat us at a table that could, possibly, have doubled as the freezer. The AC was turned way to low on a relatively cool evening, and I was shivering throughout my entire meal. I know that this isn't the hostess' or the waitress' fault, but my mom asked several times if they could turn up the AC or move us.   The food was terrible. I ordered a full rack of ribs for $26.99 and they were burnt to high hell. Paired with the AC, my whole plate was cold in five minutes flat. I ordered Mac and Cheese as both of my sides and that was decent. My parents also split a burnt full rack of ribs, and my boyfriend had an average tasting pulled pork sandwich. We were served terrible quality food for the pricing of this restaurant.   Our waitress was really nice, but I think she should have noticed how burnt the food was that she served us. I understand that we visited the restaurant at 9:20pm on a Wednesday evening, but their website showed that they take reservations all the way until 9:30pm. It is just really unfortunate that this establishment doesn't take more pride in their product. People go to restaurants on memory making occasions, and a bad dinner can ruin a good moment. Lucille's would do better to remember that in the future.   TL;DR Burnt food, terrible for the price, will ruin your graduation experience."}

My husband ordered the Texas BBQ sandwich.  It was too spicy.  He didn't eat it.  I had the 1/4 BBQ chicken and baby back ribs luncheon special.  It must have been an awful small chicken.  The chicken wasn't thoroughly cooked and the ribs weren't cooked long enough to come off the bone.  You would normally think a waiter would ask how you liked the meal especially when the plates are taken back nearly full --- not so.

The chicken that came in the platter was really moist and good and everyone was pretty happy with their meals (btw their sweet potato fries are pretty good). Service was okay considering how busy they were."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Eat here all the time. Love the two meat combo; I usually get the ribs (they have 3 types: baby back, St. Louis and beef - all 3 are good and the beef are huge), burnt ends (sometimes they are overly burned) or pulled pork. They have 4 different BBQ sauce bottles on each table so you can really pick and choose your exact taste.  Several of the sides are good including the baked potato (pretty good sized), corn on the cob, Mac and cheese (it's plain), and baked beans (served in a nice little very hot cup).   Beer selection is ok, not too many craft selections but I don't think that's their audience and they have some house beers so maybe they're trying to get you to go with theirs. They have a beer flight and I'd recommend it, not just to try some of their house brews but the price is pretty good. They make a good mule (4 mule options to choose from), and their coolers are good also.   I'm a dessert person and believe I've tried each that they have - they are all good. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler. It's pretty large, has a nice hard top crust with a great soft under, nice amount of peaches. Really yummy, and if you didn't save room they can pre-box it for you to take home with the check :)"}

He then goes and gets the menus and throws them in front of us and doesn't even bother to point any beers out. We asked if they had good burgers he told us the burger special (that was nice) Cool patio, fun atmosphere. But the servers are not all that friendly. My coke was flat so I asked for a sprite, the server felt the need to tell me when he got back with the sprite that he just tried the coke and it was fine.. Unnescarry to say the least.

Yeah, they give you a big mason jar to drink out of and biscuits with apple butter to start off. I recognized the biscuit but couldn't figure out what the sparkly stuff was on it, which turned out to be sugar. At first I didn't know what the apple butter was. Even after eating it, I later asked the server what was in it. The biscuit was dry and the combo was not Southern style.  Lucilles has Tri-Tip all over their menu. That made me chuckle because if Southerners knew where Tri-Tip originated from, you'd probably get shot. Stick to your Santa Barbara roots Lucille.    I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious!!! My server recommened the Memphis style BBQ sauce and he was right - an excellent combination with the pulled pork.  The fries were nothing to write home about. I would have wanted fried okra with my meal, but that option is only available as an appetizer and not a side order. WTF?  I went for the peach cobbler for desert. I couldn't tell it was made with peaches. It seemed like a sweetened mass with a crumbly topping. Good cobbler is not that hard to make, not sure why the follow through wasn't there.   I wouldn't mind trying this place again. They smoke their own meats and they did well with my pulled pork. The rest of the meal was a little lacking. If the price for the main dishes weren't higher than giraffe tail, I'd come back again, but sorry Lucilles isn't on my return list.  The staff was friendly and I was able to get a weak wifi signal. Bathrooms were somewhat clean."}

The boyfriend and I found ourselves with a free lunch hour driving around Tempe when it hit me that we should try out a place that's been talked up to me for ages.  So, we headed right over. First of all, parking is non-existent.  We drove around the block and still never could find anything that indicated we were allowed to park there without risk of being towed.  We finally settled on parking on the street out front, but had it been anything other than 11 am, there probably wouldn't have been a spot.   We were greeted and seated immediately, and service was fine.  It's a rather cavernous room with an old warehouse feel to it.  I'm fine with that.  It doesn't seem to be air conditioned, though, and we were relying on heavy duty fans that kept blowing away the napkins to keep us cool on a hot AZ July day.  Probably not the best choice for summer.   The menu options looked so good when I checked out the website on the way over, but both of the sandwiches we ordered were less than spectacular.   We ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin and the Salmon BLT and split them.  The combination of bleu cheese, onion straws and garlic-jalapeno aioli sure sounded like it'd be bursting with flavor, but it was undeniably bland.  Neither one of us could even taste the tang of the bleu cheese and there was not even a little kick from the aioli.  The blt was just as sorry.  Where the tenderloin was lacking in flavor, the salmon made up for it and then some.  Someone was a bit heavy-handed with the cajun seasoning and the salmon just came off overly salty.  I don't remember tasting any pesto in the mayo.   As we were there so early in the day, we did not have a drink, but it might be better to go back with our bellies already full and give them a shot."}

At least if you eat in.... ordering take out well lets just say it left a lot of room for improvement.    When I called up to order the phone was answered hello not something more akin to Lucille's this is insert name here how can I help you?  Ok it's a busy day I can let that slide.   I'm then put on hold (at least they asked if I would hold) for 5 minutes, the gentlemen gets on the phone and I start rattling off my order which he gets down and repeats back to me (for the record it was two 10oz Texas brisket dinners with sides of peanut slaw, regular slaw, corn on the cob, and mac&cheese).... sadly they do not have cornbread, just biscuits... man I really wanted cornbread.   I'm then told my order will be ready in 20 minutes.... I ask that it be ready around 6PM since it's 2:30 in the afternoon and I'm very much still at work doing this.  The gentleman taking my order changes.     So 6PM rolls around I walk in and the gentleman at the counter goes over my order has me sign a sheet saying that he reviewed the order and everything was in order I pay and off I go.  This is where I should have asked for little things like flatware, BBQ sauce, and towelettes.     So I go where I'm going and I get out the dinners for myself and the my friend and that's when the lack of flatware pokes it's head out.... then the brisket... it's ok but not great and could really use some sauce... and cornbread.... the corn on the cob is a dry and bland (probably a side effect of it being February and the corn being frozen), the peanut slaw is good, the regular slaw is serviceable. The biscuits are ok but in case you haven't noticed cornbread would have been better.    I wasn't thrilled with the dinner, it wasn't the worst BBQ I've had but it was no where near the best.   If I had to do it again I probably would have made the trek out to Dave's BBQ in Gilbert instead."}

I said how was that possible when I gave you all of the information of our group. He said he was sorry that he could only honor 1 drink per person from the happy hour menu. By that time all of us where aware of what I was told earlier. I was a waitress and have worked in the restaurant field for years and never ever would I have told forty people they would not honor a request that had already been approved by a manager earlier. Needles to say My family & I did not order one thing from this place and never will. They lost over $150.00 just by my family. The people that did order received the wrong food and the food tasted awful. For the prices they charge I think they should be able to hire people that can take care of you just a bit better then we were.

Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.  Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.  I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.

Both very good' he added.so I go with the tri tip, my one friend gets the brisket and the other gets a steak. ...out comes the food.. Surprisingly mine looks like the brisket along with my buddies, but mine is cut differently. I ignore the appearance and dig in. I immediately notice the amount of fat throughout each cut. I think to myself  did this fucker mess up my order? I ask my friends and they just think I'm talking out my ass but I know my cuts of meat and this shit ain't no tri-tip.

Passes brisket check to friend 2. Now he passes mine without looking. I immediately open to see BRISKET. I experience mix emotions. I am pissed because I Knew he had fucked up And I'm happy Because I just confirmed I'm not crazy and I really Do know my cuts of meat! I notice my waiters name Tad and understood why he didn't tell us his name. I bring this conspiracy up to Tad and he stated  I'm so sorry man do you wanna see my boss? I reply no thank you. Overall I confirmed the staff at Lucile's do not know there cuts of meat and their bar service is really poor. Eat in the dining room and watch out for Tad bc he sucks."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "My husband and I decided to stop here yesterday for an early dinner and arrived around 5 PM. The place was pretty empty, so when the hostess asked us if we wanted a booth or table, I responded with: doesn't matter really, just a good spot.Well the spot she chose was a booth right next to their big smoker that was as hot as a furnace and radiating that heat big time! Coming in from 113 degrees, I knew we were never going to be able to sit there, so when the waiter came to the table I asked (very politely) if we could be moved. He said he would 'have to check with the front desk' and drifted away. Finally he came back and said we would have to move to a table and we said that's great! And of course he moved us right next to a table with a screaming baby. Payback I guess for asking.... Anyway, on to the food... I have to say that I was a little taken aback by the lack of any 'early bird specials' on food or beverages. In this economy even Flemings is doing a great happy hour! We ordered ribs (I had the baby back and my husband had the St. Louis) The waiter said we had 2 sides and I asked for a salad. He said that was not one of the choices, and it would be $1.75 more. OK. So I finally decided on the garlic mashed potatoes and the beans.  The biscuits they brought to start the meal were really good with the honey cinnamon butter. But only 2? Come on, be a little more generous. The salads arrived and they were pretty much the stock salad, nothing fabulous. Then the plates came, and I have to say the BBQ ribs were just OK. Nothing great, and kinda dry. And the sides were fine, but nothing to write home about.  I don't think I would have been so disappointed if it weren't for the fact that the meal (along with 2 large beers and NO dessert) was $80 before tip! Come on, that is ridiculous. We can eat at Joes or Daves for half that.  So....will I return? No, probably not. If I am going to spend $100 for dinner, I can go to the Keg just down the way a little and get a much better meal."}

While the biscuits with apple butter were delicious, everything else seemed to be standard affair.    My friend and I started with an order of fried pickles which ended up being overly salty.  For my entree, I ordered the brisket with sweet potato mash and cheese grits.  My friend had the ribs.  The portions were big and everything was hot and steamy but my brisket ended up being really dry and tough.  After slapping on some more bbq sauce, I was able to choke it down.  The sweet potato mash was delicious and the cheesy grits really hit the spot.  My friend had said his ribs were great so perhaps it just wasn't the right night for brisket and fried pickles.  Boo hoo!  I give Lucille's 3.5 stars at best.  There are plenty of other BBQ joints around the Chandler area that are more impressive and Lucille's just pales in comparison.  _____________________________________________  Side-Note:  I received a lovely message from the owner of Lucille's today to give them a second-try on the house.

I looked at your menu and my mouth watered at all the Southern style favorites you served, such as jambalaya, pulled pork, po' boys, fried okra, and gumbo. However, while I did enjoy a few items here, my experience wasn't too great overall.  We came here on a weekend for a late dinner, and were seated promptly. There are various non alcoholic and alcoholic drinks to choose from, including a few varieties of iced tea and lemonade. I chose the watermelon iced tea ($2.99). It came served in a tall mason jar, with a large wedge of fresh watermelon in the drink. It was quite refreshing with great tea and watermelon flavor. Along with the drinks, we received a basket of sweet butter with light, buttery biscuits (Free, unlimited refills).  As for appetizers, we opted for the fried okra ($3.99 half portion). It was quite a large portion, with a light, crispy breaded outer layer. The okra itself tasted tender, with not a lot of the slimy texture okra can get. It was served with a spicy ranch and creole mustard sauce. Out of the two, I preferred the mustard better. It was made with whole mustard seeds and its flavor and consistency complimented the breaded, fried, okra better than the thinner, more one-dimensional flavor of the ranch.  I opted for the catfish po' boy sandwich ($11.99), and tried some of the pulled pork sandwich ($10.99). The catfish po' boy looked amazing! It was a huge portion of French bread with large, battered catfish nuggets, mayo with capers, tomatoes, and lettuce. However, the sandwich itself had some problems. The bread was really dry and tasted slightly old, and one of the catfish nuggets was still slightly raw. Setting that undercooked catfish nugget aside, I continued eating the rest of the sandwich, to find an unusual hard chunk while chewing. That hard chunk turned out to be a piece of fish bone stuck in one of the nuggets!   I had the braised greens as a side, which had a nice smokey flavor with very soft, tender greens from cooking low and slow. However, as I ate more, I got bits of grit while eating, meaning that they didn't rinse the greens enough before cooking them.  The pulled pork sandwich was better, but not particularly remarkable. I did enjoy the array of bbq sauces on the table to add to the sandwich though.  Prices for me, seem a bit high. They do have a nice looking happy hour and reverse happy hour at the bar every day, offering discounted drinks and appetizers which I might be tempted to try out some day. For now though, I'll be a bit hesitant to try more sandwiches and entrees from Lucille's."}

Eventually, we were seated at a table for four and one of the team sat at the add a chair on the end of the table - looking around this was not uncommon.  They had a selection of ten regular brews and around eight specials.  While intregued by the rasberry Gose', I went with The Raj an IPA with a good flavor.  The menu has a good selection and I had a hard time landing on a something even knowing I wanted a burger.  Ordered the Lamb burger, medium.  Comes with feta, tzatziki, spinach and red onion on focaccia with a side of beer battered fries.  Sounded like an more awesome version of a gyro like kebab or something - yum!  Turns out the lamb lacked lamb flavor - not sure how, but you could have traded it for beef and not noticed.  I was really looking forward to a buttery delicate focaccia, but it was hard.  The top was dry and the bottom was mushy from the burger, I eventually just set it aside.  I'm not sure there was any tzatziki and the spinach added little to the overall flavor which was easily dominated by generous slabs of onion and chunks of feta.  Not bad, but not good either - cannot recommend this item to you.    Beer was excellent.  Order two or three and the nachos."}

I'm often served by a lovely brunette woman with a British Accent, though I sadly haven't caught her name. The three stars would be five speaking solely on her performance!!! She's wonderful.   Tonight I visited Casey's with two childhood friends after being on Mill. We stopped at Circle k to indulge in snacks following our night in addition to a cup of ice prior to heading to Casey's.   There were no bouncers this Thursday evening around 1am when we strolled in. Acknowledging the industry, as current or previous restaurant workers ourselves, we considered we might need to throw away the cup of ice. With no bouncers at the entrance off of Ash, we were not met with this rule however.  After passing the entrance, we headed to a patio table and were rapidly greeted by an apparent guest. This man was an angry brunette bearded sir, who is apparently a manager named Tyler? We were informed by another angry blonde lady at the table of his name upon asking for the purpose of this review, so perhaps that wasn't his name, which warrants my question mark haha. Said blonde lady said verbatim His name is Tyler and he's a manager, good fucking luck. Inappropriate beyond belief but perhaps alcohol had gotten to her head.   Anyway, Tyler began to speak out loud about how we managed to get in with an outside beverage. Tyler was seated at a table himself, appearing to be a guest, with an alcoholic beverage. We were shocked by his aggression and rudeness. If he were a concerned employee off the clock, why wouldn't he reach out to another employee currently working regarding the situation and request we dispose of the cup?   The unprofessionalism of this situation led me to question my loyalty to Casey Moore's. I've loved this establishment in the past but found Tyler to be inappropriate most especially for the management position. I am also an industry worker so have patience and tolerance for my fellow workers!!! Tyler was out of bound enforcing rules while not only off the clock but while consuming alcoholic beverages. His friends were also embarrassing in their energy towards us.   There were various other approaches he could have taken towards handling this situation. I would have respected his concern had it been voiced while on the clock and without the presence of an alcoholic beverage.   This incident probably won't prevent me from visiting this establishment based on many positive experiences but perhaps Tyler needs a conversation regarding professionalism and how he represents Casey Moore's on and off the clock."}

{"stars": 1.0, "text": "My family and I have eaten here a few times.  We feel that the food is adequate and return every now and again for a change of atmosphere from our regular restaurants.  Last night, we had a group in from out of town so thought we'd take them to Four Peaks.  We called ahead and spoke to a gentleman who told us that We are never busy on weekday afternoons during the summer (Um, was he being sarcastic?  He sounded sincere...) and that There is a big parking lot that most people don't know about behind the restaurant and to the east.  He also said that reservations were not necessary because they were not busy, nor did they expect to be.  We were surprised when we arrived and the big parking lot was actually very small and entirely occupied.  In fact, it was so cramped that it required driving backward for a significant amount of time to exit because there was no room to turn around.  The only parking we were able to find was probably 1/4 to 1/2 mile away down the street.  Since I am hugely pregnant and my sister has a small baby and it was 113 degrees outside, our family members dropped us off in front of Four Peaks while they went to park the car so that we would not have to walk in the heat.  When we approached the hostess (who, by the way, is located outdoors), we had to wade through a decently-sized crowd (also waiting for tables).  We were told that until the majority of the party arrived, we could not put our name on the list.  In a normal restaurant, this would only seem fair because customers can sit or stand in an air conditioned building.  However, we were only 1 person short of having the majority of our party there and that person was parking the car.  The only reason he was not there yet was because this facility does not bother to provide its customers with a place to park their vehicles.  Having lived in the DC area for the last 6 years, I can say that this is to be expected in a big city but in Arizona, it is unacceptable to me.  Most every other business has to pay for/provide parking for their customers.  What makes Four Peaks so special?  My mom asked how long the wait would be.  We cannot tell you until the majority of your party is here.  Based on their silly little policy, I guess this would make sense.  She asked, If the person is here within 5 minutes, how long would the wait be?  We were told 25-30 minutes... which is far from what we were told when we called ahead.  Given, I understand it would have been impossible for the man we spoke with 30 minutes earlier to predict a massive influx of customers immediately before we arrived but at the same time, it does seem a little more than ironic that this would happen on this very day within 30 minutes of our telephone call.  I can only deduce that he was being dishonest.  My mom asked if we could wait somewhere with air conditioning since we were there with a pregnant person and a baby.  The hostess pointed to the bar area, which was not an option for us because we were there with two minors.  So, basically, we were given two options: stand outside in 113 degree weather and no shade with a pregnant lady and a baby for 25-30 minutes, or leave.  We chose to leave.  Unfortunately, since parking was such a nightmare, it took us some time to reconnect with the person who drove as well as with the other two vehicles in our party that were just arriving.  It was a serious mess.  Had it not been so terribly hot, it would have just been inconvenient.  Factor in the heat and it became a health hazard.    A little customer service goes a long way.  We will not return."}

I was raised by my grandma for my first 10 years of life, so I like to think I know how southern dishes are supposed to taste. They are literally from a town, in Kentucky, named Turkey Creek. How back woods is that? Therefore, my taste for Southern cooking is fine tuned, but I'm trying to loosen the reins a little bit while typing this review.  The restaurant is cute, the service is fine, and while the food is nothing to write home about, it's good. The hot towels at the end of our meal, were honestly the highlight for me. They were accommodating to our party of 20, and I don't think anyone had anything necessarily negative to say.   For me, it was just missing SOMETHING. The meat wasn't as tender or flavorful as I would anticipate from a self-proclaimed smokehouse. The sauces were just alright. I'm comfortable with saying, they dropped the ball on their cornbread recipe. Those biscuits, though, they get a 10/10. I also thought everyone's flavored teas were pretty cute with the fruit floating in them.  Although it's a chain, I wish there were something that stood out to me to make me say, We should go to Lucille's. - Nothing crazy bad. I've just had better BBQ, in the valley, and at a shyer price point."}

So I decided to visit recently and ordered a lunch dish with baby back ribs, chicken, and beef, with a side of mashed potatoes. My mother could make better ribs with more meat on them than what I had received at this restaurant. The sauces were disgusting and the waiter didn't even bother to give us biscuits even though they were complimentary. I tried the chicken, but it wasn't anything as expected and was definitely not up to par, this being a bbq restaurant. I didn't even try the beef and for three people we ended up paying around $65 with the tip for a very unsatisfied lunch and setting. I will not come back to this place of establishment."}

I went back a year and a half later (so last week) and I don't think I will ever go back! It was 2:00 in the afternoon, so definitely not busy, yet the waitress acted like everything we asked for was a huge inconvenience for her. She was not friendly, which already puts a damper on the visit. Then we got our food... I would honestly say it was borderline gross. Just so not what it used to be and it makes me so sad."}

Which is great when I want to sleep at my desk that afternoon. Like most BBQ joints, Lucille's gives you huge portions. Unfortunately, it's not good enough that i want a portion that big.  The other day the co-workers and I went there for lunch. I hadn't been in a while so I was looking forward to trying it again. We walked in and were told there would be a wait even though most of the tables were open. Weird. But the bar is open seating so we just grabbed a table there.   We started with an order of sweet potato fries for the table. They were actually really good. I do like their sides a lot. So I enjoyed stuffing my face with some sweet potato goodness.  For my entree I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with watermelon. My sandwich was just luke warm and something about the sauce tasted funky. I've liked it in the past but there was something a little off  this time. Luckily I had filled up on fries so I just kinda picked at the chicken.   Oh, the sugary biscuits you get with your meal are good too. So really, all the sides are good and the BBQ is just okay. Maybe they should have an option of a side sampler as your meal.  Overall, it's good not great. Good for a lunch where someone else is paying, that is."}

At that point, I told him that we never got our biscuits, salads or refills. He apologized, as did the manager, who took $10 off our bill. These things then came right away. One friend and I chose a feast for two, that comes with dessert. On placing our order, we told him what we wanted. However, he later returned with a dessert menu. I reminded him what we ordered.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This place was pretty decent, but I wouldn't include it in my list of favorite barbecue joints.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese, both recommended by the server. The sandwich was unsauced, which gave me a chance to try the three sauces on the table. I wasn't a fan of the Memphis-style sauce, so I split the meat between the original and spicy sauces, both of which were good, but nothing special.  The meat was pretty good, but nothing I haven't had before. The mac and cheese was pretty cheesy, but if that's what they're calling their best side, then they need to give it a little more umph, maybe some bread crumbs, bacon, or something other than just plain macaroni with melted cheese on top.  For dessert I went with the Snickers pie, as recommended. I'd probably recommend this to be split among two people - this was a lot of ice cream. It was good and nicely presented, but I don't think I'd get that much again.  Overall, this was a reasonably good experience, but I don't know if it's worth the trip or the money."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Wow.  A lot of comments on this place.  I didn't have quite the variety of eats that others did as I came here really only to sample the BBQ.    We ordered the meal for two, which is a special running perhaps for a limited time.  It came with 1/2 chicken, 8 ribs (St. Louis spares and Babys) and probably about 1/3 lb. of tri-tip.  Add to that a salad, 2 sides, and dessert.  All for $32.  From a value perspective it was a great deal.  I saw a review below that took issue to the reference to St. Louis style ribs.  Please inform yourself before you go all loco about this being a southern restaurant but St. Louis is north of the Mason-Dixon line.  FYI, St. Louis style spares typically refers to the cut of rib (you basically cut the riblets off the spare ribs), not how they are cooked or seasonings.  It would be like someone complaining about a New York strip steak being served in a French restaurant.    Ok, now that I've gotten that off my chest...  Biscuits, salad, and sides (which we got vegetables and the peanut slaw) all rated C+/B-.  While I understand the sides aren't the most typical BBQ side fixins, we didn't want to go too overboard.  Hey, they are on the menu, they should be better.  The salad was your typical crappy house salad.  The biscuits were hockey pucks save for the sweet butter, but I don't think I could have handled greasy biscuits anyways.  Ribs - they use hickory to smoke which I'm never a fan of for pork, and I don't know if they use an commercial electric smoker or a wood burning pit (I'm guessing the former), but overall they were above average.  The babys were much better than the spares.  The spares really lacked a smoke ring or good smoke flavor, but the babys were very tasty and moist.  Spares were pretty dry, which is unusual considering spares are typically fattier.  Perhaps they don't move them as fast and they are held warm longer as another reviewer speculated.  But the bonus for me was the meat wasn't falling off the bone.  Anybody who knows anything about good BBQ knows this is a sign of overcooked mushy ribs.  The meat held on the bone and a good tug cleaned the meat mostly off.  Finally someone knows how to cook ribs and stick to their guns with the doneness.     The sauce kind of blew it for me.  Sooo sweet...tasted like a typical Kansas City style sauce.  I'll probably order them dry next time, and moreso to really get a sense of the flavor of the naked meat without the sauce killing the flavor.  I tasted the Memphis style sauce they had at the table, but other than the fact it was too thick, it had good Memphis tomatoey/vinegary flavor and lacked all of the sugar.  Overall I rate the ribs a B.  Chicken and tri-tip were really tasty.  The tri-tip was a tad dry, but certainly not enough to stop me from ordering it again.  I wouldn't call it a traditional Santa Maria-style tri-tip, but really good nonetheless.  Probably because it didn't have sauce coating it!  The hickory really complements beef much better.  The chicken was probably the highlight of the meal.  Both dark and white meat were cooked perfectly and were juicy.  The sauce was applied sufficiently so that it wasn't too sweet but added to the good flavor of the chicken.  I doubt they solely smoked the chicken, as doing so typically yields a rubbery skin, but they could have either cooked it over an open pit or did some sort of hybrid cooking method to give the skin a good texture while infusing some good smoke into the meat.  B+ for the tri-tip, A- for the chicken.  Finally, the desserts were mixed.  We ordered the peach cobbler and banana pudding.  The pudding was rich and thick and not too sweet, while the cobbler was pretty brutal.  They use dried peaches which were reconstituted, or at least that is what it tasted like.  It was a very commercial tasting cobbler.  C- for the cobbler, pudding was a B.  Overall service was good, and as mentioned good value.  I'm still going to cook my own ribs in my smoker and get a better product (and cheaper).  But for those days I don't feel like firing it up and want a fix, I'll go back for the chicken/tri-tip/baby backs.    All in all, I wasn't overwhelmed, but this restaurant will please most BBQ fans but will leave the true die-hards wanting more.  Ya can't have it all (well, at least in Phoenix).  If anyone feels differently, let me know.  And don't mention the unholy Honey Bears."}

Still, the booths in the bar are comfy and so we had a good time dining here with friends a month or so ago and watching a playoff game.  They try very hard not to be nailed down to a particular style of barbeque.  Of course this means that they don't do anything particularly well but it also means that you could take a big group of people here from all different parts of the country and they would each be able to find something they wanted to eat on the menu (isn't that the reason for having chain restaurants in the first place?).  A lot of the dishes were served dry and then you could add your own sauce - they had 3 different bottles on the table.  And this is one of the few places we have found in Phoenix that serves Texas style beef ribs so that is a big plus.  We also tried the fried green tomatoes and the okra for appetizers.  Neither was very good (seriously, stay away from the tomatoes) but I haven't had either of them since we lived in the south so even a lousy version of the dish is better than nothing.  What was really amusing is how the server obviously had never had good BBQ in her life; you could really tell by the way she described the dishes.  Anyone who can't answer how long something was smoked and whether it was seasoned with a dry rub or a mop does not deserve to be working at a BBQ joint; even if they are only 16, that is no excuse.  Oh wait, this isn't a BBQ pit, it's a chain imitation.  Sorry, I forgot for a minute.  Overall, the food and service probably should have been one or two stars if I compare it to other barbeque restaurants I have eaten at nationally but compared to what I have had in Phoenix it is a solid three, sadly.  Another thing that gave them an a-ok was the fact that they had a really good selection of beers on tap and even offered Micheladas.  I never thought that drink would go with BBQ but it was a pretty good pairing with the spicy Texas-style sauce they offered.  Too bad they couldn't even do this right; though they did have some Mexican beers on tap the ratio was off (it was like half mixer at least) and they charged $7.50 a pop for them.  I also thought it was cute how the waitress mispronounced the name of the drink and then corrected me when I pronounced it right.  Just priceless."}

I suddenly realized that the only thing I had to eat was popcorn at the movie and that was over 4 hours ago.  So, I stated to think about what was at the Marketplace in terms of being kid free and having a decent dinner.    I don't mind dining alone but on a Saturday evening when there are lots of families and dates going on, I'd rather not sit in the dining room alone so I bellied up to the bar.  It was pretty empty.  There was one other guy at the bar so I figured the bar tender would see me pretty fast.  Not the case, I waited about 5 minutes before I was acknowledged by someone other than the bartender.  I asked for some water and told him I was looking over the drink menu, not sure what I wanted yet.  Another 5 minutes went by and the bar tender came over, I ordered my drink and he asked if I would be having dinner.  I said yes so he got a menu.  I was somewhat taken aback by the prices.  I thought it was a tad bit expensive.  Since it was just me and I was giving myself a treat I thought, ok, just once.....unless it is just amazing bbq....you never know.  I finally made my decision and ordered 1/2 slab of baby back ribs.....it's bbq and that's usually how I gauge my bbq, by the ribs.    My food came out piping hot.  The roll that was severed with the meal was flaky on the outside and tender inside.  The cinnamon butter was delish and a nice compliment.  I was never asked if I wanted another though.  I dug into the mac and cheese and it was hot and gooey with a nice flavor.  I got sweet potato fries too.....I know, I love carbs!  Wish I didn't but I don't have many vices.  :)  Those were tasty as well, hot and crisp. And now for the ribs. They were good.  Moist and tender, fall off the bone goodness.  The sause had a tiny bit of sweetness to it that I liked.  The Dbacks were playing the Dodgers and not doing so well so I took solice in my ribs.    The atmosphere here is cute.  Down home southern style and comfy.  They had a blues combo playing in the bar and they were pretty darn good I must say.  The music made me feel better about watching the Dbacks loose to the Dodgers.  UGH!    The service was just ok. Considering I was one of just two other people at the bar,   I could have been greeted faster.  I had a margarita that tasted a bit off to me.  And I felt that was pretty expensive too.  The food was good but for the price I can go other places and get something just as good.  In this economy I've got to save my pennies.  I also thought the service was lacking.  I would not have been pleased at all if I had been in the dining room.  But then again, one of two people at the bar and I wasn't greeted with a minute?  Not sure I will go back.....but thanks anyway."}

Does the owner have stock in C&H?    It was very tasty once it had watered down by the end of my meal.  Next, biscuits.  Tasty and doubles as a hand grenade it you attempt to split it open.  Fried green tomatoes.  Not bad, but could have been called name that vegetable.  Kind of bland.  Potato salad.  I love a good potato salad.  I didn't have one yesterday.  Way too much dressing.  Maybe the same person that controls the sugar in the lemonade prepares the potato salad.  I shouldn't be able to eat just the potatoes and have enough dressing left in the bowl for another salad.  Finally, the BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  I made the mistake of assuming the pork was served dry as there was sauce on the table.  Wrong.  Okay, I can live with that.  On a positive note, the sauce was sweet and spicy and carmelized nicely.  But, it completely overpowered the meat.  What I really didn't like was the big globs of fat in every slider.  There's not much meat in a slider as it is.  Maybe that's why they call it a slider.  The fat just slides down your throat.   Since everyone has a different idea of what makes good BBQ, I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it.  I do highly suggest lunch rather than dinner as a starting point.

Terrible argument because a lot of people's ID's didn't look like the picture in front either. But that's fine, I said I wouldn't drink and they let me in with a mark on my hand. It was getting late and my little brother who's 12 years old started dozing off. Bouncer came and told him wake up or I'll kick you out!.

Today my husband and I went there again because we were hungry and we live nearby. I didn't plan to drink beer so I didn't bother to bring my driver's license - guess what? They didn't let me in. This is ridiculous for several reasons:  1. If I don't drink alcohol why do I have to show my driver's license to get in for food???  2. I saw families taking their infants and kids inside. If this is like all adults place, I'd be ok. But if it's a family-friendly place why can't I go in and have some dinner with my husband without ordering alcohol?  3. I am 30 years old and I wonder how hard it is to decide I'm not under 21.   4. I found a picture on my phone in which I took a photo of my license and I showed this to the gate guard. Guess what? He didn't even look and said that is not acceptable and kept saying that you can't be hanging around but you can do take-out. Is this 21 century? Anyone can wave a fake driver's license in front of your eyes and it doesn't make sense to think that pictures are not credible but only physical ones.   My only conclusion is that he didn't let me in because I am Asian and I spoke with an accent. Unless you guarantee me that you have never let anyone inside without checking driver's license which I highly doubt.   There are so many brewing companies around the area. I for sure won't go back to this one because their staff are clearly inflexible and arrogant."}

Their beer over all is pretty good too and the staff is always pretty nice and fast considering the number of people that come here.  There are a few problems with Four Peaks though.  First off, everyone comes here.  It is always crowded and loud as a result.  You will be hoarse after having a meal here just from trying to talk to the person across from you.    Second, the parking situation is awful here.  You have to park on the street in an area with lots of no parking signs.  This means you will have to park pretty far away usually, and if you find parking on a Saturday night, even if it is half a mile away, you are grateful to have found a spot at all.  No thanks!  Finally, the food here is not so great.  Also, a lot of it is fried and really unhealthy.    If you are looking to just have a beer with your friends at a good brewing company, I would try another brewery.  Since it is near ASU, there are quite a few close by."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "My friend I'm visiting in phoenix area had taken me to their tasting room a couple weeks ago, but this was as first time at the pub to try food.   First of all, try the beers until you find one you like. They brew a nice range and there's likely something you'll love. I'm not really a beer fan but found the peach ale to be delightful. My friend is a beer fan and he enjoyed both the oatmeal stout and the double pumpkin.   I ordered the mac n cheese with pulled pork ... I actually got the mac n cheese with adovada. I guess she was confused by my friend's comment that it was available even though I twice told her pulled pork. I'd considered the adovada but my friend was ordering it and I though we should try a couple different times from the menu. It was long enough before she showed to check on us that I was half finished with the meal so there was no point making a fuss then. I did mention it to her when she brought the bill but she flat ignored me.   The quality was good. The mac n cheese was quite good. I certainly wish I'd tried what I ordered so I might give a better rating. Also, to my taste I'd rather not have pico de gallo on top of it, so if a next time I'd order without it.  My friend had the carne adovada dish and was quite pleased with it. I can concur the meat was tender and flavorful. It also came with rice and beans and tortillas for wrapping if desired. He also had the AZ chicken rolls which he described as tasty but mushy.   If you're looking to watch sports there are a lot of TVs, but few are very large and depending where you sit it might be hard to follow a game. So try to find a seat at the bar if that's your focus.   After struggling to find street parking we saw a sign for additional parking in back. Ni USA how much parking there is in back, but if you're relegated to street parking be prepared to walk a few blocks. Not a big deal, just something to keep in mind. And hey, cheech the back lot, maybe there's plenty back there since we didn't look.   The front bar has a few stools at the bar and a stand at high top along with some shelves of merchandise, and is fairly bright.  The larger bar and dining room is large and dimly lit. I used my phone to take flash photos to see what my food actually looked like.   Hosts at the check in were pleasant and did their job, though seemed far more interested in chatting with each other than actually putting effort into greeting us or especially giving any attention to people departing to wish them well or invite them to return."}

We would love to have a room like the one with the rattan furniture- my grand aunt DID have one like it with a canary too!   I got a Joe's hurricane, it was good. Our waiter, who was also the bartender brought us biscuits. The are good, but not great. They are served with a cinnamon butter, no honey or plain butter, but you can probably ask for some. We ordered a side of veggies which were wonderful! They were green beans, red bell pepper, onion, etc cooked to perfection in a nice butter sauce. They were not rubbery or too crisp, not mushy either, just right! We also got sweet potato fries which came with a garlic mayo, I am not a fan of mayo so opted for the ranch dressing on some or just plain- I like them that way.  The 2 items we got were good, but I am not a fan of their BBQ sauces so would not go there for BBQ."}

I think the politically correct (PC) society it Is getting works. I went to Four Peaks Restaurant in Tempe Arizona. My friend sitting next to me ask the bartender what her name was and she replied Dayjena and I replied also known as HOT. Dayjena then started working at the other end of the bar away from myself and my friends. Then another bartender came over and asked if we would like some food my friend asked for Her name and she said Courtney and I replied also known as hotter. I guess this was too aggressive because both girls decided to stay away from the end of the bar we were at. After we had gotten our food and paid for it I asked it speak to the management and talk to this female manager and explain the story to her. I asked her if using the word hot and hotter was inappropriate and her comment was yes it's mildly offensive. I asked her what would be the proper expression and she said the word pretty or attractive was reasonable. I said so it would be okay if I said WOW  you are really pretty! and she had a concerned look on her face. I honestly believe if myself and my friend where younger this would have not been a issue. So in closing if you are 55 years old or older don't go to Four Peaks and if you do be careful what you say because you may offend the female staff at the bar.  I have described this to several of my friends and we are all going to boycott Four Peaks Restaurant."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Dear Four Peaks,  It's so hard in today's generic corporate driven society to find a place that takes pride in their product like you do, brewing eight varieties of beer on a regular basis and creating new and exciting seasonal brews with the tender loving intimacy that only a small business can provide. You deserve an incredible amount of credit for that.   My question for you is: do they all have to taste assy?  I mean, I know some people like the taste of your Arizona Peach ale, but the last time I tried it I did something uncharacteristic. I didn't even finish the whole thing. It smelled like country time heaven, but it tasted like fetid peach bile. Your IPA, Hop Knot, and Oatmeal Stout give me bitter beer face, but since they're supposed to have strong character and flavor, I accept this inevitability and leave them to someone who will love them with all the passion they deserve. And it seems like your Kiltlifter exists only to get me plowed in record time, at about 6% alcohol by volume, so that's a good thing and means it's bound to be strong like a bull, so I can accept the ass factor.   When it boils down to it, the only beers you have on tap that seem fit for my consumption are the 8th Street Ale and the Hefewiezen. But even those leave me with a hang over the next morning.   Did I do something wrong? Is that why you don't like me? Is that why you feel it necessary to have your beer drill its way into my skull and leave me with a headache the morning after, regardless of the fact that the fancy imports and run of the mill domestic beers I consume at other bars don't even cause me to blink an eye? I thought we had a pretty solid relationship, but since I haven't been visiting you that often, I guess you've had a change of heart.  So I'll make a concerted effort to swing by for happy hour every now and then to share a pitcher between 3 and 7, but only when somebody else suggests we visit. You just seem to slip through the cracks whenever my little barfly mind starts thinking up fun places to enjoy a couple brews after work. (Luckily that isn't the case when my grumbling stomach does the talking, because your food is delicious and would be a terrible thing to miss out on!)  I think it may also have something to do with your patio, which is unwelcoming and a freakin' madhouse at all times of the day. Provided I can get one, those gigantic square tables only let me chat with the people to either side of me. And I'm practically sitting in the lap of the people behind me, causing me to maneuver like a slinky snake just to get out of my chair and weasel my way to the restroom. Doesn't this piss off your servers? Because I'd be pissed off if my job was to pick my way through that maze on a regular basis. Maybe that's why sometimes I get poor service on the patio, because your indoor and side car dining areas have always had the most attentive ladies waiting on me. I guess I have a serious love hate thing going on with your patio, Peaks.  Granted, the food you offer is phenomenal, especially for a place that calls itself a brewery. You have gone above and beyond the basic need for chex mix and peanuts on the bar, or fried greasy food that's on par with bowling alley eats. You offer some amazing and delicious dishes.   One of my favorites is your Southwest Burger with pepper jack cheese and green chili that is positively rockin' with flavor, but the sweet jalapeno dressing tastes a little meh, so I get it on the side when I'm a little iffy about the funk factor of my burger.   You do have one stand out menu item that everyone should bow down to though, and that is the Grilled Chicken Beer Bread. It is a soft pillowy tribute to chickens everywhere. If they could speak...well they'd berate you for eating them, so we'll consider it a posthumous tribute. Or perhaps it's a tribute to the amazing artichokes and peppers. And the sauce drizzled in this dish is the perfect accompaniment.  Also, your beer battered fries are off the hook good.  So at least you've got that going for you.   I'll be seeing you around Peaks. I just won't be singing your praises on a regular basis.  Cheers! Erica"}

I had the cucumber marg and the husband had the strawberry lemonade alcoholic concoction.

Their fries are great...It's bar food, really. There's nothing that sets Four Peaks apart from a culinary standpoint, but most people seem to fall head over heels for the beer.  Here's my thing: I'm from Portland, Oregon. For anyone that doesn't know, it's an incredible place for microbreweries and amazing beer. In the state of Oregon there are dozens of independent breweries and hundreds of incredible local beer choices...  (I realize at this point you're all thinking - Hey, asshole. Stop talking about Portland. This is a review about Four Peaks - I'm getting to my point, I promise)  Upon my arrival in the Phoenix area, I kept hearing about how great the beer was at Four Peaks. Living close by, I checked out Four Peaks early on, and have been back a number of times since. I've tried a lot of their beers, and they just don't do it for me. I like the Kilt Lifter, and that's the end...The rest of their beers I am just not into. Specifically the Hef...It's the worst Hef I've ever had in my life. Forgive me, I'm a beer snob who likes what he likes, and most of the beers at Four Peaks are not my thing. With that said, everyone else seems to be in love with them, so maybe I'm the crazy one.  The other thing that sucks about Four Peaks is the wait. During peak times, you're waiting anywhere from 30-60 minutes for a table.  Positives is the size of the restaurant (it's huge), and the ambiance. It's a cool place to hang out and watch a game, and it's a good place to grab a quick bite when the wait isn't too long. I'm sure I'll come back to Four Peaks, but it won't be for the beer."}

It's just a different type of obnoxious.

THE HIPSTER DOUCHE. These guys with their American Apparel deep v-neck shirts, ironic mustaches, and overly tight girl-jeans are an equally repugnant group in their own right, I truly detest them and the fixed-gear bikes they rode in on.

The place was quick to seat us, but I don't have much to say about the service.. it was slow to go.  We also had kids at our table and they were kept occupied by the various crayons and drawing paper offered.  Meals ordered and experience: Jambalaya - Too spicy.  It was like a bowl of cayenne pepper. BBQ Shrimp - Not too bad.. but a bit on the wet side (?)   Fried Chicken & Mashed Potatoes - the hubby enjoyed and LOVED his fried chicken.  Mashed potatoes were delishish. Blackened Catfish - not too bad.. but the collared greens that came with it were way too overdone... maybe that's the way they are supposed to be?  Catfish was MEH.  What more does one have to say about catfish?  It was spiced nicely.. but it still had the food produced in mass feeling. Kids Meals - No comment here.  Kids meals are kids meals  The experience was okay.. I can honestly say that I felt it was no different than going to an Outback Steakhouse, Elephant Bar or similar type restaurant.  The specialty is BBQ.. but I feel they are the good at BBQ, but master of none.  So it's a good experience for the hubs who likes that kind of food.

Never anything big, but little things that annoy you to the point of now, I'll probably not go back. We used to literally LOVE this place My entire family does, so we always went here with the family for outings as they are good for groups, take reservations, and are delicious.  The things that annoy me, more than a little bit, are how they nickel & dime you with prices. The drinks are all about .50-$1 higher than most places. Nothing huge, but a little small price poke. Not the money, more the principle as it's kind of a hidden fee in my opinion, unless you want to order water I guess. When you are taking out your family, that's an extra $2-$4 right on the top, or in the case of us, over $10 with a large group. My first bone to pick is their lemonade. They ALWAYS offer it when taking the drink order, Can I get you an iced tea, or maybe a lemonade or strawberry lemonade?. Sounds good of course, and my kids ALWAYS want the lemonade. And I ALWAYS forget that it's the price of an alcoholic drink, not a normal, although high already, beverage price like soda or tea. And you guessed it, they NEVER tell you this when they offer it and you order it. I have been surprised by this charge for the last time and will not be going back.   To be fair, the service here has always been good and the food good as well. But in addition to the drink prices they raised several of their other dishes price as well. I noticed this but even my in-laws mentioned it as well which made my decision easier. They have always gouged on drinks, and always been a little more expensive than similar places like Texas Roadhouse, but now that they raised the prices they have priced themselves out of the market for me.  I don't do this to smear them, just my opinion. They aren't any better than those types of places and those places don't have the BS hidden fees that get me every time.

While not bragging, I do drink a lot of microbrews and beers from around the world (yeah I'm a drunkard, what about it!?) and my IPA taste buds are starting to finally refine some. While neither beer was bad, neither was great. Scottish ales tend to be a little bland and dark anyway, even ones from Scotland. So they nailed it with that one as far as consistency goes. The IPA just lacked a little umpf that Stone, Rogue or Deschute's IPAs have. However, I'm looking to come to the brewery to sample their beers straight from the tap, which as we all know, tend to be better than out the bottle. At that point, I'll re-rate as necessary."}

I thought being on a college campus, the person serving us might been upbeat and cheerful?  Not so. Even when I asked for a take out box, the server sat it down by my plate and walked off without a word.    Maybe if I'd had more than a few beers, I'd have appreciated this place more. There is a real variety of places to go to in Tempe so why go back.  Going back to Four Peaks kind of reminds me of the old expression-buy me another drink,  your still ugly.  The server wasn't buying."}

Had to ask the hostess twice for a server. Nothing. Because we had no server, went inside to order. Accidentally ordered wrong brand of beer and asked for the correct one. Told her I'd still take the first one because it was my bad. Bartender became rude a hell and tossed it. A WTF moment and still no server to order food. Left and went elsewhere. Btw, during this entire fiasco, there were two servers and a manager taking a break behind our table."}

One member of our group did not have an ID, and this place prevents you from entering even if you don't drink alcohol. We definitely didn't want one person to be left outside so we had to go back home and get her ID. Most of us were already in there and two of us went back to fetch the ID. When we came back it was dark and security guard didn't have enough lighting to read the details in IDs so my friend here who was holding her ID in her hand brought it closer to him so that he can see it and guess what, he said you are too disrespectful and we can't let you in. The guys here are clearly ill equipped and don't even carry a flashlight to inspect IDs.. This is basic commonsense. We even spoke to the manager but no one was willing to overturn the security guards FINAL decision of not letting a customer in, who traveled all the way from Chicago, had to go home and fetch her ID and doesn't even consume alcohol."}

We decided to get a drink in the bar while we waited and boy did we wait!!! We waited about 5 min, a waitress walked by and said ill be right with you. After another 5 minutes she dropped off menus rushed next to the couple that sat after us and took their drink order and then ran off again for another 5 minutes. She finally comes by and we tell her we just want to Order a drink.  She runs off and this time is fairly decent at coming back with a drink and we ask for the check right away afraid that we won't see her again. She brings us the check and by this time our table is called.  By the time we get the check it took about 25 min to get one drink from the bar....  The food is a bit pricey but comes in very large quantities so take the leftovers home and its worth the money. Dinner for two cost $50. It southern style so if you like that type of food you have a lot of options. When it comes time to pay the check my husband realized the bar waitress still had his credit card.

She was so polite and friendly; we were also sat immediately, another plus!  Then it just went down hill from there. It took at least 8 minutes or more for our server to come greet us, we actually talked about leaving.  When he took our drink order he also offered to bring us biscuits...YES PLEASE!!  He also let us know they do Team Serving there so to quote him, If I disappear or you cannot find me, anyone who works here can get you what you need!  Cool, we are going to have a team of servers, who wouldn't want that?  Well, the issue is he DID disappear, and there was NO team to help him!  After 13 minutes, yes 13, he finally brought our drinks, but no biscuits.  He took our order (Backyard feast for 2, BBQ Sauce on the side) and said he'd be back.  After another 12 minutes someone else finally brought our salads, and I feared our food would soon follow, which it did.  We were not even 3 bites into our salads and our food came; smothered in sauce.  I sent it back telling the food runner it was supposed to have the sauce on the side.  We still have not seen our original server at this point.  The kid took our food but left the side of mashed potatoes on the table, which sat, and sat, and sat only to get cold and needing to also be sent back.  A female who I assumed to be the Manager brought back our food, with no sauce on it, but she made no attempt at apologizing, or building any sort of rapport with us, she just brought it and left it.  Both my husband and I had empty drinks at this point and were left to sip our water...Blah.  Our server came back after we were 3/4 of the way through our meal, not once asked if we needed or wanted refills.  My Gin was $11.50 and I had planned on ordering a 2nd, as did my husband, but not at the end of my meal. Sorry, you missed that add on to your check building.  Needless to say we had to flag down a Team member to ask for our check as our server did his disappearing act yet again.  What's ironic about this whole situation is I had a $20 recovery card from Lucille's back in CA, that location forgot to give us half of our take meal a few months back.  We thought we'd try AZ, I guess none of them have it together and we will now officially never come back.  It's too bad because the food was amazing!!  It's not amazing enough however, to deal with the most horrendous service we've ever experienced.  Management and The Team really need to get it together."}

Service was a bit brusque but, hey, it was a Friday night.  Less forgivable was the dirty table.  The room was very loud but the music was good; and so we waited about 15 minutes for our drinks.  We ordered the Southern Fried Okra.it was OK. If you have never had real soul food or okra, you might like it.  But for anyone visiting Lucille's expecting down-home cookin, don't hold your breath.  It was left in the fyer too long and the oil needs changing.  Next up: the dinner biscuits and apple butter. Also very forgettable.  The biscuits were very doughy and pretty much just absorbed the saliva in my mouth.  Not sure if that was the goal to get me to buy some more overpriced iced tea....  House salads were underwhelming for the price and featured old lettuce, a dribble of dressing, and a whole lot of carrots. Apparently Lucille's knows how to mess up a HOUSE SALAD. Yep, now we're on a roll.  I got the half size New Orleans Gumbo. The top was congealed and was decorated with a blob of overlooked minute rice.  The presentation doesn't end there: there was a curious brown powder on the rice. I tried to smell this substance and discern what spice it might be, but, strangely, the dish had no real smell to it. Stranger yet, my gumbo had 3 pieces of shrimp in it.  The base of the dish tasted like a prepared packet of powdered brown gravy: sickeningly salty and bland.  Everything else in it was way overlooked and rubbery.  On a brighter side, my husband got the BBQ Tri Tip. I helped him with it since my meal was inedible and it was pretty awesome.  It was perfectly cooked and the Mop sauce that accompanied it was a great accompaniment.  A side note: his garlic mashed potatoes were devoid of any garlic, or taste for that matter.  Perhaps another powdered train-wreck: the only thing Lucille's did consistently."}

I have never tasted any BBQ sauce like that come out of Memphis. It should really be labeled St. Louis style.  Also they have a pork sandwich  that you can get Memphis style with  mustard coleslaw and mustard sauce. Memphis has mayonnaise based coleslaw. I ordered the  pork queso that tasted freezer burned. I couldn't even finish the appetizer. For my entree I ordered the  BBQ chicken sandwich and Mac and cheese. The plate looked amazing however the chicken was not seasoned. It comes with a spring mix of lettuce that was giving off a bitter flavor so I removed that. The onion straws were soggy. The sandwich itself just didn't have any flavor once I removed the bitter lettuce. The Mac and cheese looked nice but also lacked salt and pepper. They overcharge for bad BBQ because Arizona doesn't know any better. I invite the owner to go to Memphis and reevaluate using Memphis name. I also invite ppl to try really Memphis BBQ in Memphis. I don't want all BBQ to taste like Memphis but I do expect it to taste decent."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "We really wanted to like Lucille's, really, we did. I married a Southern boy, so as I was reading the online menu to him, he decided he really wanted to go. Unfortunately for Lucille's, we've already been to Bobby Q's and Lucille's just does not stack up.  DRINKS: Hubby had an interesting dark beer made by Albita Ale in Louisiana (although our server mistakenly said it was from Mississippi) called Turbo Dog which had some rich coffee tones. I am not usually a dark beer drinker, but I liked it too. I had the sweet tea which was served in a big mason jar with a sprig of fresh mint. It was sweet, but not LoLo's sweet (God love ya' LoLo's, but you're not exactly helping prevent the diabetes!) and that's a good thing.   APPETIZERS: Hubby just had to have him some fried okra. I tried two pieces to be a good sport, but the interior texture is something I just can't get over. He thought it was delicious and preferred the mustard dipping sauce over the spicy ranch. We were also served some biscuits (which we both felt were also made with some corn meal and this made them a little tougher) and some apple butter which was not really apple butter, but rather some sweetened butter tinged with cinnamon. Not impressive.  MEAT: Hubby had the brisket and I had the tri-tip. The brisket is so far superior at Bobby Q's in terms of tenderness. Lucille's wasn't awful, though, and the mop sauce which is different from the three sauces that were in bottles on the table (original, Memphis, and Hot & Spicy) was really good, and I usually don't like BBQ sauces. My tri-tip was very smoky in flavor, but rather dry. I asked for it dry (meaning no sauce) and was even challenged to do so by the menu itself which claimed that the true test of good BBQ was having it sauce-less. And so I did. And Lucille's did not pass the test on the tri-tip.  SIDES: Hubby had shoestring fries which we both agreed were delicious, and also the peanut slaw, which is a vinegar based cole slaw tossed with peanuts and peanut oil. It also had large pieces of yellow and red bell pepper in it, which made it inedible for me, but Hubby thought it was quite tasty and certainly different from any slaw he'd ever had.  I had the macaroni and cheese and roasted corn. The corn was delicious, but I had no idea it would be on the cob. At Bobby Q's, they roast it, slice it off the cob and serve it in a little bowl, which I prefer. The mac and cheese was an abomination for a place that claims to serve Southern food. I am not sure there was any real unprocessed cheese in it. I have had better from a Kraft Deluxe box.  DESSERT: I am glad we tried the dessert because the banana pudding was the true standout. I have never had banana pudding that has not been from a can, so the homemade version at Lucille's was a treat. It had some pieces of fresh banana and vanilla wafers tossed throughout the large serving (more than enough for 2). It was topped with real whipped cream (not Redi-Whip).  SERVICE: The service was quite good, attentive but not annoying. A manager stopped by our table toward the end, and Hubby made a comparison between Lucille's and Bobby Q's. The manager said that a few other managers had come over from Bobby's to Lucille's, and implied that something was amiss at Bobby's in the overall running of the place. Whatever that is, it is not overt, as Hubby and I never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at Bobby's. We decided that we'll give Lucille's 6 months to work out what we hope are some opening bugs, and we'll return to try again. In the meantime, you'll see us at Bobby's."}

At my most recent visit, however, I was so disappointed in the service!  I placed a take out order of two racks of Saint Louis ribs.  Your server, Renora did a great job - verified my order, no problem. I got my order and drove home. Unfortunately, when I got home and unpacked the bag, what I had received was two racks of baby back ribs. The boxes were labeled baby back and when I opened the box, that is in fact what they were.  I called and talked to Renora, who was again super helpful. She apologized for the mix up, verified that I had paid for the Saint Louis ribs and connected me to the manager. This is where everything fell to pieces. The manager (a woman, I didn't get her name) was rude, tried to argue with me that I don't know the difference between baby backs and Saints, and would not even acknowledged that a mix up was even a possibility. I don't understand her horrible attitude. I wasn't asking for my money back - just the difference in what I paid versus what I got. She was so rude and dismissive, I felt horrible for even calling. She made me feel like my buisness doesn't matter.  I know it was a super busy day - the place was packed, but I don't think that is an excuse for her behavior. Perhaps by sharing my experience you could provide her with some customer service training. I think she could use it. **** I tried to send this feedback to the Lucille's website, but it does not work, so I am airing my disappointment on YELP instead."}

Tucked into a cozy corner in the Maple Ash neighborhood by ASU, Casey's is a great concept for a pub, but they fall flat on so many levels. First of all, I hate about 95% of its clientele. A lot of loud and rowdy dude bros with their low-tolerance just-turned-21-but-look-like-they're-16 type girlfriends mixed in with confused 20-something hipsters, and crust punks who scream for anarchy when really they're still drinking on their parent's dime. The draught selections are average-- nothing exciting or anything but are always served in a nice cold pint glass. Prices are great, but food teeters on below average. The food at George and Dragon is definitely better...and I'd stay away from those Oysters if I were you...boyfriend got tremendously sick from there here once and it was bad. If you must eat here, get something grilled and get it well done. Just in case, you know? ALSO, service can be slow because the waitresses space out and forget about you...and while the bouncers are nice, they're dumb. I have had to argue quite a few times about my ID being valid even though it wasn't horizontal (AZ IDs are vertical until you turn 21, which you then go and get a new ID that is horizontal). Basically, they didn't want to be bothered with reading what year I was born in...and at that point, I was already 23...WHATEVER, BRAHS. File under: loud and obnoxious."}

Last night we had to send back tea for a spoiled taste and the biscuits for a bad taste as well. The manager was super nice and agreed both were off. Then with my sandwich, I got mashed potatoes as a side. And I asked for gravy on the side vs. on top. I was surprised when I got the bill that there was a $2 charge for gravy. Mashed potatoes and gravy are traditionally served together, and our server never mentioned an upcharge. Overall, disappointing experience. I'm not sure how long I'll continue to be a customer if they don't make some improvements."}

Ugh, how hard is it to clear our table of the 5 side plates that are clearly in our way? She WAS super nice though, so there's that.  They brought out brisket instead of tri tip for a dining companion, with the manager barely managing a sorry while we waited. We asked for a six person table PLUS a high chair and received a five person plus a high chair. All in all, service is what brings this place down.  The lemonade is the best part about this place - delicious!  The food. Meh. Brisket was not fatty enough, dry, and flavorless. The chicken was decent, and the smoked hot link tasted like mush in a casing. The mac and cheese lacked flavor. Was it okay BBQ? Yes. Is there much better in the Phoenix area? Absolutely! Bobby Q and Bryans up in Cave Creek instantly pop in to mind...   Won't be back, as the service is not up to par."}

The crab cakes came shortly and it was paired with an aioli tasting sauce. It was really a good combination and I would highly recommend it. It's the best crab cakes I've tried even compared to steelhead diner in Seattle. The oysters came in after 20 minutes after the warning did mention on the menu to allow for up to 35 minutes. It was delicious, but very rich to the taste. It had cheese and spinach and with a spritz of lemon it was just right!   I came during happy hour and they knocked two dollars off my crab cakes or any appetizer and it all totaled up to 23 bucks including tax. It's fairly cheap.   I would come here again!

Inside, the ambiance and decor match her exterior; warm and hospitable.   If only the food was good.  I tried the barbecue chicken sandwich, it came with a choice of many sides...I selected the collard greens. Typically, when one goes to a barbecue joint, ordering the bbq chicken sandwich, the expectation is a large bun with shredded barbecued chicken piled high atop one of the buns. Not here.  Oh there's a large bun alright, but it's there for all the wrong reasons...serving as camouflage for what it's concealing.  At first blush, it looks large and delicious, but if you're a food sleuth like me, you'll want to inspect its contents.  Here are the results of my examination.  Removed top bun. Removed the kale leaves and glob of fried shoestring onions that gave it all its height. Huge disappointment, no chicken in plain sight. Only a large glob of melted cheese. Removed the cheese to find, and this is no exaggeration, a thin piece of chicken breast with a little barbecue sauce puddle it was swimming in. The size of the breast was approximately 2 x 2-1/2 inches, or roughly a third the size of the bun it was sitting in.  Try to imagine this.  This was like the motherlode of all things deceptive.   When I want a barbecue chicken sandwich, I want a huge glob of chicken slathered in sauce on a large bun.  Not the kind of false hope Lucille's is serving up.   Not going back. But I will admire the architecture as I cruise the parking lot. Lucille's sucks balls."}
{"stars": 1.0, "text": "I had a bad experience here, hoping that is the exception to the rule.  My friend, and Airline Transport Pilot was eager to try Four Peaks per my recommendation.  My friend and I had an appetizer, two entrees, and one Kilt-Lifter beer each.  The problem was the service.  -  I asked bartender for the check after dinner. -  Bartender leaves check.  -  I pay the check and leave a cash 20% tip.   -  We are stopped by the large bouncer at the door and the bartender yelling we didn't pay our checks.  At this point, I have never been so embarrassed.  There must have been a mistake.  I have an 840 credit score - I pay my bills; my friends is arguably higher than mine.  My friend an I walk back to the bar to find out where the wheels fell off.  I pull out my receipt to show where I had paid.  The bartender produces a second tab that is unpaid; the first my friend and I had seen of this.  We paid the second tab and left.    Here's what went sideways from my perspective:  1.  The bartender mixed the tabs all up; I had paid for my friends tab, appetizer, and two beers thinking this was the whole tab. 2.  The bartender never produced a second bill until he had the bouncer yell to stop us. 3.  The bartender ignored us upon return, and our attempts to resolve the issue.   4.  The bartender's only comment was, You asked for separate checks.  I did not ask for separate checks.  Here's what actually transpired from bartender's perspective:  1. Bartender mistakenly thinks I asked for two checks 2. Bartender delivers one check that is wrong with most of the stuff on it. 3. Bartender gets busy in cross tasks and forgets to deliver second check.  4. Bartender realizes his mistake, has bouncer stop us, but does not admit to what actually happened for fear of reprisal hoping we will not notice.  We noticed.     Here's how the situation could have been completely avoided:  1.  Bartender stops us and admits mistake.  Stops us when we are obviously struggling to figure out what he did.  We pay.  We leave happy.   Summary: Four Peaks, you wasted 10 minutes of my time with a good friend to figure out where you went wrong to cover your mistake - never admitting fault, treating us like we did this on purpose.  For that, you get a bad review.  I hope this review is helpful to the general manager."}

Lucille's prices their BBQ on the same level of a Wood Ranch so I was expecting high quality meat, sides, and everything else.  Instead, the end product was far far far lower than Famous Dave's (though a dinner at Dave's would have been 30% cheaper for two, and better).  If Lucille's was in Mesa Riverview and not the always busy Tempe Marketplace, it would be out of business.    First the sides:  The beans were fairly bland (and almost cold), shoestring fries were decent, Mac N Cheese extremely subpar.  I had the Beef Brisket sandwich, fiance had the tri tip sandwich.  The brisket tasted like Jerkey.  Worse then jerkey.  I was expecting some tender meat (as brisket should be) not this garbage I could barely bite into.  The tri-tip was good enough.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I'm going to start off by saying, I came here hoping to get some good food and a beer to wash down a VERY bad day, so maybe it was the vibe I put out that would explain why this visit was so bad but I'll let you determine that.  So, I told my friend that this place had AMAZING lettuce wraps because they DID! Meaning, we got there, they said it would be about 15-20mins for our table, that's fine. I buy us a round of drinks at the bar, 3mins later our table is ready- AWESOME! We sit down and I look at the menu and NO lettuce wraps. Our waitress comes, I look at her and said, I'm so sad you guys don't have your lettuce wraps anymore. It wasn't a question or me asking if there was a secret menu that they weren't sharing, but she just sighed at me and said, If it's not on the menu, we don't have it. They discontinued those about 6 months ago. I didn't think I said it rudely but I assumed by her tone, she thought that I did. Anyway, my friend and I ask for some waters because we already have beer. She walks away. Comes back, I kid you not 20mins later. I know because I was texting my husband about the lettuce wraps when she walked away and I looked at the time when she came back.  We order our food, which by the way, my friend is starving so she orders both a pizza and their chicken enchiladas, I order the meatloaf. Our waitress walks away and comes back 15mins later to tell me that they ran out of the meatloaf!! So she asks if I would like to order anything else. I look at my friend, laugh and say, That's my day. And for the life of me, I couldn't recall what was on the menu so I look at our waitress and she says in a very annoyed voice, I'll bring the menu back for you and leaves. That would not have bothered me so much if there wasn't a menu at the little station they have set up with utensils, napkins and MENUS not 5ft away from where we were but she goes goodness knows where to supposedly grab me a menu and comes back another 5-10mins later. I just order a burger because I don't know when I'll get a chance to order again.  The night goes on and a nice man brings us our food. Our waitress doesn't bring us utensils, I didnt need it but my friend had not so finger food friendly enchiladas. Our waitress was NOWHERE to be found and my friends food was getting cold, so to stop her from getting upset, I got up, walked to the waitress area and grabbed her utensils and me napkins.  The food was okay. The pizza was the best. I asked for a medium cooked burger but this was ridiculously well and dry but I didn't care anymore.  We do not see our waitress again until our cups are dry, even our ice had melted and we drank that too, our food is mostly gone and even though we wanted to try a dessert, by this time we are anxious just to leave. My friend felt terrible and offered to pay because she already had her card out and she wasn't about to let our waitress disappear and leave us stuck sitting there. I felt terrible because I truly talked this place up on our way and we both left very disappointed."}
{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Okay, let me be honest, I'm biased in favor of Texas Style BBQ - dry rub before being smoked and sauce always on the side, with sauce that is tomato and vinegar based, on the spicy side. Lucille's, while a well run establishment is more towards the the perspective of BBQ coming with sauce on it (even when i asked for the dry as a bone option on a beef rib it had been sauced and then grilled - good but certainly not dry BBQ). In addition, all the sauces seemed to be on the sweet side..  I will says the service was generally good and the watermelon ice tea, if nothing else I would stop in for a glass of that on a hot day, if I was in the area. In addition, this place is more of a BBQ as a specialty item with a price to match (they seem to charge on the high side), and I'm more in favor of hole in the wall joints like Little Miss BBQ down on University towards 32nd street.   One other thing that was exceptional was the hot link sausage - well grilled and more of the beef with black pepper flavor that epitomizes the BBQ sausage in Texas with its strong German roots.   Look, my view here is based on my personal tastes and I bet there are some people who will find this their complete cup of tea - if you like wet BBQ with a sweet sauce, and better yet, mustard based, this place is for you and I encourage you to get your own perspective. if nothing else a unique place to eat in the marketplace that seems to have a bit more authenticity than your average chain restaurant."}

Average college hang out, little effort on amenities and full attention to stocked taps and bar specials.    I was expecting a generous variety of Oyster dishes to choose from.  Not many on the menu but the basics so I went with some grilled salmon.  It was topped with crab and I got the sauce on the side.  Crab wasn't so good and I pushed it to the side.  The salmon on the other hand was just the way I like it.   Bottom Line -  I did go during happy hour (not purposely) and no one was really eating (except my face) but everyone was drinking and having a good time.  Go there for the booze is my best advice and keep the food in mind as an after thought.  It wasn't bad by all means but it wasn't something I would go out of my way to eat again.

It probably wouldn't survive that long if they had to compete against their breweries. Having said that, they are probably the second best in Arizona (Oak Creek in Sedona is way better if beer is the only criterion). Their beers are consistently OK but sometimes their porters and stouts are a little skunky. Seasonal beers are good but I have never had a great one.  I like the building it's in but it sure is noisy when everyone is talking. They don't have live entertainment which may be a good thing since they don't need more noise.

Its got 3 stars because I think the patio (which is huge) ambiance is great for hanging out. Not a place to go if you don't have too much time."}

It was horrifically smokey and there were no non-smoking patio. Then, we cannot figure out where the hostess is only to figure it out after asking the bartender who advised this unusually dressed guy who was sitting up against the wall drinking a pop.  He seats us.  The actual hostess walks up to us to tell us that she wasn't ready for us to sit as she wasn't done preparing the table. We advised her that the hostess seated us and she argued that she was the hostess.  Moving forward we get out waiter who ultimately took our order.  My boyfriend orders a chowder and we both get one. I tell the waiter I did not order a chowder. He argued that he was 'positive' that I did.  I don't eat chowder so I assured him I didn't.  Btw, chowder, according to my boyfriend was terrible.   I order oysters that were literally warm and had unusual black things in them and we thought they were bad so didn't finish.  I order the steak with brandy sauce. Sauce was literally cold and although the steak was good, it was barely warm.  Also, I didn't get butter for my potato and didn't see the waiter for at least ten minutes so I was done.  I asked them to remove the steak as I was done. My boyfriend got the oyster shooter and saiid it was literally the worst thing he had ever eaten in his life. We got the bill and it was an old freakin' fashion tab that you couldn't tell what you were paying for and what you were not paying for.  We paid and left.  Probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Not a bad place all in all. I have been to this BBQ joint two times and both were consistent. Now don't expect to get a small business feel with a 30 year pit master's flavor/texture/style and over quality at the helm of  the BBQ served, but all this considering, this place does have some charm for a chain style restaurant. The restaurant itself is cute (large), with a few different seating areas and styles, set up to look as if you were eating at a Southern style home (No not a plantation). I've sat in the bar, as well as in an area that resembled a kitchen of sorts (a little awkward for my taste). Anyhow, the service at the host stand is the one area that is severely lacking and overall sterile, they are mildly friendly as a result of it being their job. But that's the extent. The overall service (server/food runners) both times I have eaten there (once dinner once lunch) was extremely fast ...I mean almost disconcertingly so, but hey I was hungry I guess. The server was nice, and attentive...  My better half and I split their porch platter (I think that is what it was called) it came with three meats and two sides for almost $26. The potions would have been too much for one person (in my opinion), but for two it was large enough (there was no waste or take home), in fact there could have been more fries to be honest, they only gave you a handful and I think for what you get $26 is a bit much. Their pricing is high, a rack of ribs is anywhere from $20.95-25, isn't BBQ typically suppose to be relatively affordable (???) and the reason it is often cooked so long is so the tough less expensive cuts of meat become tender and have good taste??? Maybe I am just a Yankee and don't understand BBQ dynamics... Overall, The baby backs were pretty good, the chicken on the other hand is much better, and the pulled pork was, according to my spouse really good; however, on the air of caution if you are a BBQ master and from one of those states that prides itself on BBQ, maybe you'll have different opinions. I will say they have a large libation menu, and their commentary biscuits with honey butter are very good. But I would say this place is a little (slightly) too costly for the quality, but like I said the charm might suck you in, I'd suggest going with a large group (which I will do if I return to this place), you can make a lot of noise and enjoy the sounds of their live Louisiana style band that plays on Friday nights, Now they were good!"}

During the day I've had pretty good service. When I'm drinking there at night the service is really good too.   But there was one time I came with a few friends and I had, I kid you not, the absolute worst service I've ever had. Our server took 10 minutes to even greet us, and then she was downright rude to us, snappy, unhelpful. I always try to give servers the benefit of the doubt, as I am one. I tried being polite to her and still got rude, short responses. My boyfriend and I were eating (the meal took forever to come out) and our two friends were just drinking. Halfway through the meal, I swear to God, the woman must have bumped a few lines, because she came back weirdly animated and chipper, although it was super fake. Still could not flag her down for extra condiments for the life of us.. she would literally glance at us as she walked by and turn away if we waved like she was ignoring us purposefully.   Then she asked my friends if they wanted another round. They both politely declined. She made some inane comment about being on the liquid diet and came back with two beers for them a few minutes later. We all said OK cool, I guess she got us a free round. WRONG. She charged them both for two beers despite their explicit No, thank you's. We were too irritated by this point to dispute so we just left her a crappy tip and got out of there. This place would have four-five stars by my rating if they just made sure their servers were halfway decent human beings."}

I told her respectfully I have seen tables reserved on Sundays and she said oh well Sometimes for the owners we do.  My question is a) why did they inform me it wouldn't be a problem initially?

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "The only reason this place doesn't get one star is my husband and mom, said their food and I quote wasn't terrible.  My food was terrible, mostly because it was cold.    When we arrived we were seated quickly, and a waiter came and took our drink orders. Biscuits arrived and they were tasty, we ordered.  This ends the positive points in this experience.  I ordered a baked potato stuffed with pulled pork and a salad on the side.  My salad was soaked in dressing, it was a lot more dressing then salad.  My potato was completely cold the cheese had hardened on top creating a shell holding the cold pulled pork in.  The potato also had 2 large (visible since I didn't eat this cold item) bad spots that went fairly deep into the potato.  When I let the waiter know that my meal was cold he looked at me like I committed a cardinal sin and didn't even hint at an apology.  My mom and husband both got BBQ combos, between the two of them every possible choice was ordered.  Both said food was not terrible mostly at least it was hot.  I decided to go for a walk around the District instead of watching them eat, since I now had zero interest in trying anything off the menu.  The manager came by and offered a free dessert.  When I came back she walked by twice and didn't once stop to offer an apology.  We were not charged for my meal (since I didn't eat it) but for two lunches ordered off the lunch menu our bill came to $40 which I think is high, especially considering the quality of food.   Topping off our lunch was the 20 minutes it took from when the waiter was handed our check until when it was brought back.  This is way too long, especially since the restaurant was not even busy.

Guess the marketing folks thought that might be just a bit *too* authentic.  The other thing missing? Flavor. Sure, you heap on the sides and your fried green tomatoes are tasty, but this pulled pork is dry and boring, there's too much sugary crap in my cocktail and my biscuit is like a butter-covered rock.   Might I add: You mention St. Louis-style left and right, which I do believe is north of the Mason-Dixon line. So unless you want to argue the effects of the Missouri Compromise, I'm pretty sure St. Louis ain't part of the South you're trying reeeeeal hard to imitate. Even more baffling, your website says the original Lucille got all her recipes from her grandma in Greenville. So which is it?   It's neither.

I get the feeling that Snooze coasts on its great location and outdoor seating, thinking it can just mail in the rest. One of my biggest pet peeves about any restaurant...but especially one of this caliber and price point as opposed to a Waffle House or Denny's...is when an otherwise great server takes your order then hands you off to food runners who make no attempt to confirm the accuracy of orders when they're brought out, which is exactly what happened. The customer is put in the uncomfortable position of having to re-explain the order to a completely new employee oblivious to the original order, wait to eat the corrected order while everyone else digs in, and in my case eat the very dull and lack-luster final product that wasn't anywhere near worth the wait. In my case, I had breakfast tacos, featuring bland corn tortillas, barely heated and snow-white colored hash browns, and a scramble with little seasoning. It's just not what one expects of a place like this which I hold to a higher standard than Denny's or Waffle House, both of which I've eaten better (and cheaper) breakfasts at."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I was looking for a good pancake spot so I invited some friends to join me at Snooze for early breakfast. As a newer location, the décor resembled their other restaurants. The signatory yellow light fixtures corresponded with a good number of round tables. The structure also facilitated a row of stools facing the large windows, and a full bar in the back. By extension, the sidewalk patio added character and spaciousness to the restaurant. Fortunately, we arrived early enough and did not have to wait for a table.  The Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup ($7.50) came with a conventional bread and cheese sandwich, tomato soup, and hash brown. There was a light crunch on the bread, but not enough cheese to translate into that gooey experience I was looking for. For the price, I was expecting better value and taste on the sandwich. The tomato soup was rich, hearty, and had a slight kick in the end. The hash brown was soft and needed more crispy edges. It was not the best grilled cheese, but it did hit the spot.  The Pancake Flight ($9) came with our choice of blueberry pancake, sweet potato pancake, and the chocolate ganache pancake. All three of us agreed the sweet potato pancake was the most impressive, as the buttermilk and caramel flavors accompanied a touch of ginger butter and handfuls of pecans tossed on top. The server endorsed the blueberry pancake, but it tasted rather conventional. I wished there were wholesome blueberries embedded, and that these pancakes were easier to cut into. The dark chocolate ganache concoction was without depth and the least impressive.  Service was very sporadic and not warm or welcoming as I expected of breakfast places. Overall, the food were nowhere close to the experience I previously had at their sister restaurants. The food hit the spot but there was no wow factor whatsoever. Additionally, I thought the execution on the Grilled Cheese was very poor for the price and a restaurant of this caliber. The server also gave approval to a blueberry pancake that was rather sub par. Overhyped. I will not be coming back."}

This one? Not so much. The food taste-wise was a 4 and the portion of my homemade hash was kinda sorry. I left still a little hungry. Adult beverages were a 4 as well, despite the Michelada my Honey got being just a little watery. While the staff weren't downright rude, they're college kids (to be expected) with impatient attitudes and obviously fake sentiment. I can deal with that. I think the main reason I'm giving this one a 3 star is because of the absolutely obnoxious music that was being played. For Sunday brunch, I really DO NOT want to listen to Dubstep, Techno (or anything even closely related) or your favorite shitty rapper talking about all his latest sexual conquests. I hate country music but I would've taken that over the noise that was coming out of the speakers while I was there.

Then a different person took us to our table, finally. Ultimately, that woman (working at 10:30, who was seating people) was incredibly rude, and the experience was awful and we ended up leaving because that one person gave me such a horrible time.

We split a pancake flight and I have to say all 3 different kinds were fantastic! They were light and fluffy and full of flavor.

We ordered quickly and the bartender was prompt.  Our food however took along time to come out, about 25-30 minutes and when it arrived both plates of good were very cold.  It took us about five minutes to track down a different employee to send it back. While we waited for our plates to be remade we were not offered refills on empty drinks or offered another bar drink. The plates than took another 20 minutes to be remade.  I was appreciative that the manager came and apologized and offered to take care of our entrees.  When one of the bartenders came and dropped the tab she said well as the meals were taken care of so hope that made you happy.

Had to wait for my check after leaving my credit card on the counter for nearly 10 minutes. He's capable of good service because he even gave these girls free pancakes! You'd think I was chopped liver or had a face covered in warts by how few times he even looked at me. Don't sit in his section and your experience might be better."}

First the good, I had the corned beef hash which was very tasty and so much better then the standard hash you get from most breakfast places. At the table we also had eggs benedict which were great, and the french toast was some of the best I've ever had. The coffee was above average for a breakfast place, and the prices overall were reasonable. The juices tasted freshly squeezed the overall quality of the food was great.  Apparently there is often an hour wait when ASU is in session, but with school out the wait was only 10 minutes or so.  Now to the aforementioned downside. My partner ordered some chorizo along with his breakfast. When we got the bill he was charged double the amount listed on the menu. When he brought it up to the waitress she got the manager who pointed out a section on the back part of the menu where the same item was shown with the increased price, then attempted to explain why sometimes it costs more and sometimes it cost less. When he pointed out there was nothing on the menu to indicate one vs the other we got a big eye-roll, shrug and the manager left without another word. It was only a difference of a couple dollars on a 60 dollar tab and an easy fix for the manager but the blow off left us annoyed and unlikely to come back, despite the quality of the food."}

It came out about 10 mins later and was much better than what I originally recieved. I was charged for both my meal and the side which ended up costing over 15 dollars.

For the price there needs to be a better meal put in front of me. If I come back I am trying something else because all the other people at my table had ample portions, so much to the point they could not finish their food.  The coffee, man, what the heck? For a coffee they tout they have gone to great lengths to assure the integrity of it is about as flavorful as a cup of Folgers. One of the biggest disappointments for me in a breakfast spot is the lack of attention to the coffee and how it compliments the food. This coffee is simply not there.  The service was spot on. Great staff that were energetic and accommodating. I am positively impressed with their care and attention to detail.

SHANNON was very rude in her delivery of the news and never apologized or recognized the error in their lack of hospitality. The new waitress more than made up for the rudeness of SHANNON and our meal was delicious. However, the incident in moving our party of 5 hung over our meal.   Another authoritative member of the staff did bring a complimentary plate of pancakes that we were not terribly interested in having since 4 out of 5 of our party had already ordered pancakes.

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "After having been to Snooze AM in Tempe twice, my verdict is that it leaves much to be desired.  The first experience I had was absolutely horrible. We waited for about half an hour and were seated on the patio. Although the weather was okay, it got hot really quick since there was absolutely no shade. There were dogs on the patio which is fine, but what did not sit well with me was that the waiters were picking them up and then delivering food to tables. The dog that was at the table right next to ours was small & not trained as he kept peeing on the ground. Like I said, one of the waitresses kept picking him up & playing with him while serving tables. Complete turnoff!  On top of that, the food we got wasn't impressive. My date got the breakfast burrito & I got the omelette with spinach, mushrooms, & cheese. I ordered white bread and not once, but twice, our waitress brought me sourdough! We aren't pleased with any of it.  The second time I went, it was with a large group & we opted to get a table inside. The wait time was horribly long but we knew that would most likely be the case. The service was spot on. Our waitress was great in getting us everything we needed, kept our cups refilled, etc. The food was much better. I got the Benny Duo with the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman which came with hash browns. The Benny's were just okay - the Bella was better than the other one, but the prosciutto has a weird taste as did the salmon lox. Keep in mine their hash browns aren't of the crispy variety.  I will have to give it up for the pancakes that we received to share! The Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was one of the best things I did ever have! There were chunks of pineapple cooked inside the pancake which was topped with a vanilla sauce & cinnamon butter. I would highly recommend this!!! If you're a fan of peanut butter, try the peanut butter cup pancake! The flight is really sweet so if you're looking for something a little bit less sweet, try the French toast!  I think I'll be returning to Snooze for the pancakes and perhaps the French toast ..

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I've been to the other one in Gilbert, but this one is quite a different feel. I think it might habe to do with the location being on ASU's campus, so it's a bit collegey. The decor is cute and classy but it definitely caters more to a college scene.  My friend at for breakfast at 8am and it was about 80% occupied for the indoor seating. No one was out on the patio seating area as yet because it was a tad too chilly still. By the time we left though, the line was out the door onto the sidewalk at almost 10am.  I ordered the Benny duo (one of each type of eggs benedict) with the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Chili Verde Benedict with pulled pork. So the chili sauced tortilla that they had as the bread for the Chili Verde Benedict was very different, but I wasn't too sold on it. It might be the texture or the corn tortilla flavor overpowering the rest of the benedict... it wasn't a hit for me. The hollandaise, egg and pulled pork though were pretty good. For the Bella! Bella! Benny, the slice of ciabata bread it came on was so thin and just underwhelming. The prosciutto, egg and hollandaise sauce again were spot on. But with how salty prosciutto is, I felt like there should be a more hearty piece/type of bread to balance out that natural saltiness of the prosciutto.   The meal came with hash browns which to me was the only perfect (for me) item on my plate. The outside brown and crisp on the outside, moist and cooked just right on the inside. My other complaint is that they neither have blue cheese dressing nor ranch dressing/dipping sauce, and those are my sauces of choice for potatoes (I don'tlike ketchup).  Another thing is Snooze changes their menu, but it always has a lot of similarities to the one before. It's like they remix items that are on the menu. They have a lot of great ideas and sometimes they're great (like their fall menu was) and sometimes they fall short - like the current menu."}

Good thing to know if you're looking for a parking spot.  Pretty nice area and location. We had a group of 10, divide the group into 5 and 5 for seating, as It was a faster waiting time. It did take at least 50 minutes to an hour of waiting, and this was around 12pm.   Luckily we were seated into booth next to each other, even though it was back-to-back. Server and waitress were all friendly and pretty attentive.  For food, I had the snooze breakfast burrito. The burrito had hash brown, beans, eggs, and I decided to add in the chicken meat, which cost additional $1 or something I believe. Everything was topped off with tomatoes and their green chili sauce. What I didn't like about the burrito, was there was way too much hash brown in the burrito, which does fill you up, but I wish there was something else inside the burrito. Definitely wanted more chicken in the burrito, but maybe a few bites had a little bit more chicken.  Burrito overall was just okay, nothing special. Also the burrito was a little dry. I had to use their table green chili sauce for additional sauciness. And ketchup for the hash brown, wish I dissected it out.   But if you're hungry, the burrito will feel you up for sure. I only finished just a little over half of the burrito.  Pricing was around $13.   They do have inside and outside restroom.  Also when you are waiting, there is a person on the patio making mimosa and drinks for you while you wait. which is a nice touch. There is also a ping pong table outside.  --- I was able to try one of their pancakes as well. Not sure what type of pancake it was. But the pancake had a cinnamon / some caramel / mostly butterscotch syrup on the pancake. With a brown sugar butter cream on top. The pancake was actually pretty delicious. Would probably recommend having their sweet or pancakes, as opposed to the burrito for sure.   Also it is ridiculous that a single pancake cost $4.75.   Would I come back to snooze? If there wasn't a wait, maybe. But I will probably check out other breakfast/brunch places first before coming back to snooze. Their pancake was good though."}

I'm also not a fan of overly-dressed up hash browns (Snooze's include onions and spices which can be somewhat overwhelming, if I remember correctly. Honestly, it could have just been the day we went.). That's not to say that their hash browns are bad (they definitely aren't!), I'm just more of a purist when it comes to my potatoes.

It's right on ASU's campus so many college students can come here. If you're in the mood for sweet pancakes, it's a good place. Any other type of home cooked breakfast food is a no."}

He prefers Butters breakfast (located in Scottsdale) over Snooze.  Our server did not come to table often enough. We had to waive to get her attention. At a place so busy I would assume they would want to turnover the tables quick so it would make sense to come to table often to check up on guests.   Additional information: We came around 1030AM on a Sunday and street parking was easy to find. The wait was about 45 minutes."}

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "I am sort of torn between two or three stars. I have had really great service and meals here that I would rate as four or five stars, yet I have also had around the same number of experiences that were pretty awful.  If you come here on one of the good days, you can expect great breakfast food for a somewhat higher than average cost. Although, when they are on point the prices are completely worth it for the meal.   Be warned though, when they fall short of loose dining standards, your experience can be very negative. I'm not sure if they have off days or times or what, but if you are unfortunate enough to come on one of those days here is what you can expect (and what has happened to me several times now): a server whom is either incompetent or rude (they read the same sometimes), wrong or missing items when you receive your meal, undercooked or overcooked food (ex. Bacon can be slimy and transparent or burnt black and hard), an empty water and coffee cup the entire time you are there, and an overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction when you just spent $30 on a breakfast that Denny's could've put to shame for $5.   All in all, try this place out. When they do things right this place is awesome. Just be weary of those off times."}

And it was amazing but at the orig location the servers could handle the huge crowds . not so much here. Ive been here twice and I expect a wait but both times clearly service is so slow that tables are not being turned quick enough and that causes the wait to be longer then it needs to be . I should not have to wait 10 minutes for a drink and 40 minutes for eggs. Im normally pretty generous when it comes to wait staff. But just have been let down to much here."}

I will say this, sometimes I get a four star experience (food is good and service is helpful and prompt) while during other visits the experience is one star or less (food is good but service is horrible [non existent] and very slow).  When I visit during the week, the service is great. The servers are helpful and I always have water in my glass (a marker of good service). The food is also usually very prompt. During the weekends, the servers are friendly (when they are there) but they don't come back and sometimes mix up your order.  All in all, the food is always reliably good and often very rich. However, the service can be good or bad depending on the day of the week. I suggest going during the week when there are less people while during the weekend there are long waits and spotty service.  For lack of constituency of experience, I give two stars.  Things I've had: 3 Eggs Any Style (Made my order perfect) Breakfast Pot Pie (very very very rich, lots of cream) Snooze Breakfast Burrito (my favorite, large burrito and the flavor is very universally appealing) Green Eggs 'n Hamwich (Delicious) Sister Fig's French Toast (too sweet) Fall Greens (lovely light meal) House Coffee (not strong coffee) Choice Mimosa(for me YES!)"}

The manager(?) goes and tells the hostess that it will take longer than 15-20 minutes for people to be seated, but after he walks away, she continues to tell people it will be a 15-20 minute wait. We sit down, and by now, we're starving and really angry that we're going to miss the REI garage sale because of the situation.

I could tell he had been keeping an eye on most of the tables in the restaurant as we all were waiting a really long time for our food.

The hash browns were bland and undercooked, and definitely came from the freezer. What a disappointment.

It took quite awhile to get a waitress over for our drink orders, and this lady was NOT happy. Couldn't crack a smile to even fake it. So that was a bummer. After about 20 minutes, the food came out. The food was pretty good, I'm missing where all of the rave food reviews are coming from, but I don't doubt that other items on the menu are fabulous. I got the eggs benedict (one traditional style and the other Bunny! Bunny! Benni I believe it was called, which had shaved prosciutto, arugula, balsamic...I was not blown away by any of it.

It's just disrespectful. Then the food finally came out and my girlfriends eggs weren't cooked all the way it was absolutely disgusting. I go to the snooze in Gilbert all the time and it's amazing. I had to go to work after we ate so we went to the Tempe location because it's closer to my job and it was a huge mistake... I paid 40 bucks to be ignored the whole time, have lemons thrown towards me, and for my gf to not even eat.

We waited a good 10-15 min before we had to ask a waiter to get some service.  We saw at least 2 other tables that came after us that were served before us.  Anyway, the waiter apologized and offered to give each of us a free pancake.  Overall, the service was good once you can get their attention.  Keep in mind, the place is only 1/2 full, and there were plenty of servers walking around, so I'm not sure what the excuse would be.    Food wise, my friend got the omelet and I got the hash beef.  As these are simple breakfast items, it's really hard to mess them up.  I think it's because we were short on time, the speed of the service was certainly lacking.  By the time we got our bill, we had to wait another 5 min before our bill was pick up by our waiter.  Granted, we probably should have told him in advance that we were limited on time, but the fact the place is not that busy, we didn't think it would matter.   Bottom line is that the service was good indeed, just the speed of the service could have been better.

Tip: If you have more than four in your party you might go elsewhere.    Tip for the management: If you have more attentive servers you'll speed along the dining and cut down the waiting time for other patrons.

I was fairly unimpressed by the corned beef hash, it was fairly unoriginal. The beef was masked by the potatoes, and the portion was super small.

The pancakes and toppings was lightly coated and everything tasted balanced.   I also order the Huevos Rancheros. I wasn't impressed. It was 2 pieces of corn tortilla, Rachero sauce on top with some sliced sausage and egg whites. I'd stick with the signature pancakes because they are awesome. I also didn't like how ice coffee wasn't free refills because it's cold brew but yet hot coffee is free refills. The ice was filled to the brim probably only giving me about 6oz of actual cold brew coffee. It was a rip off. They should charge a little extra for unlimited refills.

I have had bad experiences here before with under cooked eggs and just weird guy servers who sit down next to you to take your order but it's just so close to home and school that I keep finding myself going there out of convenience but never again, not after being sick for food that is not even appetizing.  Bottom line is, the food is not good, the service is trash, there is almost always a ridiculous wait which still perplexes me, I would not recommend this place to any one, and honestly, if you don't offer Frank's Red Hot as one of your hot sauces you are already a garbage establishment.  Snooze, when you read this, please leave this location so something better can come in and use the spot. Thanks for nothing."}

The two things that were very bad - coffee and a choice of music. Coffee was watery and disgusting. Neither cream nor sugar could rescue it. Terrible music of a style I'm unfamiliar with was blasting precluding is from talking in comfortable tones of voice and forcing waiters to squat next to tables.

I knew it was going to be impossible to get a table but my friend and I really wanted to try this place out since she came in from California. There was a 45 min wait and I said first available is fine. We sat outside in the blistering heat waiting patiently. One of the servers that was outside asked us if we wanted water because he knew we had been waiting for awhile. Tons of parties kept coming and going. Then I noticed we still haven't been called so I went and checked. The girl upfront I can tell was flustered and had a attitude for me asking. When I said my name she kept looking for it and I noticed 4 parties behind us with the same amount of people were sat and had their food. That pissed me off and then to top it off a guy comes up and said well we can do first available. Funny to think I thought I was waiting for that. Then he hits me with it will another 20 more mins. I said again I have to wait after 45 mins and the girl said well there's a table outside in the corner. Clearly they don't know what first come means. We ended up getting the sweet server who offered us water and he was very quick with getting everything out in a timely manner.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Really surprised by the nearly 5-star review.  Ignoring the spotty service that we received, I give this place a 2.5-star rating, not needing extraordinary measures to come back but really, really hesitant to.  And that's just based on the food.  Ordered the Benny Duo with a ham and chile verde benedict.  Also ordered a side of bacon, chicken sausage, a side of eggs, and a chocolate chip pancake.  The Benny Duo comes with a side of hash browns.  They have apparently changed the way they serve has browns here.  They used to be scattered on the grill, now they come from a cylindrical mold.  Makes for more space on the flattop to cook other stuff, but also leads to no crispiness at all in the hash browns.  The top of my hash browns were just barely browned and what was in the middle was cooked through but on the mushy side.  The side of bacon was marginally saved by the fact that they use well-sourced, thick-cut bacon - but not crisped at all.  Limp and greasy all the way through except the last bite of the last piece.   The ham benedict was superior to the chile verde.  The chile verde comes with pulled pork on a tiny stack of green chile tortillas.  Very little green chile flavor coming through.  The pulled pork was moist but lacked flavor.  To their credit, both eggs were well poached.  The ham benedict would have been pretty perfect but for the hollandaise, which was way too thick and lacked tanginess/citrus.  I'm sure that sauce will never break but it's not a good hollandaise.  My wife was also disappointed with her chicken sausage (which is a patty, not in a casing) and her chocolate chip pancake, and I concur.  Pancake was not fluffy, lacked butter, with the chocolate chips being the only thing going for it.  And they would have been better off serving a pounded out piece of chicken breast instead of the chicken sausage patty that they served - which had marginally more flavor and was dry.  A paillard wouldn't have required them to grind down chicken meat in the first place and it would probably taste better.    The atmosphere is quite nice, it's trendy, and staff was friendly - but that didn't make up for the mediocre food that got.  Again, 2.5 stars, would have been showing 3 if service were more even."}

Ate one taco, decided to take the rest to go, and while boxing up my pico on my taco I noticed a big black hair.

The other was ordered with green chile - equally lacking in flavor but better than the ranchero.   The green chile burrito was also ordered with avocado, a 2.50 cost, and there was no avocado present in the burrito at all.   Both burritos contained more black beans than any other ingredient - there were maybe 1-2 scrambled eggs in each burrito but how could you taste the egg when every bite contained mostly black beans?  Both burritos had hashed Browns in them, however, my definition of hash browns is crispy fried potato strings and these were virtually raw sliced potatoes with not a single bit of brown showing on them.   For my total cost being 16.50 for the green chile burrito and about 13 for the ranchero this is just a huge huge waste of time and money. I could have eaten at Chelsea's kitchen and had an amazing chilaquiles with breakfast mimosas for the same price and been far far happier.

We went on a busy Sunday morning which is always a nice time for brunch and people watching. we also had just done a vigorous hike prior and were starving! We arrived around 10 am and we were Finally seated around 1045. only 20 mins past the given wait time, and without even an I'm so sorry the wait will be longer then expected or even a general nod in our direction. We were told to download an app and wait for our name to appear, we were never approached about our table being ready.  After being seated our server came by with waters (no straws) She was training a new employee and kindly introduced us to her. She then left the table and didn't return for about 5 mins to take our drink order. 1 beer and the hopes of a taster were ordered. the person who ordered the taster had to wait an extra 7 mins to place her drink order because our server was no where to be found. We were starving and wanting to order, seeing as we had 45 mins before being sat to browse their menu we all already knew what we were after. We finally were able to flag down our server and were able to order.  THE FOOD (actually came out pretty quick) man!!!! I wish I could review the food. I ordered a BREAKFAST BURRITO with the soyrizo (soy Chorizo) instead of eggs. my girlfriends ordered veggie omelets and scrambles, which looked amazing, and pancakes.  I had asked prior if the soyrizo was going to be spicy and was instantly put at ease that it was mild and full of flavor. I had one bite of my burrito and my mouth was on fire. if there was flavor it was masked by the intense amount of spices that were bombarding my taste buds. My girlfriends hash browns was more like wet mush in a ring, and the scramble was almost too much on the wet side for the eggs to have been cooked all the way thru. Too bad our server was also MIA yet again during our ENTIRE MEAL. I would have liked to have tried something I could actually eat considering my stomach was probably growling loud enough for our neighboring table to hear (even over the blaringly loud club dance music they were playing).  THE SERVICE I work in the F&B industry and have been a proud provider of excellent customer service for 15 years ( so I do sorta know what Im talking about, not saying Im the best.... I just understand what makes a complete experience) well we definatly got an experience alright.  Our service LACKED every quality of a good experience.  1)Drink orders were taken 5-12 mins after being seated.  2)we had top flag down our server after being sat for almost 20 mins to have our food order taken 3)NOT ONCE did the server stop by, after getting us the required condiments we had asked for in our food order, to see if our food was even to our liking!!!!! that is ELEMENTRY!!!! my plate was pushed to the side with one bite taken out with a napkin on top of it for close to 38 mins before our server returned. 4) SHE DIDNT EVEN ACKNOLEDGE the uneaten food when she did return 5) When the server was informed that the food was inediable she had the manager take care of it..... funny the manager didn't stop by.  Zero Stars for: Service was POOR and SLOW (the girl she was training was more attentive to the tables) Zero Stars for: The Food well they would probably get more stars if I had even been able to try any of it.   They do get one star however for Décor and Such, this place is super HIP and FUNKY with round booths and an open air concept. This is a place that wants to be seen.

For starters we had Scallops with squid ink caviar and the Apple frisee salad. The entrees were, Sautéed Shrimp, Bacon and Sweet Peppers on a Lacy Corn Cakes with Bourbon Crème Fraiche and Confit Mango and Sierra Nevada Mustard Braised Rabbit Leg and Golden Beet Gnocchi with Aged Balsamic Vinegar Reduction and Crispy Kale. For Dessert, Salame di Cioccolato and Espresso Gelato with Hazelnut Brittle and Sugar Crusted Moist Butter Cake with Blackberry Compote and Granola Crumble  The scallop was well prepared and the ink caviar was interesting. It was a little fishy smelling, but that is squid ink afterall.  The Apple Frisee salad was very very good. Of particular note were the toasted hazelnuts which provided a nice textural contrast and that wonderful crunch.  The sweet and tart contrast in the salad was expertly constructed.  The entrees ordered were on the whole, very disappointing. We ordered the Rabbit leg and the sauteed shrimp.  The sauteed shrimp were inconsistently cooked. More that half of the shrimp were undercooked. The chef would do well to season the shrimp before cooking them. My God, a little salt even. This dish relied exclusively upon the Bourbon Creme Fraiche for flavor. But the fraiche was too oily and left a slickness on the palate.  I didn't even notice any bacon or sweet peppers flavors in this dish. The dish needs some heat to bring it home.  The other dish,  Sierra Nevada Mustard Braised Rabbit Leg and Golden Beet Gnocchi with Aged Balsamic Vinegar Reduction and Crispy Kale. The only redeeming part of this dish were the Golden Beet Gnocchi. The Gnocchi was expertly seasoned and prepared. The Rabbit was unfortunately terribly under seasoned and dry.  The Salame di Cioccolato was nice.  The Salame was more akin to fudge. It incorporated some great flavors. A subtle taste of amaretto, though it wasn't listed. The Espresso Gelato was smooth and flavorful. The brittle was the star. Brillant.  The Sugar Crusted Moist Butter Cake with Blackberry Compote and Granola Crumble was something my aunt Mable would bring to a potluck. The Moist Butter Cake was neither moist  nor buttery. The cake could have been from Sara Lee, but I'm not sure The blackberry compote was uncomplicated and could have come out of a can. The coup de gras was the lack of any granola crumble.  Again, the wait staff was exceptional. The chef needs to watch the Food Channel."}

This clever house of tricks keeps their way over priced, mediocre food and horrible service well hidden until you, and your wallet, have already be taken. Quite the slight of hand!!  I made the mistake of taking my family there for my wife's birthday (6 of us altogether). After sitting for 15 minutes we were greeted by Ben who immediately let us know through his inaction and disinterest that this was going to be a long night of no service. Ben didn't need to be concerned, though-he was getting his tip no matter what he did, or didn't do for this table. Our choice should have been Burger King for the service, if nothing else. Sorry, no disrespect to those who wear the crown ;-). The bottom line-the House of Tricks has THE WORST SERVICE in Arizona!!!   Their overpriced food features barely palatable dishes and the portions are small. If you eat there don't expect any wow from the food. The only wow you will get is when you see the bill!!  In this economy Arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut. We don't need a magic door at the House of Tricks, but we do need it to close!!!"}

I'm certainly glad I called ahead because the place was jam-packed when we got there.  We were given the options of being seated inside now, or outside shortly.  We opted for the latter to enjoy the beautiful night air.  The restaurant bar that we waited at was surprisingly crowded too.  I don't know if they were short-staffed that night, but, the fact that it took almost ten minutes to get the bartenders attention was just and indication of the way the night was going to go.  While the drinks (my manhattan and her mojito) were quite good, they were also quite pricey.  Far more than I thought they were worth.  Whatever, right?  It's for Valentines Day.  Well, that just kind of kept going.  My ribeye was.....fine.  Pretty tasty but....well, maybe I'm just not a fan of ribeye.  The soup, a cauliflower-chorizo blend, was good.  Again, just not worth what we ended up paying for it.  Happily, my girlfriend really enjoyed her foie gras stuffed chicken, at least.  All in all, good, but as a dining event, not worth the $100-ish dollars.  The service is pretty good and the location and ambiance can't be beat.  I'll give it another try, but there is quite a queue of places for me to check first before I rush back."}

It was our first time and we were looking forward to trying their food. We saw people eating and drinking? She went back and asked the kitchen and said that we had 5 minutes to order. We tried to be cool about it and said yes we can order something quick. We were very happy with our meal and left. We have tried going back twice after 9pm. I believe that we saw the manager in a white shirt and waved through the window that they were closed!

The dining room is a dark, lofty, wine cellar-ish space with a Netflix projection on the back wall. Some tables have couch seating, especially on the patio, though most of the inside tables are wooden along with a few high tables. Like the couple seated next to us, it would be romantic and comfortable for those on a first date.   We arrived around six PM on Saturday, a good hour before it would start getting any sort of busy. We were a bit disappointed to be seated at one of the uncomfortable wooden seating areas rather than be seated at a couch, but that's not the end of the world. Although, there was some sort of dark, sticky substance stuck under the table. I assumed it was a result of a balsamic vinegar spill but I'm not sure why it would have thickened to the under-table.  After being seated we waited an unusually long time before our waiter introduced himself... by that time we had already decided what we wanted to drink and an app start with. Instead of taking our drink order he let us know that select wines were on sale and that we should look those over for when he comes back, then he rushed back to the kitchen. When he came back we ordered the sangria carafe we'd previously intended to, to which he confirmed, just so you know, that isn't on sale. I hope the service isn't this awkward when it's busy.  The sangria was nice and sweet with a surprising (and maybe a bit out of place) kick of cinnamon.   We started with bruschetta planks - delicious and creative. For our meal we ordered the Porco pizza - I don't even like pork but it's hearty and shredded addition was undoubtably craveable.   We ordered the creme brulee for dessert and licked that plate clean -- nuff said! Only before that my partner started to feed me a spoon of the dessert and THAT was when our waiter decided to stop by and see how we were doing. Laughing at the awkward, we were just fine."}

The food has a great presentation. It started with this duck appetizer which I loved. The main course, however, was salty to me. I ordered the shrimp. I asked the people in my party how their food was, and they all said theirs was very salty as well, even the vegetarian entree.   So I feel this place had some hits and misses. I would recommend ordering from the regular menu and not so much from the restaurant week menu."}

We went there for restaurant week menu and the menu that was on the table was the wrong one.  Not a big deal just not something I expect.  Now, my pet peeve is when a restaurant that has such a nice menu and atmosphere serves me bread with cold hard butter.  How are you supposed to spread cold hard butter on your bread.  The server said they keep it in the cooler because if they didn't they couldn't scoop it to serve it. This tells me one thing.  They use crappy butter.  Good butter can be stored and should be served at room temp.  No real fine dining establishments will serve you hard butter that is not spreadable.  Other than that irritating me, the pork belly, flat iron, and carrot cake were great."}

My daughter realized she left her purse and went back to get it. A waiter was standing near our table and he looked at her questioningly but still not a word.

(It used to be fairly regularly for us with friends, but we changed our Gammage seats to Sunday a while back and they're closed on Sunday) I wish that I could say we had a good experience like we always used to but it was pretty awful unfortunately.    We eat out at least every other week at busy restaurants, we understand slow service happens, especially on busy nights, (and we arrived 2 hours and 20 minutes ahead of the show to allow for that).  What we didnt understand is a server (I won't mention his name) who from the beginning seemed disconnected, uninterested, and seemed to act as though he didnt want to be there.  Even when things fell apart, he made very little attempt at making things right.  We have always had *exceptional* service every time prior at House of Tricks, so this was just so unexpected.    Our food arrived quite a while after the tables' next to us, even though we arrived before them.  (They ordered almost exactly what we did, so it wasn't the type of food that was the delay) Our table was rarely checked on, (except by the bus-boy with water) and no attempt at an apology was given until I complained about the long delay.  Our server finally checked on us after the food arrived, and ask how everything tasted.  We didnt know, as the bus-boy had taken our silverware and didnt return with any until several minutes after the food arrived.  Overall the food was very good, (Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Portobello Étouffée, and the SeaBass), as good as we remembered.  The service unfortunately was pretty awful, and the $15 credit and free (single) dessert on a tab of over $210 was a sad attempt at trying to make things right.  No sight of the manager either which to me says the service issues extend far beyond the server in question.  House of Tricks was a favorite of ours for many years, it had been a toss-up for us between this and Monarch Cafe for a delicious meal in a beautiful, romantic setting.  After last nights experience I feel as though we have no reason to return.  Such a shame."}

The presentation wasn't nice and it tasted like someone put an unflavored sea bass on a bed of black beans from a can. No flavor to the meal, and someone thought it would be a good idea to put cold tomatoes on the hot food. Also, I used my knife while eating my appetizer.

He proceeded to take our order and offered another bottle of wine. He turned things around for us and that was very appreciated. The server finally stopped by after we were already eating and saw that her manager stopped by. She never apologized but instead stated that she was busy with another table and assumed everything was good. To make things more awkward her blouse came undone, she turned around and giggled.

My wife and I are from California Bay Area, and we've eaten at way better, higher-end places, and NEVER have I seen four other tables (whom arrived after we did) get their food first.  In addition, the gentlemen running the show, came to a table next to ours to fill up water, while my wife's cup was left unattended for a while, before I had to ask him to please fill up our water. When our food comes out (late), I make a point to ask for my check and boxes, a typical indicator that the food took entirely way too long and we are now running late to our concert. My plate was missing the sauce that accompanies the dish,  and the waitress was kind enough to apologize because she as well was surprised by the wait. My wife and I made sure to leave a $20 tip on $90 tab worth of food and drinks (5 total at $10+) so that the waitress knew it was not her fault, but rather the way the tables and food were being managed. I'm convinced our order was not put in until she finally double checked. Thanks to our awesome waitress, however, we would not ever return due to the preferential treatment we observed. Thanks for reminding us we are NOT in an eclectic area of Phoenix, High Street as they proclaim."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Great atmosphere and level of service, but I think the food is overrated.  I arrived on a Tuesday night right at 9 pm on my third visit and sat in the bar area.  Being the month of March, you really can't beat the outdoor seating here. It has a great, romantic atmosphere enclosed by plants and trees. If you were blindfolded and brought here, you wouldn't even know you were next to ASU and Mill Ave.  For dinner I ordered the Spring Mix Salad with Tomato, Cucumber, Radish, Goat Cheese and White Balsamic-Honey Vinaigrette and, for the main course, the Housemade Rag Pasta with Veal Breast Bolognese, Pine Nut-Toasted Fennel, Goat Cheese and Golden Raisin Gastrique. Sounds delicious, right?  The salad was okay, but neither the greens nor the vinaigrette stood out. The main flavors that come out were that of the radishes and goat cheese. None of the delicate nuances of the spring mix--hints of pepper, hints of lemon, hints of bitterness, etc.--came out. For the main course, I just thought that the dish was too heavy. Maybe some people really like it, but, for me, it was too nutty and the sauce way too thick and creamy. Almost soupy. Generally, in restaurants of this caliber, I think of the pasta dishes being lighter so that I can enjoy the delicateness of the housemade pasta, i.e., pasta should not be drowning. I'll leave that up to the Olive Garden to bathe the food in random cream sauce to mask the use of substandard pasta and ingredients.  My dining opinion is that the food does not taste as good as it reads. That being said, taking into account the atmosphere and the level of service I received, this is certainly a place worth visiting with a date, friends, family, co-workers, etc. to be able to enjoy conversing and dining outdoors in a relaxed setting.  On a date night, I would dine somewhere else and then come here and sit outside for dessert and drinks."}

They area is filled with blooming trees and flowers.  The issue is the service. Takes a very long time for drinks to come out and to be checked on. The drinks weren't even consistent. I ordered one drink that was good. I ordered it again, and it was completely different and awful. The food is only okay and not memorable. What is memorable is how the server refused to give us extra plates and silverware because she didn't want us to have a birthday cake someone brought. She claimed it was the law where birthday cakes cannot be served in the restaurant, but I've been to several restaurants where that is not the case. She claimed that we can't have birthday cake because if we get sick, then the restaurant will be to blame. We discovered she is mistaken, and that if you bring birthday cake and get sick, then you acknowledge you cannot blame the restaurant.  I should have asked for the manager, but we were the third to last table there since it took almost two hours to be served. Everyone in out party was just sad and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. I was embarrassed. Thank you for the memorable birthday party. I'll have to be dragged here to come here again."}

A group of us decided to go there for dinner before a show at Gammage. It was restaurant week so we made reservations well in advance allowing plenty of time. We were never asked if we were going to a show. Service was incredibly slow and when we had not yet received appetizers 40 min after placing our order, we were starting to panic. When we finally caught our server we told her that we were attending a 7:30 performance and she seemed so surprised. Food came pretty fast after that but unfortunately, 5 out of 7 dinners were cold. I think the cold meals were all from the restaurant week menu. Too bad as the food was good. We barely finished and rushed out the door, just making it in time for the show. I am sure I will go back again but I think I will stick to lunch from now on.

I served tables for 7 years and I would have been fired if I acted like that to a guest.

{"stars": 2.0, "text": "Food here was pretty good -- but then again we'd waited so long, anything would taste good....service was disappointing (see time stamps/end).  Starting with the positives- the truffle mushroom pizza was really actually pretty delicious. I'm very picky about truffle oil, after I had a very poor experience that turned me off. Anything too overbearing and I won't eat it. This is a good level of truffle oil. The goat cheese is a good balance to the truffle oil, and the basil is light and complementary.  The pasta bolognese though....umm, strange. There was a very clove(?)-y taste to it that was not expected. Maybe that's not my taste which I get. However, the pappardelle (oh, I forgot I'm not a pappardelle person so bad combo maybe) was nowhere close to al dente. It was soggy. OH and lukewarm - but I'll chalk that up to us having to wait 45 minutes for a pasta. The garlic bread with this was the highlight, but also - very lukewarm.   Now service......ok so it was a Friday night. The place wasn't packed, but I guess it was fairly full. Still, my friends walked in and were seated right away. Within 10 minutes of ordering, we get our house salads. Following that - nothing for 35 minutes. idk about you, but I like to eat my salads with my entrees and multiple waiters kept coming to try and take my salad away as I waited another 35 minutes for my pasta/pizza. My friend nearly finished her pinot noir that she had ordered specifically to go with the bolognese as well so I guess you could say we were unimpressed with the wait time.  The part that disappointed me most was seeing multiple parties come in after us, get their food, and LEAVE before we got our food/as our food just arrived. So while I really wanted to like this place, I cannot say I will be coming here again. IF i were to come back, I would order differently and just stick with the pizza though - so keep that in mind if you swing by."}

No other fruit that they show in pictures that other patrons have taken. All of our main entrees for the price, which is extremely expensive, just didn't make the grade, with the exception of the beef tenderloin, which my daughter ordered. She enjoyed that very much.

We waited about 3-4 minutes for a young lady to seat us about 8 feet away from the entrance. Our server was nice, and friendly. We ordered 2 caesar salads and a pizza to split. The salads came out pretty quickly but the pizza took FOREVER. We almost got up and walked out. I would estimate a good 60 minute wait for a pizza. Dont know who fumbled but the server made it right and did not charge us. The pizza dough was good and the topping was Brussel Sprouts. Pretty good but no sauce. Only 2/3rds of the pizza had toppings. It was dark inside and music was so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation. I would come back again despite these exceptions. People make mistakes but they owned up to it and made it right and thats all that matters. Our server was very apologetic. Thanks!"}

So many of the existing comments accurately describe it, that I wasn't sure I'd have anything left to contribute. It's training wheels for a real wine bar - the wine selection is slim pickin's without much excitement. The bruschetta lacks creativity which is disguised by the fact that you get to choose 4 options. The pizza's is mediocre (albeit very good crust) but  decently sized. Realistically, I don't know what I expected from yet another restaurant striving to stand out despite its cliche concept.  The reason I write this is because the food doesn't suck and it's worth it to go on Tuesdays during happy hour. Half off wine, beer and most liquors AND it's buy one pizza get one free. It's a great deal and the price more so matches the quality of food. It is a good deviation from chains and not quite as expensive as a quality independent wine bar. Perfect for an early glass of wine on a Tuesday."}

My husband and I chose the mussels with harissa and chorizo for a starter.  Probably the most delicious mussels I have ever eaten. The grilled bread was great for dipping into the creamy sauce.  I ordered the mustard glazed salmon with toasted brown rice and baby bok choy. The salmon was well cooked but just a tad overdone for me. I felt that the mustard glaze was just spooned on and not actually part of the cooking process. There was too much of the glaze and it completely overpowered the salmon. The toasted  rice tasted like plain old brown rice and the overcooked bok choy didn't go well with the other flavors.   My husband ordered the bison meat loaf. A small portion and nothing special. He loves purple potatoes but did not enjoy them as they were puréed to the consistency of baby food.   Disappointing food for that price point.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the mussels were so good (although they could have been bigger). We were there on a Monday night so perhaps the A kitchen team was not there but I would hope that food would be consistent no matter when you dine.

I kept trying to make eye contact with the servers/hosts but could not seem to get their attention. We were finally seated on the patio, which was very nice and perfect for outdoor dining.  Unfortunately, the service continued to be lacking. We saw our waitress only a few brief times throughout the whole night - once to take our orders, once to give us the dessert menu, and once to collect our money. She was friendly, but the fact remains that she was mostly nowhere to be found.   Despite the mediocre service, the food was great. We shared the mussels for an appetizer, and they were very large and tasty. I ordered the halibut, which was perfectly cooked. My dad got the pork tenderloin, and my mom had the Thai duck, both of which were fantastic as well. The key lime cheesecake we got for dessert was not so good - it had a strange, trying-too-hard-to-be-different tinge to it, and it was drowning in a sea of raspberry sauce. The coffee was lovely though!  All in all, I would go back to (and recommend) House of Tricks because the food has been fairly consistent in quality and its ambiance is a rare find in Phoenix.

I needed to because there is metered parking.  The waiter came by without apologizing for the wait and hurriedly asked for our orders and dashed off. This was a tad irritating.  We ordered the spinach dip to start then I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, and my boyfriend ordered the french dip sandwich.  The appetizer was super delicious! It had roasted poblano in it which gave it a great kick and went well with the toasted baguette.  My sandwich had bacon, goat cheese, fig spread, and arugula on a ciabatta roll. There could have been more goat cheese and fig spread. The grilled chicken was moist but needed more seasoning.The salad that accompanied my meal was fresh with fruit and spinach leaves with a rosemary/balsamic vinaigrette. My boyfriend loves french dip sandwiches but the star of his meal was the au jus dipping sauce not the sandwich.  The jist of this review is that my first impression is a little tainted by the poor service but it evened out with the decent food.  I texted the friend who recommended this place and I told him about the weird service and he replied, Oh you must be sitting outside. As if this should make a difference?

The pistachio butter and jelly on a croissant is interesting, but is more of a novelty than a substantial lunch choice.

For me, it felt a little big, commercial, the decor was kinda cheesy - think red leather chairs, Pier1 Important wall sconces, even a VIP looking lounge in red velour. Hardly, original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic wine bar in my opinion. If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place (call me a snob, whatever). Let's talk about the wine list at this wine bar --- it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red - not ideal for a wine bar. Then, we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves. Knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have clued us in? We ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety. I do have to say, the bruchetta was good.   We were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night (which I do love goes until 6:30pm) but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round. There was no grace period so we paid full price. We did notice, that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim - so maybe 1/2 price = have the wine?   Don't get me wrong... the place is cute enough, would def seem like a fancy date night place if I were still in college. I'd go again with girlfriends but won't be racing back with my husband.   I wish we would have tried more food because that seems to be the key to this place. Ambiance and service are good - not great. Oh, and the music could use some updating.

My husband and I shared the soup special which was a white bean pork soup, the PEI mussels and the osso buco. To drink, my husband had the Franziskaner and I had the Green Thing and a margarita. The soup and mussels came out first. The mussels were good, but I've also cooked mussels as good as these. The soup was lukewarm, we should have sent it back but were with a group and didn't want to be bothersome and it was not as robust or flavorful as expected. They split the osso buco for us which was nice, but it wasn't one of the better osso bucos that I've had. The pork was cooked perfectly, but I felt that the sauce on it was too sweet and a little overpowering. It came with toasted white beans and sugar snap peas which I found to be a strange combo, a potato or other starch would have been better. The dish included gruyere, but the amount was so little that it didn't really add to the dish. My husband chose the flourless brownie for dessert and it was a bit on the dry side. I took one bite and it was good but not great, and not enough for me to want to waste the calories on. My favorite thing that I had was the Green Thing cocktail which had fresh cucumber and gin, it was delicious and very refreshing.

There was one waiter being diligent and attentive. But he wasn't ours. We ate every morsel appreciating the local fresh ingredients--but paid cash to get out the door and on with a busy day."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "I'm from out of town and I came to La Bocca Urban Pizzeria based on the Yelp rating and reviews.   The inside of the restaurant looks pretty cozy and contemporary. They specialize in pizza. We came during their happy hour--only on select drinks. We were given time to look at the menu... a lot of time! It was as if they forgot about us. Impossible, because the restaurant was filled probably 15-20% capacity.  After ~15-20 minutes of reading the menu (probably two or three times) we ordered (finally!). I got the bocca trio which had 3 different types of meat--that was pretty good! My friend got the margarita--impossible to mess up. My other friend got the Garlic which, in my opinion, tasted TOO garlicy. I only had one slice of her pizza and told myself no more.  I think the reason why this is a 3 star review instead of a 4 star review is because the waitress was just very cold towards us. I don't know if she was just having a bad day. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't mean or anything, but just the air around her felt very unwelcoming.   Try it out? Maybe you'll get a more happier wait staff when you go"}

I made a online reservation for Sat night, however upon arrival I found that was not necessary as they were not full.   We started with the Ahi watermelon salad $13. It has 3 small slices of sashimi and 8 blocks of watermelon with some greens and a wasabi glaze. It was good but very very small.  For our mains we had a Potato chip wrapped wild sea bass on a plat of beans and sauce $30. The Fish was bit over cooked and too firm, the beans and sauce lacked much flavor. We also had the Goat Cheese veggie  Lasagna $20, While it did look nice topped with Julianned squash and a nice swoosh of pesto on the plate, it was nothing special.   The bread comes with a sweet butter which is nice.   We had some wine by the glass that was decently priced for the environment.  Overall it was an impressive place for a date however the food did not impress."}

We were trying to make it before happy hour but since our server took so long to get to us, we missed happy hour entirely."}

We had the organgecello because they were out of the lemon. Man what a treat! The orange wasn't on the menu. We had an assortment of planks including on with smoked salmon, very good. We also had the mushroom pizza very good. I didn't taste the garlic pizza, I'm assuming it wasn't as good as the mushroom because it's the only thing that got boxed up. OK , three people, two pizzas, a plank and about 8 drinks for under $70 bucks. My next visit will be on a Sunday because of the specials. I will ask for the orangecello after I have warm Queen Creek olives with crusty bread (thanks for tip fellow yelpers) and a glass of wine. I think the ultimate question always is will I go back and the answers once more is yes! (on a Sunday)!   Oh yeah a great space, we sat inside in a area with a couch and low tables.. very cute and cozy.  Good eclectic mix of music,  love the huge painting over the bar.    Peace"}

The table was next to untrimmed plants and flies were flying around during all the dinner.  I was craving pork belly and when I ordered, the waiter said that that was the only dish they didn't have. Great. I ordered cheese plate (which was the best of the night), baked potato soup (lame), fillet (with too much sauce and peppers, plus the spinach had no taste) and a side of caramelized onion risotto (which was a little more than ok).  In general good location, nice setting but just lame overpriced food.  Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This is the best pizza in Tempe. It's also a rare Tempe restaurant with a pleasant adult atmosphere. However, if you are from Phoenix you will probably leave underwhelmed. Phoenix is awash in amazing Pizza restaurants and that trend weirdly ends at the Tempe border. It's like a glitch in Capitalism. Anyway La Boca is at least half way there. The pizza is good if not great. The salads are tasty combinations but with ample lettuce and skimpy toppings. If you are accustomed to the bruschetta at Postino, the bruschetta is a disappointment- again very skimpy toppings. It wasn't bad. I'll be back because I live in Tempe now and it's convenient but if this restaurant could take a page from Cibo, Bianco, Pomo, Federal Pizza, etc. and improve the taste and quality a little bit, they would be packed all the time."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Pretty generic kind of dining place. It's not like the food was any bad but this could have been any other American food place. Standard fare of appetizers, salads soups and main course. The stuff on the main course was the standard fish white meat and red meat. No vegetarian fare. Really can't give this very standard places any higher score."}

I would go there in the evening but never for lunch for the next two years while a Multi story apartment building is being built across the street. The noise is Beyond belief.  My advice is stay away during lunch and only go at night."}

{"stars": 3.0, "text": "Pretty good. Not spectacular enough to come back. Maybe for HH. The service was meh! Waiter did not know the food nor the wine list. He was not upscale waiter material by any means, more like Keanu Reeves trying to serve. Whoa, need some wine dude? I Had to send him back to the chef to ask about food Ingredients . Had no idea. Thats no good when average prices for plates are around $25. Small portions for the price. I know it is upscale cuisine but I was starving after my $29 meal. The herbed butter with bread was too powerful. Should be a subtle flavor. It was good but not worth going back to IMO."}
{"stars": 3.0, "text": "This place was pretty good and has a trendy hipster feel to it. The beet salad was yummy and the pasta freshly made. The reason for 3 stars was the service at the bar. The bartender seemed a little out of their league for the amount of business they had at the time...maybe not the usual bartender they have??"}
